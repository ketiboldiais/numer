	<h3>TypeScript</h3>
	<p>TypeScript is a <span class="term">superset</span> of JavaScript. It's a language that builds up on JavaScript. In a way, it's similar to how C++ builds on top of C, but the syntactic differences between TypeScript and JavaScript are nowhere near as dramatic (granted, time will determine whether this remains true).</p>
	<p>Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript cannot be executed by the browser. Instead, TypeScript code must be <span class="italicsText">compiled</span> into JavaScript.</p>
