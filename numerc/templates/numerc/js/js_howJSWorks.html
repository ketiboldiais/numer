<h1>How Does JavaScript Work?</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		Before we take a closer look at JavaScript, it's helpful to have some
		understanding of how JavaScript works. This is because unlike other
		languages, JavaScript has a unique relationship to web browsers.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we know, in order to execute a program, the computer must perform two
		things: (1) allocate space in memory for our program's data and (2) provide
		a thread from the CPU to actually execute the program's instructions.
		JavaScript is no different. Whenever we execute JavaScript source code,
		memory is allocated and a thread is provided.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we also know, to allocate memory and request a thread, the computer must
		be instructed to do so. The computer, however, only understands 1s and 0s.
		We could write our instructions in 1s and 0s, but that would be cumbersome.
		Because of this difficulty, computer engineers created assembly, which
		abstracts those 1s and 0s into English instructions. However, assembly is
		unique to the computer's architecture, and computers have different
		architectures. If all we had was assembly, we'd have to learn different
		assembly languages to write our programs. Because of this difficulty, we
		have low-level languages like C, which abstract away assembly into
		human-readable code.
	</p>
	<p>
		With C, however, we have to be very careful and strict about the way we
		write our instructions. Most significantly, the programmer bears the burden
		of managing memory. Fail to meet that burden, and the program crashes. And
		it's very easy to manage memory poorly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of this difficulty, we have higher-level languages like JavaScript.
		These languages do all the things that would make our lives more difficult.
		They manage memory, provide syntactic sugar (faster, shorter, or more
		intuitive ways to write instructions), and idioms (readily made constructs
		for accomplishing common programming tasks).
	</p>
	<p>
		For these higher-level languages to work, however, they have to be reduced
		to 1s and 0s (again, computers only understand 1s and 0s). There are many
		ways to achieve this reduction. In modern JavaScript, that reduction is
		achieved through a JavaScript engine. A JavaScript engine is a program that
		aids in the execution of JavaScript source code. How it aids that execution
		depends on the engine; there are many different engines, varying by browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		On Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, the JavaScript engine is V8. On
		Firefox, it's SpiderMoney. On Safari, it's JavaScriptCore. On Internet
		Explorer, it's Chakra. The way these engines are implemented determines what
		they do in the path from source code to bits.
	</p>
	<p>Let's look at V8, by far the most widely-used engine.</p>
