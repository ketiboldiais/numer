		<span class="topic">Lexical Environment.</span> The world "lexical" means
		"having to do with words or grammar." Some programming languages, like
		JavaScript, have <span class="term">lexical environments</span>. If a
		programming language has a
		<span class="italicsText">lexical environment</span>, then the lines where
		we write code <span class="underlineText">matters</span>. In other words,
		you cannot just write anything, anywhere. For example:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		function hello() {
			greeting = "Hello world!"
			console.log(greeting);
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>Briefly, variables in JavaScript are indicated with the symbols:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="monoText">let</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">const</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">var</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When writing variable names, the convention is to use only ASCII characters,
		but we are free to use the full set of Unicode characters.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the code above, the variable <span class="monoText">greeting</span> sits
		<span class="italicsText">lexically</span> inside the function
		<span class="monoText">hello()</span>. Moreover, if a programming language
		has a <span class="italicsText">lexical environment</span>, then the
		language gives us an idea of where in the computer's memory our code
		resides, and how it will interact with other parts of the program. Put
		simply, whenever we use the term
		<span class="italicsText">lexical environment</span>, we are referring to
		<span class="underlineText">where</span> the code is in the program, and
		<span class="underlineText">what</span> surrounds that code.
