<h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
<section id="async_js">
	<p>
		When we execute JavaScript code, the JavaScript interpreter uses a
		<b>call stack</b> to keep track of its place during execution. The call
		stack is <i>stack</i> data structure. This is a very simple data
		structure that looks, and behaves, exactly as it sounds: The last thing
		we place on the stack is the first thing we get from the stack, and the
		first thing we place in the stack is the last thing we get from the
		stack. For example, a stack of dishes to be washed. The dish from
		yesterday is beneath the dish from today, and the dish from
		ereyesterday is beneath the dish from yesterday. When we wash them, we
		wash the dish from today, then the dish from yesterday, then the dish
		from ereyesterday.
	</p>
	<p>
		In JavaScript, the call stack operates like the dish washing example.
		Suppose the following functions are called sequentially:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{f(x), g(x), h(x)} $$</figure>
	<p>
		When JavaScript executes the first function, ${\texttt{f(x)}}$ it
		generates a
		<i>stack frame</i> for ${\texttt{f(x)}}$ and pushes that frame
		<i>pushes</i> ${\texttt{f(x)}}$ to the call stack:
	</p>
	<div id="stack1"></div>
	<p>
		When it encounters ${\texttt{g(x)}}$ it generates another stack frame
		for ${\texttt{g(x)}}$ pushes that to the call stack:
	</p>
	<div id="stack2"></div>
	<p>And when it counters ${\texttt{h(x)},}$ the same process occurs:</p>
	<div id="stack3"></div>
	<p>
		Once ${\texttt{h(x)}}$ finishes executing, its stack frame is
		<i>popped off</i> the stack:
	</p>
	<div id="stack4"></div>
	<p>
		When ${\texttt{g(x)}}$ finishes executing, it too is popped off the
		stack:
	</p>
	<div id="stack5"></div>
	<p>
		This leaves ${\texttt{f(x)}}$ and once ${\texttt{f(x)}}$ finishes
		executing, it's popped off the stack. This control flow applies whether
		${\texttt{g(x)}}$ and ${\texttt{h(x)}}$ are inside ${\texttt{f(x)},}$
		or whether they are all separate functions in the program. Nesting,
		however, impacts the order the call stacks are generated, pushed, and
		popped. In general, when want to determine the order a function's stack
		frames are generated, pushed, and popped, we want to read the program
		top to bottom, right to left.
	</p>
	<p>
		This phenomenon of pushing and popping stack frames stems from a
		fundamental trait of JavaScript: JavaScript is a
		<b>single-threaded language</b>. A single-threaded language is a
		language with a single call stack and a single memory heap. In effect,
		this means that within the language, we can only run one statement at a
		time. Because of this trait, JavaScript programs live in a
		<b>synchronous environment</b> &mdash; an environment where functions
		return (i.e., are popped off) only after they have finished executing.
		Think carefully about what this means. Necessarily, when we call a
		function ${f,}$ nothing else in the program can run. All other
		functions must wait until ${f}$ finishes. This is the defining
		characteristic of the <b>synchronous programming</b>. Tasks are done
		one at a time; there's no such thing as &#8220;multitasking.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		The opposite of a single-threaded language is a
		<b>multithreaded language</b>. With a multithreaded language, we can
		perform simultaneous executions of two or more parts of the program
		(e.g., functions). Multithreading is a defining characteristic of
		<b>parallel programming</b> &mdash; programming where functions need
		not wait for another function to return before executing. Not very many
		languages have built-in support for multithreading. Languages like C++
		and Java provide multithreading only if the operating system permits
		it. We will see in a moment why multithreading is a relatively rare
		feature.
	</p>
	<p>
		The opposite of the synchronous environment is an
		<b>asynchronous environment</b> &mdash; an environment where multiple
		functions run and return at various points in time. With an
		asynchronous environment, we can perform
		<b>asynchronous programming</b>: When we call a function ${f,}$ the
		program continues to run, calling other functions like ${g}$ and ${h.}$
		When ${f}$ finishes, great, we can use ${f}$'s return value. If not, we
		can continue working on other things.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can compare asynchronous programming and synchronous programming
		with the following analogy: We have to make a caramel glaze and bake a
		cake. Under the synchronous programming model, we must do one or the
		other, not both, before proceeding to the next. In other words, we have
		to finish making the glaze before baking the cake, or we have to finish
		baking the cake before making the glaze. In the asynchronous
		programming model, we can start baking the pie, then while it's in the
		oven, we move on to the glaze, waiting for the pie to finish.
	</p>
	<p>
		We might be thinking, why don't all languages just default to
		multithreaded implementations? If they did so, we would be able to
		perform asynchronous programming as needed. It is, after all, much more
		efficient to work on the glaze while the cake bakes. The answer lies in
		thinking a little more carefully on the analogy. Preparing a glaze
		alongside baking a cake is actually much more complex than it seems. If
		we start the glaze too early, it can harden, decreasing its viscosity.
		Start too late, and we can burn the cake.
	</p>
	<p>
		This same difficulty extends to multithreaded programs. It can be much
		more difficult to reason about what a multithreaded program does at any
		given point in time. We have to keep track of different functions
		executing at once. Moreover, if we reflect a little more deeply, we'd
		realize that we aren't very good at multitasking ourselves. Sure, we
		can tie our shoelaces while talking to someone, but if the conversation
		was on the mechanics of the proof for &#8220;This statement is a
		theorem,&#8221; no doubt we would pause. In fact, some tasks are so
		involved that we have laws ensuring we don't multitask: &#8220;No
		person may drive ... any motor vehicle while composing or sending an
		electronic text message or an electronic mail message.&#8221; Wis.
		Stat. §346.89(3)(a).
	</p>
	<p>
		Nevertheless, there are some tasks that we can reason about easily. And
		there are some tasks that we <i>want</i> to perform while performing
		another. The fact that these tasks exist is partly why we have
		Bluetooth headsets and speech-to-text software. This extends to
		JavaScript programs. In fact, many websites rely on asynchronous
		programming. When we click the &#8220;Watch&#8221; button on Netflix, a
		request is sent to a server to retrieve the relevant video file. This
		is done with a function, and that function can take time. The page,
		however, doesn't just freeze while the program waits for the function
		to finish. Instead, we're greeted with some animations indicating some
		loading is going on in the background. These animations are performed
		with functions. How does JavaScript achieve something like this?
	</p>
</section>

<section id="asynchronous_callbacks">
	<h2>Asychronous Callbacks</h2>
	<p>
		The more general question is, how do we implement asynchronous programs
		in a synchronous environment? The answer is through
		<b>asynchronous callbacks</b> (also called
		<i>call-after functions</i>). The callback functions we saw in the
		previous examples are instances of <b>synchronous callbacks</b> &mdash;
		callbacks that execute immediately. With asynchronous callbacks, the
		callback is executed only after some delay; i.e., at a later point in
		time. These asynchronous callbacks are done one of two methods: a
		<b>one-shot timer</b> implemented with the
		<var>setTimeOut()</var> method, or an <b>interval timer</b>,
		implemented with the <var>setInterval()</var> method.
	</p>
	<p>The template for the <var>setTime()</var> method:</p>
	<ul class="syntax">
		<li>setTimeOut(f, t)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In the template above, ${f}$ is some function, and ${t}$ is an integer
		value of time, measured in milliseconds. And the template for the
		<var>setInterval()</var> method:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>setInterval(${f}$, ${I}$)</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here, ${f}$ is some function, and ${I}$ is an integer value of time,
		measured in milliseconds. With
		<var>setInterval()</var>, the function ${f}$ is called every ${I}$
		milliseconds (hence an <i>interval time</i>). Furthermore,
		<var>setInterval()</var> returns a numeric value ${v}$ that can be used
		to stop the timer. This is done by calling the method
		<var>clearTimeout()</var>, passing ${v}$ as an argument &mdash;
		<var>clearTimeout(${v}$)</var>.
	</p>
	<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		function f1() {
			console.log("f1 started.");
			alert("Proceed?");
			console.log("f1 finished.")
		 }
		function f2() {
			console.log("f2 started.");
			console.log("f1 finished.");
		}
		f1();
		f2();
	</code></pre>
	<p>The output:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		f1 started.
		f1 finished.
		// ALERT
		f2 started.
		f2 finished.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Executing the code above, we see JavaScript's typical synchronous
		behavior. The function <var>f1()</var> executes first. When it reaches
		the <var>alert()</var> call, it stops and waits for us to click the
		<var>OK</var> button. The function <var>f2()</var> does not execute
		until we respond with the necessary feedback.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			This behavior &mdash; an evaluation being performed only if the
			previous evaluation has finished &mdash; is called <b>blocking</b>.
			Blocking can lead to many undesirable consequences. For example, if a
			particular evaluation takes a long time to process, our program is
			effectively stuck. It would be far more time-efficient to perform
			other evaluations while the longer evaluation processes.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		The simplest way to make the code above asynchronous is to use a
		<var>setTimeOut()</var> function. The <var>setTimeOut()</var> function
		takes a function as an argument, and executes it after a given amount
		of time:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		function f1() {
			setTimeout(function () {
				console.log("f1 started.");
				alert("Proceed?");
				console.log("f1 finished.");
			}, 1000);
		}
		function f2() {
			console.log("f2 started.");
			console.log("f2 finished.");
		}
		f1();
		f2();
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		f2 started.
		f2 finished.
		// Alert
		f1 started.
		f1 finished.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice that the call order has changed. This is because we've set a
		time out on the <var>f1()</var> function. <var>f1()</var> is called,
		and after 1 second, <var>f2()</var> is called. In other words, other
		functions are called while <var>f1()</var> waits &mdash;
		<var>f1()</var> is an <b>asynchronous function</b>. The function inside
		<var>setTimeOut</var> is a <b>callback function</b>.
	</p>
	<div class="mainIdea">
		<p>
			The <var>setTimeOut()</var> function is really an event. When we
			place the callback function inside a
			<var>setTimeOut()</var> function, we're essentially making the
			function <var>f1()</var> say,
			<q>Go on ahead without me, I'll catch up when I'm ready.</q> When is
			<var>f1()</var> ready? When the event &mdash;
			<i>the time expiring upon our clicking <var>OK</var></i> &mdash; has
			occurred.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Question: But isn't JavaScript itself executing these functions? In
		other words, itsn't JavaScript running another process (keeping track
		of time) while it continues executing the next function? This is an
		astute observation, but the answer is no. These methods are called by
		JavaScript, but executed by the <i>browser</i>. This is JavaScript's
		secret to asynchrony (well, not quite; it's public knowledge, just not
		widely-known). Because JavaScript only has one thread to rely on, it
		sends the tasks of keeping tracking of the delay's time and reminding
		to execute to another program's thread &mdash; the browser's.
	</p>
	<p>
		So now the question is how does this work? Recall that JavaScript lives
		only in a hosted environment. One of these environments is the browser,
		a program more than likely written in C++. Browsers provide numerous
		interfaces, one of which provides methods like
		<var>setTimeout()</var> and <var>setInterval()</var>. When the
		JavaScript engine encounters a call like <var>setTimeout()</var>, it
		generates a stack frame for the function, and pushes it onto the call
		stack as it would any other. Once at the call stack, however, the call
		stack itself recognizes <var>setTimeout()</var> as one of the browser's
		web API functions and hands them over to the browser. The browser then
		starts a timer, per our argument. Once the time passes, the browser
		inserts a <b>timeout event</b> to a data structure called the
		<b>event queue</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The event queue is exactly what it sounds like: A line of entities in
		waiting. The queue exhibits a behavior we're all familiar with &mdash;
		if you're the first in line, you're the first one out (assuming an
		orderly society). In this case, the timeout event inserted into the
		queue includes the function we want executed after the delay. Once the
		timer is over, the JavaScript engine processes the call as usual.
	</p>
	<p>
		With callbacks, we can <i>simulate</i> what looks like multithreaded
		programming, but is not. To understand this simulation, we have to be
		clear about the distinction between single-threaded programs,
		multi-threaded programs, synchronous programs, and asynchronous
		programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a <b>single-threaded program</b>, only one command is executed in a
		single process. As we know, JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
		All JavaScript programs are single-threaded. In a
		<b>multi-threaded program</b>, multiple commands are executed within a
		single process. Multi-threaded programs are possible only if the
		operating system supports it. For example, on a Windows system with the
		ThreadFiber package, we can write multi-threaded C programs. In a
		<b>synchronous program</b>, commands are executed one by one,
		immediately after one another. Before we encountered the asynchronous
		callback functions we saw above, our JavaScript programs have been
		synchronous. In an <b>asynchronous program</b>, commands are executed
		one by one, but some commands are delayed (i.e., executed later). We
		can compare these different approaches via diagram.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the graph below, the red plot corresponds to the usual
		<i>synchronous</i> program, a single thread running linearly. The white
		circles indicate points of delay (in this case, there's a delay of
		${0.5}$). The blue plot corresponds to a <i>multithreaded</i> program,
		two threads running linearly and simultaneously. The green plot
		corresponds to an <i>asynchronous</i> program &mdash; a single thread
		running linearly, but calls are made to other functions in the event of
		a delay. When a delay of the first function call occurs, the second
		function is executed. If the delay finishes during the second
		function's execution (as indicated below), the second function's
		execution is interrupted and the first function finishes executing.
		Once the first function finishes, the second function continues:
	</p>
	<figure class="block">
		<div id="thread_compare"></div>
		<figcaption>
			Synchronous (red plot), asynchronous (green plot), and multithreaded
			(blue plot),
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Comparing these three approaches, we can see that the multithreaded
		approach takes the least amount of time, and the synchronous approach
		takes the longest. The asynchronous approach straddles the middle
		ground &mdash; not as fast as a multithreaded program, but not as slow
		as a synchronous program. Once again, with asynchronous callbacks,
		JavaScript is not setting a timer and keeping track of it. It hands
		that work to the browser for handling. Once the timer has finished, the
		function we delayed is placed on the callstack.
	</p>

	<section id="advantages_and_disadvantages_of_asynchrony">
		<h3>Tradeoffs: Asynchronous Programming</h3>
		<p>
			There are costs and benefits to asynchronous programming. Synchronous
			code is far easier to write and reason about. As we've seen, however,
			it can lead to blocking. And because of blocking, there are
			situations where synchronous code is less perfomant. Time is the most
			valuable resource in programming, and it's wasted waiting.
		</p>
		<p>
			With asynchronous programming, our code is more performant. The cost:
			Code is harder to read and reason about. Asynchronous code is also
			just harder to write well in general.
		</p>

</section>

<section id="promises">
	<h2>Promises</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>promise</b> is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual
		successful or failed completion of some asynchronous operation. The
		name is indicative of what it represents &mdash; it's a promise that
		some value will be returned, whether or not the operation succeeds.
		Let's take a closer look at this object.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		const func = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})
		console.log(func);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		[[Prototype]]: Promise
		[[PromiseState]]: "pending"
		[[PromiseResult]]: undefined
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We see that the <var>func</var> is a <var>Promise</var> object, with
		two properties; <var>PromiseState</var>, which is initially set to
		<var>pending</var>, and <var>PromiseResult</var>, which is set to
		<var>undefined</var>. Notice that the <var>Promise</var> object takes a
		function in its constructor. That function has two parameters,
		traditionally called <var>resolve</var> and <var>reject</var>, both of
		which are functions. The idea is as follows:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			If our promise is fulfilled, the <var>resolve()</var> function
			executes, and the <var>PromiseState</var> is set to
			<var>resolved</var>.
		</li>
		<li>
			If our promise is not fulfilled, the <var>reject()</var> function
			executes, and the <var>PromiseState</var> is set to
			<var>rejected</var>.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		For example, consider the following <var>Promise</var>, which is
		randomly resolved or rejected:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5) {
				reject();
			} else {
				resolve();
			}
		})
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Each time we execute the code above, the promise is randomly rejected
		or resolved. Now, if the promise is resolved, then we can call the
		<var><mark>.then()</mark></var> method:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
		p.then(() => {});
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The <var>.then()</var> method takes a callback function as an argument.
		If the promise <var>p</var> is resolved, then the callback function
		inside <var>.then()</var> is called. For example, in the code below,
		the callback function inside the <var>p.then()</var> is called only if
		<var>x &lt; 2</var> In this case, it is, so we see the console output
		<var>Promise resolved.</var> Had we changed <var>x</var> to
		<var>1</var>, we would see no output.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		let x = 1;
		const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			if (x &lt; 2) {
				resolve();
			} else { 
				reject();
			}
		})

		p.then(() => {
			console.log("Promise resolved.");
		})
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Promise resolved.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		So, we have <var>.then()</var> for the case when
		<var>resolve()</var> occurs, do we have anything for
		<var>reject()</var>? Yes. For the case when the promise is rejected
		&mdash; the result of executing <var>reject()</var> &mdash; we can pass
		a callback function into the promise's
		<var><mark>.catch()</mark></var> method:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		let x = 2;
		const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			if (x &lt; 2) {
				resolve();
			} else { 
				reject();
			}
		})

		p.then(() => {
			console.log("Promise resolved.");
		}).catch(() => {
			console.log("Promise rejected.")
		})
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Promise rejected.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This might seem like a lot of work for something that just looks like
		conditional branching, but there is a subtle value behind all of this:
		The identifier <var>p</var> always has a value &mdash; a
		<var>Promise</var>, which always has its
		<var>PromiseState</var> initialized: It's either <var>pending</var>,
		<var>rejected</var>, or <var>resolved</var>.
	</p>

	<section id="returning_promises_from_functions">
		<h3>Returning Promises</h3>
		<p>
			A common idiom in asynchronous JavaScript is returning a promise from
			a given function. For example, consider the following function:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
				input: process.stdin,
				output: process.stdout
			})

			let x;

			readline.question('Provide your number: ', i => {x = i});

			const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
				setTimeout(() => {
					if (x &lt; 2) { resolve(); }
					else { reject(); }
				}, 5000)
			})

			p.then(() => {
				console.log("Promise resolved.");
			}).catch(() => {
				console.log("Promise rejected.")
			})
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			In the program above, the user is prompted to enter some number. If
			the user does not enter a number within ${5}$ seconds, the promise is
			rejected. If the user enters a number and it's not less than ${2,}$
			the promise is rejected. If the user enters a number within ${5}$
			seconds <em>and</em> it's less than ${2,}$ the promise is resolved.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can also return the promise from a function. This allows us to
			condition whether to return a promise or not:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
				input: process.stdin,
				output: process.stdout
			})
			let x;
			readline.question('Provide your number: ', i => {x = i});
			const p = () => {
				return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
					setTimeout(() => {
						if (x &lt; 2) { resolve(); }
						else { reject(); }
					}, 5000)
				})
			}
			
			p().then(() => { console.log("Promise resolved.") })
				 .catch(() => { console.log("Promise rejected.") })
		</code></pre>

	<section id="valued_rejections_resolves">
		<h3>Valued Rejections &amp; Resolutions</h3>
		<p>

	<h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
	<p>
		Promises may not appear all that useful until we consider HTTP
		requests. To get data from a server, our web application must send a
		request under the HTTP (or these days, HTTPS) request. In JavaScript,
		those requests are made with
		<b>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)</b>. As explained later, XML
		has been largely replaced with JSON in modern web development.
		Accordingly, the more accurate acronym would be <i>AJAJ</i>, but
		changing well-established acronyms in the software industry is akin to
		unscrambling eggs.
	</p>
	<p>
		XML and JSON are <i>data formats</i> &mdash; a set of rules for how
		data should be organized. By having a common set of rules, different
		software systems can share data with one another. For example, suppose
		we had the following data in a spreadsheet:
	</p>
	<table class="csv">
		<thead>
			<th>item</th>
			<th>quantity</th>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>banana</td>
				<td>4413</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>coconut</td>
				<td>1531</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>mango</td>
				<td>1283</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>In XML, the table above might look something like:</p>

		<h3>XML HTTP Requests</h3>
		<p>
			To make an XML HTTP request, we first begin by making a new XML HTTP
			request object, using the
			<var><mark>XMLHttpRequest()</mark></var> method. This method is
			provided by the browser:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Then, we use the <var><mark>.open()</mark></var> method to initialize
			the new request, followed by call to <var><mark>.send()</mark></var
			>, to actually send the request. Notice that the
			<var>.open()</var> method takes the argument <var>'GET'</var>.
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
			req.open('GET', 'https://some_url.com/some_API/some_data/');
			req.send();
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			There is, however, something we forget to include: Code to execute in
			the event the request fails. Remember, when making HTTP requests, we
			must always have some behavior in the event we don't get a respone
			back from the server. We never write code under the assumption that
			we will always get back an HTTP request. In this case, we can use
			event listeners to address the two cases: Either we get a response
			(the <var>'load'</var> case), or we don't (the
			<var>'error'</var> case):
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const req = new XMLHttpRequest();

			req.addEventListener('load', () => {
				console.log('response received');
			});

			req.addEventListener('error', () => {
				console.log('error');
			})

			req.open('GET', 'https://some_url.com/some_API/some_data/');
			req.send();
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The code above will return an error because of the bogus URL, but
			suppose we did get a response back. How do we read the data returned?
			Well, let's just look at the <var>req</var> object. Executing
			<var>console.log(req)</var>, we get:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			onabort: null
			onerror: null
			onload: null
			onloadend: null
			onloadstart: null
			onprogress: null
			onreadystatechange: null
			ontimeout: null
			readyState: 0
			response: ""
			<mark>responseText: ""</mark>
			responseType: ""
			responseURL: ""
			responseXML: null
			status: 0
			statusText: ""
			timeout: 0
			upload: XMLHttpRequestUpload {onloadstart: null, onprogress: null, onabort: null, onerror: null, onload: null, …}
			withCredentials: false
			[[Prototype]]: XMLHttpRequest
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The data we get back is contained in the property
			<var><mark>responseText</mark></var
			>. This property contains the JSON format of the data sent as a
			<i>string</i>. Because this is a string value, we must parse it into
			an actual JavaScript object using the browser's
			<var><mark>JSON.parse()</mark></var> method, and bind the return to a
			variable:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const req = new XMLHttpRequest();

			req.addEventListener('load', () => {
				console.log('response received');

				<mark>const data = JSON.parse(req.responseText);</mark>

			});

			req.addEventListener('error', () => {
				console.log('error');
			})

			req.open('GET', 'https://some_url.com/some_API/some_data/');
			req.send();
		</code></pre>
	</section>

	<section id="fetch">
		<h3>The <var>fetch()</var> Method</h3>
		<p>
			Examining the <var>XMLHttpRequest()</var> method, we can see how
			clunky it is in terms of syntax. Fortunately, browsers provide an
			alternative method for sending requests: the
			<var><mark>fetch()</mark></var> method.
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const p = fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice that for the <var>fetch()</var> method, we pass a single
			argument, the URL to the API. (The URL above is an actual API). If we
			run <var>console.log(p)</var>, we see the following:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			Promise {&lt;fulfilled&gt;: Response}
				[[Prototype]]: Promise
				[[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled"
				[[PromiseResult]]: Response
				body: (...)
				bodyUsed: false
				headers: Headers {}
				ok: true
				redirected: true
				status: 200
				statusText: ""
				type: "cors"
				url: "https://pipedream.com/apps/swapi"
				[[Prototype]]: Response
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The <var>fetch()</var> method returns a promise. If we get back a
			response, the promise state is set to <var>fulfilled</var>, and we
			have access to a property called <var>body</var>. This is a
			<i>bytestream</i> of the data we requested. The name is descriptive
			&mdash; it's a continuous stream of data that we can read from as
			needed.<sup></sup> How do we read data from this stream? Well, we got
			back a promise, so we can use the <var>.then()</var> method, along
			with the <var><mark>.json()</mark></var> method to parse the
			bytestream as as JSON:
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				The <var>fetch()</var> method returns a bytestream because response
				objects could potentially be massive collections of data. E.g.,
				data about flight movements around the world would be a gargantuan
				amount of data that doesn't need to be sent all at once, as users
				might only need a subset of that data.
			</p>
		</div>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const p = fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/planets').then((response) => {
				console.log(response.json().then((data) => {
					console.log(data);
				}));
			})
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			{count: 60, next: 'https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2', previous: null, results: Array(10)}
			count: 60
			next: "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2"
			previous: null
			results: (10) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]
			[[Prototype]]: Object
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice how we had to chain two <var>.then()</var> methods. This is
			because the <var>.json()</var> method returns another promise. The
			data we want parsed into JSON could potentially be massive, taking a
			significant amount of time.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="axios">
		<h3>Axios</h3>
		<p>
			One mild annoyance with the <var>fetch()</var> method is that we
			potentially have to chain many <var>.then()</var> calls to get the
			data we want:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			fetch('some_url')
				.then(check_status_and_parse)
				.then(get_data)
				.then(get_data_inside_data)
				.then(check_status_and_parse)
				.then(get_data)
				.then(get_data_inside_data)
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This isn't necessarily a problem, but there are JavaScript libraries
			that make implementing requests easier. The most popular, currently,
			is <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a>. Axios doesn't
			do anything we can't already do &mdash; the library uses
			<var>fetch()</var> behind the scenes &mdash; but it provides some
			syntax that greatly reduces the amount of code we have to write.
		</p>
		<p>
			The simplest way to use Axios is through a CDN link. In our HTML
			document, we include the script tag before our
			<var>app.js</var> file (the main driver for our simple website):
		</p>
		<pre class="language-html"><code>
			&lt;script 
				src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js&quot;
			&gt;
			&lt;/script&gt;
		</code></pre>
		<p>Once included, getting data is straightforward:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2')
		</code></pre>
		<p>To get the data, we just use the <var>.then()</var> method:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2')
				.then((resp) => {
					console.log(resp.data);
				})
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice that we don't have to parse the bytestream ourselves. Axios
			handles that for us. We just have to read the response's
			<var>.data</var> property.
		</p>

<section id="async_functions">
	<h2>Asynchronous Functions</h2>
	<p>
		The <var><mark>async</mark></var> keyword in JavaScript allows us to
		write asynchronous functions quickly. For example, here's a standard
		function in JavaScript:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		function f() {
			return 'a string'
		}
		console.log(f());
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		a string
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now examine the return value for <var>f()</var> when we use the
		<var>async</var> keyword:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		async function f() {
			return 'a string';
		}
		console.log(f());
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Promise {&lt;fulfilled&gt;: 'success'}
			[[Prototype]]: Promise
			[[PromiseState]]: "fulfilled"
			[[PromiseResult]]: "a string"
	</code></pre>
	<p>We get back a promise. This allows us to write:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		async function f() {
			return 'a string';
		}

		f().then((val) => {
			console.log(`Fulfilled with ${val}`)
		})
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Fulfilled with a string.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		So, with the <var>async</var> keyword, we can obtain values in the
		event the promise is fulfilled. What if the promise is rejected? We can
		do so by throwing a result, using the
		<var><mark>throw</mark></var> keyword. For example, suppose we wrote an
		async function where the argument passed must be a multiple of three:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		async function f(arg) {
			if (arg % 3 != 0) {
				throw 'Not a multiple of three.';
			}
			return 'Multiple of three.';
		}
		f(3)
			.then((val) => {console.log(`Promise fulfilled with: ${val}`)})
			.catch((val) => {console.log(`Promise rejected with: ${val}`)});
		f(5)
			.then((val) => {console.log(`Promise fulfilled with: ${val}`)})
			.catch((val) => {console.log(`Promise rejected with: ${val}`)});
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Promise fulfilled with: Multiple of three.
		Promised rejected with: Not a multiple of three.
	</code></pre>

	<section id="await">
		<h3>The <var>await</var> Keyword</h3>
		<p>
			Where async functions get very interesting is when we use them
			alongside the <var><mark>await</mark></var> keyword. When the
			<var>await</var> keyword is used inside an <var>async</var> function,
			the JavaScript engine will pause the execution of the function and
			continue only if the promise is resolved.
		</p>
		<p>To illustrate, recall how we would usually fetch data:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const resp = fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/planets').then((response) => {
				response.json().then((data) => {
					console.log(data);
				});
			})
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			{count: 60, next: 'https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2', previous: null, results: Array(10)}
			count: 60
			next: "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?page=2"
			previous: null
			results: (10) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]
			[[Prototype]]: Object
		</code></pre>
		<p>Or, alternatively, with the Axios library:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function getData() {
				return axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');
			}
			getData().then((resp) => {console.log(resp.data)});
		</code></pre>
		<p>The same behavior can be written as:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			async function getData() {
				const resp = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');
				console.log(resp.data);
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			As always, we want to address the situation where the request fails.
			One way to do so is by calling <var>.catch()</var>:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			async function getData() {
				const data = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');
				console.log(resp.data)
			}
			getData().catch((err) => {
				console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
			})
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Alternatively, we can write a <i>try-catch block</i> within the async
			function:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			async function getData() {
				try {
					const resp = await axios.get('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');
					console.log(resp.data);
				} catch (err) {
					console.log(`Error: ${err}`)
				}
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>The <var>await</var> keyword allows us to obtain data easily:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			async function getData(url) {
				const response = await fetch(url);
				return response.json();
			}

			const data = await getData('https://swapi.dev/api/planets');

			console.log({ data });
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			{data: {…}}

				count: 60

		<h3>Parallel vs. Sequential Awaits</h3>
		<p>
			As stated earlier, the <var>await</var> keyword tells JavaScript to
			pause executing the awaited function, continuing only if the promise
			is resolved. This leads to a distinction between
			<i>parallel awaits</i> and <i>sequential awaits</i>. For example,
			consider the following code:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function greet(greeting, delay) {
				return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
					setTimeout(() => {
						console.log(greeting);
						resolve();
					}, delay);
				});
			}

			async function f() {
				await greet('hi', 1000);
				await greet('yikes', 1000);
				await greet('bye', 1000);
			};

			f();
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			hi
			yikes
			bye
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			If we ran the code above, we would see the outputs <var>'hi'</var>,
			<var>'yikes'</var>, and <var>'bye'</var> one after another, ${1}$
			second apart. This is because each <var>greet()</var> executes only
			after the previous <var>greet()</var> has executed. Again, remember
			that JavaScript is synchronous. We don't get to the next function
			until the current function completes. In this case, the first
			<var>greet()</var> doesn't complete until its promise is resolved
			(per the <var>await</var> keyword), so the second
			<var>greet()</var> must wait. The same goes for the third
			<var>greet()</var>.
		</p>
		<p>Now, if we instead wrote:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function greet(greeting, delay) {
				return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
					setTimeout(() => {
						console.log(greeting);
						resolve();
					}, delay);
				});
			}

			async function f() {
				const x = greet('hi', 1000);
				const y = greet('yikes', 1000);
				const z = greet('bye', 1000);

				await x;
				await y;
				await z;
			};

			f();
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			hi
			yikes
			bye
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			we get the same result, but the outputs occur <em>all at once</em>.
			This is because each of <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var>
			<i>wait in parallel</i>. This is a particularly important point to
			keep in mind when we use <var>await</var> for HTTP requests. If we're
			making requests to different APIs, or to different data sets within
			the API that don't require waiting for an earlier response, having
			sequential awaits leads to unnecessary delays.
		</p>
		<section id="all_keyword">
			<h4><var>Promise.all()</var></h4>
			<p>In the earlier code example, we wrote:</p>
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
				function greet(greeting, delay) {
					return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
						setTimeout(() => {
							console.log(greeting);
							resolve();
						}, delay);
					});
				}
	
				async function f() {
					const x = greet('hi', 1000);
					const y = greet('yikes', 1000);
					const z = greet('bye', 1000);
	
					await x;
					await y;
					await z;
				};
	
				f();
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				Because of how common this pattern is &mdash; parallel awaits
				&mdash; JavaScript provides
				<var><mark>Promise.all()</mark></var> to express the same
				instruction in much shorter syntax. The
				<var>Promise.all()</var> method takes an array of promises. Since <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> are all promises, we can pass them as arguments:
			</p>
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
				function greet(greeting, delay) {
					return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
						setTimeout(() => {
							console.log(greeting);
							resolve();
						}, delay);
					});
				}
	
				async function f() {
					const x = greet('hi', 1000);
					const y = greet('yikes', 1000);
					const z = greet('bye', 1000);

					const results = await Promise.all([x, y, z]);
				};
	
				f();
