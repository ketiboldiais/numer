<h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>
<section id="variables_introduction">
	<p>
		Unlike many other programming languages (e.g., Java), JavaScript variables
		and constants are <span class="term">untyped</span>&mdash;we do not specify
		the type of the value to be assigned in a declaration.
		<span class="term">Variables</span> are essentially boxes with labels, that
		we can then use to store data. By storing data in a variable, we can recall
		the data later on, use it, or change it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As aforementioned, there are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript:
		<span class="monoText">let</span>, <span class="monoText">const</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">var</span>. We cover each of their uses below. To do
		so, however, we need to give the variable a <span class="term">name</span>.

	<h2>Naming Variables</h2>
	<p>
		There are a few rules that
		should always be followed when naming variables: (1) Variable names should
		be concise, descriptive, and balanced between being concise and descriptive.
		(2) The first character in a variable name should be a letter. (3) Do not
		use reserved words. (4) camelCasing, PascalCasing, or pothole_casing should
		be used for variables of multiple words. In particular: (a) Functions and
		methods generally follow camelCasing. (b) Classes and components generally
		follow PascalCasing. (c) Private variables, functions, and methods are
		generally prefixed with an underscore. (d) Constants are uppercased. (e)
		Variables <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> be named with
		kebab-casing (dashes for spaces), but JavaScript files can. For Boolean
		variables or functions, use of quantifiers is helpful:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		const isVisible = true;
		const isSubmitted = true;
		const hasEncryption = true;
		const form_is_filled = true;
	</code></pre>

	<h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
	<p>
		There are three ways to declare variables in JavaScript: using
		<span class="monoText">var</span>, <span class="monoText">let</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">const</span>. Using
		<span class="monoText">let</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		let x = 0;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Once a variable is declared with <span class="monoText">let</span>, it
		cannot then be <span class="italicsText">redeclared</span> later down the
		program:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		let x = 0;
		
		// This returns an uncaught syntax error
		let x = 1;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		However, a variable declared with <span class="monoText">let</span> can be
		<span class="italicsText">reassigned</span> a value:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		let x = 0;
		x = x + 1;
		console.log(x)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		1
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		From these rules, we can see that <span class="monoText">let</span> is
		JavaScript's way of providing <span class="term">mutable variables</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, we can declare a variable with
		<span class="monoText">const</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript">
		<code>
			const acceleration = 9.807;
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		As the name suggests, a variable declared with
		<span class="monoText">const</span> is a constant &mdash; it cannot be
		reassigned values. Thus, <span class="monoText">const</span> is JavaScript's
		way of providing <span class="term">mutable variables</span>. Moreover, a
		variable declared with <span class="monoText">const</span> must always be
		<span class="italicsText">initialized</span>. In other words, we
		<span class="underlineText">cannot</span> simply declare a
		<span class="monoText">const</span>; it must always be assigned an initial
		value.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript">
		<code>
			const acceleration = 9.807;
			
			acceleration += 1; // returns an error

			const velocity; // returns an error
		</code>
	</pre>
	<p>
		<span class="marginnote"
			>We will see in later sections why mutability can become very tedious and
			confusing. Simply put, allowing code elsewhere to modify a variable's
			assigned value can affect code relying on the variable's previous value. A
			hallmark of object-oriented programming is meticulously keeping track of
			mutable values.</span
		>
		When should we use <span class="monoText">const</span> or
		<span class="monoText">let</span>? It depends on what the value is being
		used for. If we know a particular value will be reused extensively
		throughout the code or we want an immutable value,
		<span class="monoText">const</span> should always be used. Otherwise, we can
		use <span class="monoText">let</span>. In general, mutability should be
		minimized whenever possible, as it reduces the number of values we have to
		keep track of.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic"><span class="monoText">var</span>.</span>
		<span class="monoText">var</span> was JavaScript's original way of declaring
		variables. Like <span class="monoText">let</span>, variables declared with
		<span class="monoText">var</span> are mutable variables.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript">
		<code>
			var mass = 4.5;
			mass += 1;
			console.log(mass);
		</code>
	</pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		5.5
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Using <span class="monoText">var</span> is generally discouraged. We will
		refrain from delving into the details for now, but
		<span class="monoText">var</span> is
		<span class="term">function-scoped</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">let</span> is <span class="term">block-scoped</span>.
		The issues this distinction causes will be explored in subsequent materials
		on functions.
