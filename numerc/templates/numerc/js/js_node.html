		<u>I</u>n this section, we examine Node.js. As we know, JavaScript is
		predominantly run on a browser, through some JavaScript engine, e.g.,
		Google's V8 engine or SpiderMonkey on Firefox. Below is a brief
		timeline of some of the major developments that have occurred in
		JavaScript's history.
	</p>
	<div id="node_timeline"></div>
	<p>
		Node.js is a JavaScript <i>runtime</i>, or <i>environment</i>. It's not
		a programming language, and it's not a framework. Node.js is just one
		of several environments that JavaScript can run in. The other, as we
		know, is the browser. When we load a JavaScript file in a browser, the
		source code is sent to the relevant JavaScript engine, for example, V8.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once inside V8, the source code is parsed and eventually executed. If
		V8 encounters something that doesn't look like JavaScript &mdash; e.g.,
		a local system file, DNS, network, child processes, pipes, and so on
		&mdash; it communicates with a software library called <b>libuv</b> (<q
			>lib you vee</q
		>). The libuv library is a C library that provides asynchronous input
		and output, based on event loops. This is where Node.js comes in
		&mdash; it provides a way for the V8 engine to communciate between with
		the libuv library and vice versa.
	</p>
	<p>
		Node.js's creator, Ryan Dahl, effectively created bindings that allow
		the V8 engine to communicate with the libuv libary. With these
		bindings, the V8 engine can perform OS operations, something that,
		before Node.js, wasn't possible.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="node_repl">
	<h2>Node.js REPL</h2>
	<p>
		Node.js provides a REPL &mdash; a local environment to read and execute
		JavaScript. For example, entering the
		<var><mark>node</mark></var> command and writing the following:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-3"><code>
		node
		> "hello" + " world"
		'hello world'
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		REPL stands for <q>read-evaluate-print-loop</q>, and it's exactly what
		it sounds like. The runtime will continue until we enter
		<var>CMD-C</var> or <var>CMD-Z</var> (or whatever command we've
		designated) to terminate the loop. We won't use the REPL very often,
		but it comes in handy when we need a quick test.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="executing_node">
	<h2>Executing with Node.js</h2>
	<p>
		Executing JavaScript code with Node.js is straightforward. Consider the
		following JavaScript code, contained in a file called
		<var>lab1.js</var>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		console.log("Hello world!")
	</code></pre>
	<p>To execute the code above in Node, we enter in the command-line:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
		node lab1.js
		Hello world!
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We can also load files into the REPL. For example, suppose
		<var>lab1.js</var> now contains the following:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		const parity = (num) => {
			if (num % 2 === 0) {
				console.log(`${num} is even.`);
			} else {
				console.log(`${num} is odd.`);
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Back in the command-line, we can load this file in the REPL with the
		<var><mark>.load</mark></var> command:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-6"><code>
		node
		> .load lab1.js
		> parity(8)
		8 is even 
		> parity(337)
		337 is odd
	</code></pre>

	<section id="global_object">
		<h3>Node API</h3>
		<p>
			Just as the browser provides a global <var>Window</var> object,
			Node.js also has several global environment objects as part of its
			API.<sup></sup> The chart below presents a comparison between the
			browser's API and the Node API:
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				<q>Application Programming Interface.</q> A set of features &mdash;
				e.g., constants, variables, and functions &mdash; provided by an
				application for the user to use.
			</p>
		</div>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Browser</th>
				<th>Node</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>window</td>
					<td>global</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>document</td>
					<td>process</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>history</td>
					<td>module</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>location</td>
					<td>__filename</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>navigator</td>
					<td>require()</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			We'll examine several Node objects and methods as we continue. The
			first object we'll consider is <var><mark>process</mark></var
			>, which provides details and methods of controlling Node's execution
			of the current program. We can see all these properties and methods
			by running the REPL and entering <var>process</var>. Towards the
			bottom of this long list, we see a property called
			<var><mark>argv</mark></var
			>:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			argv: [ '/usr/local/bin/node' ],
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			If we go to
			<a
				href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#processargv"
				target="_blank"
				>Node's <var>argv</var> documentation</a
			>
			we see that <var>argv</var> is an array of command-line arguments. In
			our <var>lab1.js</var> file, let's write:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const userName = process.argv[2];
			console.log(`Hello ${userName}`);
		</code></pre>
		<p>In the command-line:</p>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
			node lab1.js Bill
			Hello Bill
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This illustrates that Node can take command-line arguments, following
			<var>argv</var>'s syntax:
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>process.argv[${i}$]</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Where ${i}$ is some natural number. If ${i = 0,}$ the path to
						Node is returned. If ${i = 1,}$ the path to the current source
						code file is returned. For ${i > 1,}$ the string passed after
						the source code file name is returned.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			Through libuv library, Node can read and write system files. This
			effectively opens a whole new world for JavaScript. We have access to
			local system file paths, as well as more complicated features like
			encrypting data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Node also provides methods for sending HTTP requests through our
			local system. This effectively transfers the task of making HTTP
			requests from V8 to the operating system. Given JavaScript's emphasis
			on asynchronous programming, this feature allows us to run our
			JavaScript code through V8 without having to wait for HTTP responses,
			since the local system is handling that for us. This is called
			<b>asynchronous I/O</b>, and it's what Node is best at.
		</p>
		<p>
			To get a taste for how all of this works, let's take a look at some
			of the code beneath the hood. We'll use the
			<var>fs.open()</var> method, which allows us to open local files with
			node. This method has the following syntax:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>
				fs.open(<i>path</i> [<i>flags</i>, [<i>mode</i>]], <i>callback</i>)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This method is implemented in the
			<a
				href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/fs.js"
				target="_blank"
				>fs.js</a
			>
			file in Node's implementation. Searching for the
			<var>open()</var> function, we see the following code:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function open(path, flags, mode, callback) {
				path = getValidatedPath(path);
				if (arguments.length &lt; 3) {
					callback = flags;
					flags = 'r';
					mode = 0o666;
				} else if (typeof mode === 'function') {
					callback = mode;
					mode = 0o666;
				} else {
					mode = parseFileMode(mode, 'mode', 0o666);
				}
				const flagsNumber = stringToFlags(flags);
				callback = makeCallback(callback);
			
				const req = new FSReqCallback();
				req.oncomplete = callback;
			
				binding.open(pathModule.toNamespacedPath(path),
										 flagsNumber,
										 mode,
										 req);
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This is standard JavaScript code. We see the parameters provided by
			the API, followed by several branches and guard clauses. At the very
			end of this code, however, we see the call <var>binding.open()</var>.
			Towards the top of <var>fs.js</var>, we see that
			<var>binding</var> is some constant, bound to the result of calling
			<var>internalBinding('fs')</var>.
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const binding = internalBinding('fs');
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This is where we see those internal bindings mentioned earlier. When
			we make the call <var>fs.open()</var>, we implicitly make the call
			<var>binding.open()</var>, which then makes a call to Node's internal
			bindings. The internal bindings are found in the Node repository's
			<a
				href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/54819f08e0c469528901d81a9cee546ea518a5c3/src"
				target="_blank"
				><var>src</var> directory</a
			>, and for <var>binding.open()</var>, the
			<a
				href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/54819f08e0c469528901d81a9cee546ea518a5c3/src/node_file.cc"
				target="_blank"
				><var>node_file.cc</var></a
			>
			source code file specifically. From the extension, we can see that
			this is a ${\textsf{C++}}$ file. Towards the bottom of this file, we
			see the following ${\textsf{C++}}$ code:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
			void Initialize(Local&lt;Object&gt; target,
				Local&lt;Value&gt; unused,
				Local&lt;Context&gt; context,
				void* priv) {
			Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(context);
			Isolate* isolate = env->isolate();
			BindingData* const binding_data =
			env->AddBindingData&lt;BindingData&gt;(context, target);
			if (binding_data == nullptr) return;

			env->SetMethod(target, "access", Access);
			env->SetMethod(target, "close", Close);
			env->SetMethod(target, "open", Open);
			env->SetMethod(target, "openFileHandle", OpenFileHandle);
			env->SetMethod(target, "read", Read);
			env->SetMethod(target, "readBuffers", ReadBuffers);
			&vellip;
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The lines starting with <var>env->SetMethod()</var> are
			<i>pointer dereferences</i>. There's some pointer called
			<var>env</var> that points to another dereferenced pointer
			<var>binding_data->env()</var>. These pointers, working together, tie
			JavaScript syntax with ${\textsf{C++}}$ code to form mappings. And it
			is these mappings that make up Node's internal bindings interface.
			Above, we see that one of these mappings is
			<var>env->SetMethod(target, "open", Open);</var>. This tells us that
			the JavaScript <var>"open"</var> is tied to some function
			<var>Open</var>. And if we look for this function in
			<var>node_file.cc</var>, we see the following:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
			static void Open(const FunctionCallbackInfo&lt;Value&gt;& args) {
				Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);
			
				const int argc = args.Length();
				CHECK_GE(argc, 3);
			
				BufferValue path(env->isolate(), args[0]);
				CHECK_NOT_NULL(*path);
			
				CHECK(args[1]->IsInt32());
				const int flags = args[1].As&lt;Int32&gt;()->Value();
			
				CHECK(args[2]->IsInt32());
				const int mode = args[2].As&lt;Int32&gt;()->Value();
			
				FSReqBase* req_wrap_async = GetReqWrap(args, 3);
				if (req_wrap_async != nullptr) {  // open(path, flags, mode, req)
					req_wrap_async->set_is_plain_open(true);
					AsyncCall(env, req_wrap_async, args, "open", UTF8, AfterInteger,
										uv_fs_open, *path, flags, mode);
				} else {  // open(path, flags, mode, undefined, ctx)
					CHECK_EQ(argc, 5);
					FSReqWrapSync req_wrap_sync;
					FS_SYNC_TRACE_BEGIN(open);
					int result = SyncCall(env, args[4], &req_wrap_sync, "open",
																uv_fs_open, *path, flags, mode);
					FS_SYNC_TRACE_END(open);
					if (result >= 0) env->AddUnmanagedFd(result);
					args.GetReturnValue().Set(result);
				}
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Looking at this code, we see that the <var>Open()</var> function
			first creates a pointer to the arguments passed into the function. We
			then have some guard clauses, followed by variable initializations
			for the <var>flags</var> and <var>mode</var>. More importantly,
			however, are the two function calls towards the end:
			<var>AsyncCall()</var> and <var>SyncCall()</var>. Both of these
			functions contain two arguments, <var>uv_fs_open</var>.<sup
			></sup> These are, in fact, libuv functions. This illustrates that
			the call to <var>uv_fs_open</var> can be synchronous or asynchronous.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Studying Node.js's implementation, it turns out that wherever we
				see <var>uv_</var>, it's more than likely a call to something in
				the libuv library.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			So what does <var>uv_fs_open</var> look like? Well, we can go to the
			<a
				href="https://github.com/libuv/libuv/tree/v1.x/src"
				target="_blank"
				>libuv Repository's <var>src</var> directory</a
			>
			for more information. Inside the <var>src</var> directory, we see two
			subdirectories, <var>unix</var> and <var>win</var>. These directories
			contain code for particular operating systems (in this case, Unix and
			Windows). We see this distinction because Windows and Unix operating
			sytems take different approaches for organizing and presenting system
			files. Let's look inside the Unix directory. There, we see a file
			called <var>fs.c</var>. This is the other end of Node's internal
			bindings. Inside this file, we see some standard C code.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we look for <var>uv_fs_open</var>, we see the following function
			definition:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-c"><code>
			int uv_fs_open(uv_loop_t* loop,
										 uv_fs_t* req,
										 const char* path,
										 int flags,
										 int mode,
										 uv_fs_cb cb) {
				INIT(OPEN);
				PATH;
				req->flags = flags;
				req->mode = mode;
				POST;
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			From this code, we can determine that <var>uv_fs_open()</var> returns
			an <var>int</var> value, and takes some pointer and literal values as
			arguments. The very last line, <var>POST</var>, is a macro function,
			and we can see its definition is:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-c"><code>
			#define POST                                                                  \
				do {                                                                        \

		<p>
			Examining this code, we see a guard clause, checking if some pointer
			<var>cb</var> is null pointer. If it isn't, then we register the
			call, followed by a call to <var>uv__work_submit()</var>. This is
			where the brunt of the work is performed. One of the arguments passed
			is <var>uv__fs_work</var>, a static function defined as follows:

		<p>
			This is the actual function that opens the file. As we can see,
			implementing Node is a massive undertaking, and we owe immense
			gratitude to Node's contributing developers. All of this code is
			abstracted away as Node's API, and we don't have to think about any
			of these implementation details.

	<h2>Backend v. Frontend</h2>
	<p>
		In web development, Node.js is categorized as a backend technology.
		This is in contrast to a frontend technologies like React or Vue.js.
		The distinction between backend and frontend stems from the
		<b>client-server model</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under the client-server model, software systems &mdash; e.g., some web
		application like Netflix, Twitter, Facebook, and so on &mdash; consists
		of two primary components: a <b>client</b> and a <b>server</b>. A
		client is some system that consumes the web application's services. For
		example, the browser on our desktop or mobile phone. The server is some
		system that delivers those services to the client. It might be a server
		somewhere far from where we currently are, or it might be nearby.
	</p>
	<p>
		To illustrate, consider online banking through some bank's website.
		Let's call the bank <i>Kaching</i>. Our friend Yumiko is a Kaching
		user, and she wants to transfer some money from her savings to her
		checking account. Rather than go to the bank, Yumiko can do it all
		online through Kaching's website. So Yumiko gets on Chrome, and enters
		Kaching's URL. When she hits enter, the browser sends a
		<i>request</i> to some server that stores all of the data that make up
		Kaching's website.
	</p>
	<p>
		After receiving this request, the server sends a <i>response</i> to
		Yumiko's Chrome browser. That data might include
		<i>static files</i> &mdash; JavaScript files for animations and form
		controls, HTML files for the actual structure, CSS files for styling
		banners, buttons, and headers, and so on. The technologies used to
		design and implement these files &mdash; the components that are
		actually shown to the user &mdash; are frontend technologies. In
		contrast, backend technologies are the technologies used to control how
		and when the frontend components. These technologies include Node,
		Django, Go, Ruby, and many others.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why not just keep all of these technologies in the same place? Well,
		for starters, backend technologies perform operations that we simply
		can't perform on the client side. For example, validating whether a
		user entered a unique username when they first sign up for a service
		requires the software system to determine if the username is taken. We
		can't give everyone a copy of the database of all usernames.

	<h2>Review of Asynchronous Code</h2>
	<p>
		Because Node is an asynchronous JavaScript environment, it's worth
		quickly reviewing the concept of asynchronous programming. Consider the
		following code:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		function timeStamp() {
			const time = Date.now();
			const a = (time / 1000);
			const b = Math.trunc(a);
			return (a - b).toFixed(3); 
		}
		function f() {
			const time = timeStamp();
			console.log(`${time}: f() executed`)
		}
		
		function g() {
			const time = timeStamp();
			console.log(`${time}: g() executed`)
		}
		
		console.log(timeStamp());

		f();

		console.log(timeStamp());

		g();

		console.log(timeStamp());
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		0.094
		0.125: f() executed
		0.126
		0.126: g() executed
		0.126
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Examining the output, we can see that <var>f()</var> executes first,
		followed by <var>g()</var>. This is apparent given the timestamps.
		<var>f()</var> executes at point <var>0.172</var>, and
		<var>g()</var> executes at point <var>0.206</var>. This follows
		JavaScript's default <i>synchronous</i> execution sequence. The
		function <var>f()</var> is called a <b>blocking function</b> &mdash; it
		prevents <var>g()</var> from executing.
	</p>
	<p>Now consider this output:</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
		function timeStamp() {
			const time = Date.now();
			const a = (time / 1000);
			const b = Math.trunc(a);
			return (a - b).toFixed(3); 
		}
		function f() {
			const time = timeStamp();
			console.log(`${time}: f() executed`)
		}
		function g() {
			const time = timeStamp();
			console.log(`${time}: g() executed`)
		}
		
		console.log(timeStamp());

		setTimeout(() => {
			f();
		}, 1000);

		console.log(timeStamp());

		g();

		console.log(timeStamp());
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		0.975
		0.985
		0.986: g() executed
		0.986
		0.989: f() executed
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now we see that <var>f()</var> executes after <var>g()</var>, even
		though <var>f()</var> came first. When we call <var>setTimeout()</var>,
		JavaScript doesn't wait for the time to finish. It proceeds to
		<var>g()</var>. Once the timer finishes, control goes back to
		<var>f()</var>. Because of this phenomenon, we say that
		<var>f()</var> is now a <b>non-blocking function</b> &mdash; it does
		not prevent <var>g()</var> from executing.
	</p>
	<p>
		Asynchronous processes are not unique to JavaScript &mdash; our
		computer's CPU itself relies on them. When we send an HTTP request for
		a website or play a video game on our computer, the CPU isn't
		necessarily doing all of this work. Instead, it delegates the necessary
		responsibilities to other components in our computer system &mdash; the
		graphics card, the network card, the sound card, and so on. In short,
		the CPU doesn't perform these responsibilities one after another. If
		that were the case, we wouldn't see students browsing Reddit with One
		Note open to the side during lecture. Importantly, the delegated
		responsibilities are handled by <i>asynchronous processes</i>. That is,
		when the network card is working on something, it doesn't prevent the
		graphics card from doing its work.
	</p>
	<p>
		The same idea extends to asynchronous JavaScript. Many processes take
		time to complete. For example, calling some function <var>f()</var> to
		send an HTTP request and retrieve a large amount of data can take a
		very long time. Chances are, we have more functions after
		<var>f()</var> that do not need to wait for <var>f()</var> to finish.
		Because of this fact, we do not want <var>f()</var> to be a blocking
		function. Waiting when we don't have can lead to poor software,
		security issues, and bugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, how does Node execute asynchronous code? To answer this
		question, let's think about <i>processes</i> more generally. Suppose we
		wrote a synchronous program called <var>main.js</var>, to be executed
		in Node. It consists of just two functions, <var>f()</var> and
		<var>g()</var>. When we tell the computer to run <var>main.js</var>,
		the instructions make their way to the CPU, and the CPU begins
		performing the computations. The instructions could be a loop,
		addition, division, indexing into an array, all of the usual things we
		have the computer perform. The CPU's execution of these computations
		begins a <b>process</b>. This is effectively a container of all the
		resources used for the computation &mdash; memory pages (the current
		view of memory), file descriptors (e.g., what sockets are open),
		security credentials (e.g., permissions to execute a particular
		instruction), and so on:
	</p>
	<div id="process_demo"></div>
	<p>
		Now, the computations the CPU must perform involve instructions and
		data, comprised of bits. For the CPU to operate on the instructions and
		data, it must store these bits in its processor registers at various
		points in time. A <b>thread</b> is the set of all these bits &mdash; in
		our case, dedicated to <var>main.js</var> &mdash; that occupy these
		registers. Thus, for the synchronous <var>main.js</var>, execution
		results in creating a single thread:
	</p>
	<div id="process_demo1"></div>
	<p>
		As we said earlier, <var>thread1</var> is the set of all the bits the
		CPU needs to execute <var>main.js</var>. This set changes as the CPU
		executes each instruction. Some bits are moved from one register to
		another, others are saved where they are, and yet others are destroyed.
		To keep track of all this activity, each thread uses a special CPU
		register called the <b>program counter</b> (which keeps track of what
		instructions to execute next) and a <b>stack pointer</b> (which keeps
		track of where in memory <var>main.js</var>'s instructions are kept).
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, each of <var>main.js</var>'s instructions are stored in
		designated areas of memory. To manage that memory, the computer system
		uses a stack data structure called a <b>call stack</b>. The call stack
		is comprised of frames, and each function in <var>main.js</var> gets
		its own stack frame. Thus, because <var>main.js</var> consists of two
		functions <var>f()</var> and <var>g()</var>, <var>main.js</var>'s
		allocated region of instruction memory wil result in a call stack of
		two stack frames. When <var>f()</var> finishes executing, its
		instructions are popped off the stack. When <var>g()</var> is called, a
		new stack frame is loaded, and when that finishes, <var>g()</var> is
		popped off the stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		From this discussion, it follows that each thread has an accompanying
		call stack:
	</p>
	<div id="process_demo2"></div>
	<p>
		What if <var>f()</var> and <var>g()</var> were asynchronous HTTP
		requests? Well, this is where the libuv library comes in. The libuv
		library has instructions for setting up a <b>thread pool</b> of four
		threads. A thread pool is a group of threads &mdash; a collection of
		bits &mdash; available for usage. These bits comprise OS- and
		network-related instructions. When we make those asynchronous calls,
		libuv sends those instructions to the CPU, effectively allowing us to
		have more than one thread: <var>f()</var> gets a thread with its own
		call stack, and <var>g()</var> gets a thread with its own call stack.
	</p>
	<div id="process_demo3"></div>
	<p>
		We have to be very careful about what we're implying here. First, the
		fact that we can use a pool of threads does not imply that Node somehow
		transforms JavaScript into a language that supports full-fledged
		multithreading. JavaScript is a synchronous language, built under the
		assumption of single-threaded programs. Indeed, when we execute
		programs in Node, there's one, and only one thread, used for the
		JavaScript engine. Hence, any blocking functions we write in JavaScript
		will block.
	</p>
	<p>
		The asynchronous code we write in Node is handled by libuv's
		<b>event loop</b>. When we make an asynchronous call, Node makes a call
		to libuv:
		<q>I've got a callback here. Call me when it's ready.</q> libuv takes
		the call, and executes the instructions. Once those instructions are
		executed, it sends the results back to Node. In sum, all of our
		JavaScript code runs on the main thread, and any asynchronous I/O, such
		as file systems and networking operations, are placed on the event
		loop.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Another caveat: Not all asynchronous functions are handled by the
			thread pools. For Node, the threads in the thread pool are used
			exclusively for asynchronous I/O operations.
		</p>
	</div>

	<section id="event_loop">
		<h3>Event Loop</h3>
		<p>
			As stated earlier, the event loop is what handles all of the callback
			functions in our node program. When we execute JavaScript in Node, a
			loop is implicitly executed inside libuv. The loop looks something
			like:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
				while (!exitProcess) {
					processEvents();
				}
			</code></pre>
			<figcaption>
				A rough sketch of what the event loop looks like.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			This loop is the event loop. As long as libuv hasn't been told to
			exit the current process, libuv will continue processing events. What
			does the <var>processEvents()</var> function look like? It's
			essentially a function that processes a queue of callback functions.
			For example, suppose we wrote the following code:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function a() {console.log('a()')};
			function b() {console.log('b()')};
			function c() {console.log('c()')};
			function d() {console.log('d()')};
			function e() {console.log('e()')};

			setTimeout(() => {a()}, 1000);
			b();
			setTimeout(() => {c()}, 1000);
			d();
			setTimeout(() => {e()}, 500);
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			b()
			d()
			e()
			a()
			c()
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Above, we have five functions, three of which are callback functions.
			Functions <var>a()</var> and <var>b()</var> are called only after
			${1}$ second has passed, and function <var>e()</var> is called only
			after half a second has passed. This is why we see the output above:
			In JavaScript, functions are executed in
			<i>the order they're called</i>, <em>not</em> in the order they're
			defined.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's review how this works in the browser. JavaScript encounters the
			first <var>setTimeOut()</var>, and it provides a function to be
			called back after ${1}$ second. JavaScript sends this to a table data
			structure in the browser called the <b>event table</b>:
		</p>
		<div id="et1"></div>
		<p>
			The browser will continue to monitor this table, watching the timers.
			Next, JavaScript encounters the second function, <var>b()</var>. This
			function is placed on the call stack:
		</p>
		<div class="split">
			<div id="st1"></div>
			<div id="et2"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Once the function finishes executing, it is popped off the stack.
			Then, JavaScript encounters the second <var>setTimeout()</var>. This
			is sent to the event table.
		</p>
		<div class="split">
			<div id="st2"></div>
			<div id="et3"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			The next function encountered is <var>d()</var>, and this is pushed
			to the call stack:
		</p>
		<div class="split">
			<div id="st3"></div>
			<div id="et4"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Once <var>d()</var> finishes executing, it's popped off the call
			stack. Then JavaScript encounters the last <var>setTimeout()</var>,
			and again sends this to the event table.
		</p>
		<div class="split">
			<div id="st4"></div>
			<div id="et5"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			At this point, the stack is empty. The browser, however, has been
			keeping an eye on the timers in the event table. The first timer to
			expire is
			<var>setTimeout3</var>, so the function associated with that timer,
			<var>e()</var> is sent to a data structure called the
			<b>callback queue</b>:
		</p>
		<div id="cbqueue1"></div>
		<p>
			Then when the next <var>setTimeout()</var> expires, that function is
			added to the callback queue. In this case, the next timer to expire
			is <var>a()</var>, since <var>a()</var> went into the event table
			before <var>c()</var>. Once <var>c()</var>'s timer expires, it too is
			sent to the callback queue:
		</p>
		<div id="cbqueue2"></div>
		<p>
			The functions are then executed in the order they're dequeued &mdash;
			first in, first out:
		</p>
		<div id="stackfinal"></div>
		<p>
			So that's the browser's event loop. What about NodeJS's? The process
			is similar, with a few modifications. First, NodeJS's event loop has
			four phases:
		</p>
		<div id="eventLoopGraph"></div>
		<p>
			The first phase is to enqueue timers. There are timers in NodeJS:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<var>setTimeout(() => { ${f}$ }, ${t}$)</var> which executes the
				function ${f}$ after a time period ${t.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				<var>setInterval(() => { ${f}$ }, ${t}$)</var> which executes the
				function ${f}$ after every time period ${t.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				<var>setImmediate(() => { ${f}$ })</var> which executes ${f}$ at
				the next iteration of the event loop.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The event loop begins by checking the timers. If it sees that a
			<var>setTimeout()</var> or <var>setInterval()</var> has expired, it
			enqueues the associated callback function to the callback queue. It
			does not enqueue any function associated with
			<var>setImmediate()</var> at this phase.
		</p>
		<p>
			The event lopp then goes to the <i>I/O callback phase</i>, and checks
			if there are any callback functions to execute.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next phase is where the event loop checks the
			<var>setImmediate()</var> timers. All functions associated with
			<var>setImmediate()</var> are enqueued to the callback queue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the <var>setImmediate()</var> phase is done, the event loop goes
			to the <i>close callbacks phase</i>. This is where the event loop
			checks if there are any functions that need to be called back after a
			file or network connection is closed.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the event loop finishes this first tick, it goes back to the
			timers phase. It checks if there are any timers and enqueues
			accordingly. It then goes to the I/O callbacks phase, and checks if
			there are any functions in the I/O callback to execute. Then to the
			<var>setImmediate()</var> phase and enqueues accordingly. And finally
			to the close callbacks phase. This loop continues over and over
			again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Node's event loop approach has changed the way HTTP requests are
			handled. Before Node, HTTP requests were always blocking functions.
			This meant that if a user sent ${3}$ requests &mdash; ${r_1,}$
			${r_2,}$ and ${r_3}$ &mdash; the server ${r_1}$ blocked the
			processing of ${r_2,}$ and ${r_2}$ blocked the processing of ${r_3.}$
			To get around this problem, servers would generate new threads for
			each request. Although this model worked, it was
			<i>very</i> expensive. Any web service that entailed thousands or
			millions of requests &mdash; think Facebook, Twitter, news websites,
			etc. &mdash; would need a substantial amount of money for server
			costs.

	<h2>Modules</h2>

		Node &mdash; and JavaScript in general &mdash; has a vibrant variety of
		<b>modules</b>. In Node, we can use modules with the

		we'll use Node's HTTP module. Before we delve into the HTTP module, we

	<section id="observer_pattern">
		<h3>Observer Pattern</h3>
		<p>Consider the following code:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function Subject() {
				this.F = [];
			}
			
			Subject.prototype = {
				subscribe: function (f) { this.F.push(f) },
				unsubscribe: function (f) {
					this.F = this.F.filter(g => {
						if (g != f) { return g }
				})},
				notify: function () { this.F.forEach(f => {f.call()})}
			}
			
			const subject = new Subject();
			const a = () => { console.log('a() fired.') };
			const b = () => { console.log('b() fired.')}
			const c = () => { console.log('c() fired.')}
			
			subject.subscribe(a);
			subject.subscribe(b);
			subject.subscribe(c);
			
			subject.notify();
			
			subject.unsubscribe(b);
			
			console.log('b() unsubscribed.');
			
			subject.notify();
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			a() fired.
			b() fired.
			c() fired.
			b() unsubscribed.
			a() fired.
			c() fired.
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Let's walk through this code carefully. First, we have a function
			called <var>Subject()</var>. When we later write
			<var>new Subject()</var>, JavaScript will create a new object
			containing an array called <var>F</var>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, we assign an object to <var>Subject()</var>'s prototype. Recall
			that every object in JavaScript &mdash; and functions are objects
			&mdash; has a built-in property called <i>prototype</i>. This itself
			is an object, and we can assign it properties and methods. Thus, in
			the next block of code starting with <var>Subject.prototype</var>, we
			assign a few methods:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			{
				subscribe: [Function: subscribe],
				unsubscribe: [Function: unsubscribe],
				notify: [Function: notify]
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The <var>subscribe()</var> method takes a function <var>f</var> and
			adds it to the <var>Subject()</var>'s <var>F[]</var> array. The
			<var>unsubscribe()</var> method takes a function <var>f</var> and
			removes it from the <var>Subject()</var>'s <var>F[]</var> array. The
			<var>notify()</var> method executes all of the functions inside the
			<var>F[]</var> array.
		</p>
		<p>
			This pattern is called the <b>observer pattern</b>. The name comes
			from the fact that there's a single <i>subject</i> (in the case
			above, the constant <var>subject</var>) being listened to, or
			watched, by <i>observers</i> (each of <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and
			initially, <var>c</var>).
		</p>
		<p>
			The observer pattern is essentially an encapsulation of a common
			idiom in functional programming &mdash; a function that executes each
			function in an array of functions:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function callAll() {
				for (let i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
					arguments[i].call();
				}
			}
			
			const a = () => { console.log('a() fired') };
			const b = () => { console.log('b() fired') };
			const c = () => { console.log('c() fired') };
			
			callAll(a, b, c);
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			a() fired
			b() fired
			c() fired
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Now that we know how the observer pattern works, let's get back to
			HTTP requests.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="http_requests">
		<h3>HTTP Requests</h3>
		<p>
			To make an HTTP request in Node, we must use the
			<var>require</var> keyword, and Node's <var>HTTP</var> module:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const http = require('http');

			const req = http.request('http://www.google.com', (res) => {
				res.on('data', (chunk) => {
					console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
				})
				res.on('end', () => {
					console.log('No more data');
				});
			})

			req.end();
		</code></pre>
		<p>Let's walk through the code. First, we wrote the following line:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const http = require('http');
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The <var>require()</var> method in Node has the following syntax:
		</p>
		<figure class="block">
			<ul class="syntax">
				<li>require('<i>module</i>')</li>
			</ul>
		</figure>
		<p>Where <var>module</var> is a string value of either:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A path to a JavaScript file. E.g.,</li>
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
				require('./file.js')
			</code></pre>
			<li>a core module provided by Node. E.g.,</li>
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
				require('http')
			</code></pre>
			<li>
				Or a dependency in the local <var>node_modules</var> folder. E.g.,
			</li>
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
				require('D3')
			</code></pre>
		</ol>
		<p>
			When we call <var>require('x')</var>, Node executes <var>x</var>, or
			the contents of <var>x</var>, and returns an object called
			<var>exports</var> containing whatever we've specified in
			<var>x</var> as an export.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, when we write <var>const http = require('http')</var>, we're
			communicating to JavaScript:
			<q
				>From now on, the exports object returned from calling
				<var>require('http')</var> is identified as <var>http</var>.</q
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the <var>http</var> object, we have a variety of methods and
			properties. One of those methods is <var>request()</var>. The
			<var>request()</var> method has the following syntax:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>request(<i>url</i>, <i>options</i>, <i>callback</i>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The <var>url</var> parameter is a string value, the address of some
			web resource.<sup></sup> This parameter is followed by
			<var>options</var> and a <var>callback</var>. For now, we'll just
			focus on the <var>callback</var>.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				<q>URL</q> is an acronym of <i>Uniform Resource Locator</i>.
				Essentially, a web address.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>Using the <var>http</var> object, we make the call:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const req = http.request('http://www.google.com', (res) => {
				res.on('data', (chunk) => {
					console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
				})
				res.on('end', () => {
					console.log('No more data');
				});
			})

			req.end();
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The code's structure should ook familiar &mdash; it's the observer
			patterns. In this case, the subject is the result of calling
			<var>http.request()</var>. This result is the
			<i>HTTP response</i> &mdash; what the server sends to use when we
			send our <i>HTTP request</i> with <var>http.request()</var>. We then
			have two observers:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			(chunk) => { console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`) };
			() => { console.log('No more data') }
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			These two observers are subscribed to particular events that the
			subject &mdash; the HTTP response &mdash; communicates. If the
			response emits <var>'data'</var>, the first observer is triggered. If
			the response no longer emits <var>'data'</var> the second observer is
			triggered.
		</p>
		<p>The very last line:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			req.end();
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			is necessary to ensure that the request is sent. Otherwise, Node will
			think that we're still writing our request. If we run the code above,
			we get a massive amount of output (below is a small snippet):
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html itemscope=&quot;&quot;
			itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/WebPage&quot;
			lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;
			Search the world&apos;s information, including webpages,
			images, videos and more. Google has many special features 
			to help you find exactly what you&apos;re looking for.&quot;
			name=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;meta content=&quot;noodp&quot;
			name=&quot;robots&quot;&gt;
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This output is in fact the data that comprises the Google homepage,
			and it's what the browser uses to construct the Google homepage
			whenever we visit the URL. Running the code above in Node, we get the
			unrendered code constructing Google's homepage.
		</p>

	<section id="https">
		<h3>HTTPS Requests</h3>
		<p>
			Although Node's HTTP module works fine, for most projects, we want to
			use Node's HTTPS module. This allows us to send
			<i>HTTPS requests</i>; requests made under the more secure HTTPS
			protocol.
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const { request } = require('https');

			const req = request('https://www.google.com', (res) => {
				res.on('data', (chunk) => {
					console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
				})
				res.on('end', () => {
					console.log('No more data');
				});
			})

			req.end();
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Note some of the modifications we've made. First, we changed
			<var>require('http')</var> to <var>require('https')</var>, to tell
			Node we want the <var>https</var> module. Second, we've assigned the
			result of calling <var>require()</var> to <var>{ request }</var>.
			This destructures the result of <var>require()</var>, and tells Node
			that we only want the <var>request</var> object. By using this
			destructuring syntax, we can now call <var>request()</var> as needed
			without using dot notation. This also serves as indirect
			documentation &mdash; it communicates directly what methods and
			properties we're using from a particular module.
		</p>
		<p>
			With destructuring, we can also specify that we only want the
			<var>get</var> method. The <var>get</var> method's only task is to
			retrieve data from a server. By specifying that method, we can omit
			the <var>req.end()</var>:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const { get } = require('https');

			const req = get('https://www.google.com', (res) => {
				res.on('data', (chunk) => {
					console.log(`Data chunk: ${chunk}`);
				})
				res.on('end', () => {
					console.log('No more data');
				});
			})

	<h2>Writing Modules</h2>
	<p>
		Writing our modules is as much an art as it is a technical skill.
		Well-organized modules can be a godsend, but a poorly-written or
		disorganized module can fly like a bat out of hell, wreaking havoc on a
		project. That said, let's take a look at how modules work.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two ways to write modules in Node. One way is through the
		CommonJS approach, and the other is through the ES6 approach. Let's
		look at the CommonJS approach first.
	</p>

	<section id="common_js">
		<h3>CommonJS Modules</h3>
		<p>
			First, let's say we have the following code, written in a file called
			<var>main.js</var>.
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function sum(arrayOfData) {
				let sum = 0;
				for (let i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfData.length; i++) {
					sum += arrayOfData[i];
				}
				return sum;
			}
			
			function average(arrayOfData) {
				return sum(arrayOfData) / arrayOfData.length;
			}
			
			const dataSet = {
				set1: [1,8,0,3,5,7,8],
				set2: [2,0,9,1,8,6,8],
			}
			
			const averageSet1 = average(dataSet.set1);
			console.log(averageSet1);
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
			node main.js
			4.571428571428571
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Nothing terribly complicated here. We have a function that sums all
			the elements of an array, and a function that computes the average of
			an array of elements. Following that, we have a dataset, and some
			test code.
		</p>
		<p>
			A more modular approach is to separate the code above into modules.
			For example, we might want the <var>sum()</var> and
			<var>average()</var> functions ought to be separated into different
			files if the <var>main.js</var> file's ultimate task is to use
			<var>average()</var> and <var>sum()</var> as auxiliary functions.
			Let's make that separation:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><var>main.js</var> &mdash; our main driver.</li>
			<li>
				<var>average.js</var> &mdash; a file containing our
				<var>average()</var> function.
			</li>
			<li>
				<var>sum.js</var> &mdash; a file containing our
				<var>sum()</var> function.
			</li>
			<li><var>data.js</var> &mdash; the file containing our data.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Moreover, let's organize these files into separate directories:</p>

		<figure>
			<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
				.
				└── main
						├── main.js
						├── stats
						│   ├── sum.js
						│   └── average.js
						└── data
								└── data.js
			</code></pre>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Our project is now much more modular, but we want to be able to use
			these functions in <var>main.js</var>. To do so, we have to link all
			of these files together. This is because code contained in a file is,
			by default, private. Thus, code we've written in one file cannot see
			or read code in another file. To get around this block, we have to
			<i>export</i> and <i>import</i> code.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, because the <var>average()</var> function uses the
			<var>sum()</var> function, we want to import <var>sum()</var> in
			<var>sum.js</var> into <var>average.js</var>. So, we go to
			<var>sum.js</var>, and write the following:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function sum(arrayOfData) {
				let sum = 0;
				for (let i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfData.length; i++) {
					sum += arrayOfData[i];
				}
				return sum;
			}
			
			module.exports = {
				sum: sum,
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice the last line. In Node, every JavaScript file has a
			<var>module</var>, which is essentially an object containing various
			information about the code written in the file. One property
			contained in <var>module</var> is <var>exports</var>, which is by
			default an empty object. We can assign key-value pairs to this
			object, and import this object into other files.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an aside, there's one small improvement we can make the code
			above. Notice that the key <var>sum</var> has the same name as the
			function we want to export, <var>sum</var>. Because they're the same,
			we can simply write <var>sum</var>:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function sum(arrayOfData) {
				let sum = 0;
				for (let i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfData.length; i++) {
					sum += arrayOfData[i];
				}
				return sum;
			}
			
			module.exports = { sum }
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			With the export set up, we can go to <var>average.js</var>, and write
			the following:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const { sum } = require('./sum.js')
	
			function average(arrayOfData) {
				return sum(arrayOfData) / arrayOfData.length;
			}
	
			module.exports = { average };
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This is the same process we saw with <var>sum.js</var>. The only
			difference is we're now including an <var>require()</var> call.
			Notice further that we're using the destructing syntax to avoid
			having to write <var>sum.sum()</var>. Moreover, there's a small
			improvement we can make to the code above:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const { sum } = require('./sum')
	
			function average(arrayOfData) {
				return sum(arrayOfData) / arrayOfData.length;
			}
	
			module.exports = { average };
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			We can omit the <var>.js</var> extension in the filepath string
			value. This is because by default, Node will look for files with the
			following extensions in order: (1) <var>.js</var>, (2)
			<var>.json</var>, and (3) <var>.node</var>. Next, let's go to our
			<var>data.js</var> and perform the same export process:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const dataSet = {
				set1: [1,8,0,3,5,7,8],
				set2: [2,0,9,1,8,6,8],
			}
			
			module.exports = { dataSet }; 
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			With all of this set up, we can now import our
			<var>average()</var> function and <var>dataSet</var> into
			<var>main.js</var>. Going into the <var>main.js</var> file, we write:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const { dataSet } = require("./data/data");
			const { average } = require("./stats/average");
	
	
			const averageSet1 = average(dataSet.set1);
			console.log(averageSet1);
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
			node main.js
			4.571428571428571
		</code></pre>
	</section>

	<section id="es6_modules">
		<h3>ES6 Modules</h3>
		<p>
			The code we presented above is the CommonJS approach to writing
			modules. The ES6 approach follows the same process, but with a few
			differences in syntax. Why are there two approaches? Because before
			ES6, JavaScript didn't have specific syntax for importing and
			exporting modules. CommonJS fulfilled that need with the
			<var>require()</var> keyword and the other mechanisms we saw above.
			However, the latest specification of JavaScript &mdash; ES6 &mdash;
			now provides a native way of importing and exporting modules.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fortunately, writing ES6 modules just requires a few changes to
			syntax: First, <var>module.exports</var> is replaced with
			<i>export statements</i>, and <var>require()</var> is replaced with
			<i>import statements</i>. So, in <var>sum.js</var>, we write:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			function sum(arrayOfData) {
				let sum = 0;
				for (let i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfData.length; i++) {
					sum += arrayOfData[i];
				}
				return sum;
			}
			
			export { sum };
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice how we've replaced the previous
			<var>module.exports</var> assignment to simply <var>export</var>. We
			make the same change to <var>average.js</var>:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			import { sum } from './sum.mjs'

			function average(arrayOfData) {
				return sum(arrayOfData) / arrayOfData.length;
			}

			export { average };
		</code></pre>
		<p>and the same change to <var>data.js</var>:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const dataSet = {
				set1: [1,8,0,3,5,7,8],
				set2: [2,0,9,1,8,6,8],
			}
			
			export { dataSet };
		</code></pre>
		<p>Finally, we go into <var>main.js</var> and write:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			import { dataSet } from "./data/data";
			import { average } from "./stats/average";


			const averageSet1 = average(dataSet.set1);
			console.log(averageSet1);
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Notice the change here: We write <var>import</var>, the object we
			want imported, the <var>from</var> keyword, and the file path.
			Running the code above, we get the following error:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-4"><code>
			node main.js
			Warning: To load an ES module, set 
			"type": "module" in the package.json 
			or use the .mjs extension.
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			We're getting this error because by default, Node treats modules as
			CommonJS modules. Node maintains this treatment for backwards
			compatibility &mdash; ES6 modules are fairly recent; if we looked at
			the vast majority of Node applications, CommonJS is undoubtedly still
			common. Helpfully, Node gives us some tips. Either we make some
			changes to <var>package.json</var>, or we change our file extensions
			to <var>.mjs</var>. We'll revisit the first approach in a later
			section, but for now, let's use the second. After renaming all of our
			files to end with the <var>.mjs</var> extension, we change the import
			statements' filepaths to include the extension:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			import { dataSet } from "./data/data.mjs";
			import { average } from "./stats/average.mjs";


			const averageSet1 = average(dataSet.set1);
			console.log(averageSet1);
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
			node main.mjs
			4.571428571428571
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Now our code works. And important point to keep in mind with these
			two module approaches: We cannot mix and match CommonJS modules with
			ES6 modules. As such, whenever we're working with others, we should
			always be clear about what approach is used.

<section id="node_package_manager">
	<h2>The Node Package Manager</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>Node package</b> is a bundle of reusable code; essentially, a
		collection of modules. We can find many packages on
		<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npmjs</a>. To install
		these packages, we run the command indicated on the package's page. For
		example, a popular package for HTTPS requests is
		<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios" target="_blank">axios</a
		>. To install axios, we run the command:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash command-line"><code>
		npm i axios
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The <var>i</var> is called a <i>flag</i>, and it stands for
		<i>install</i>. Let's try this command. First, we'll create a new empty
		directory, called it <var>lab2</var>. Inside <var>lab2</var>, we have
		the same <var>main.js</var>, <var>average.js</var>, <var>sum.js</var>,
		and <var>data.js</var> files from the previous section. (Note the
		extensions; we'll be using the CommonJS import approach for the
		following illustrations). In the terminal, we'll <var>CD</var> into
		<var>lab2</var> and run the following command:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash command-line"><code>
		npm init
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This will prompt us to answer several questions. Because we don't need
		to specify anything at this point, we can hit
		<var>enter</var> repeatedly.<sup></sup> After we've answered all the
		questions, we see a file called <var>package.json</var> inside our
		<var>lab2</var> directory, with the following content:
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Alternatively, we could instead run the command
			<var>npm init -y</var> to answer <q>yes</q> for all the question.
		</p>
	</div>
	<pre class="language-javascript"><code>

	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Running <var>npm init</var>, we've now <i>packaged</i> our project. The

		Let's go over some of the fields contained in the
		<var>package.json</var>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<small>name field.</small>
		The name field in <var>package.json</var> is the name of our packaged
		project. If we plan on publishing our project &mdash; which is highly
		encouraged in the Node community &mdash; our project's name is the
		single most important field. We want to give our projects meaningful
		and unique names, alongside complying with a few rules:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Names must be less than or equal to ${24}$ characters.</li>
		<li>No uppercase letters.</li>
		<li>No non-URL-safe characters.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>and some guidances:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not use a name already given to a core Node module.</li>
		<li>
			Don't put <var>js</var> or <var>node</var> &mdash; it's redundant.
		</li>
		<li>
			Keep the name short, because it will be passed to the
			<var>require()</var> function.
		</li>
		<li>
			Check the <var>npmjs</var> to check if the name's already taken;
			it'll save a lot of heartache.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<section id="version">
		<h4>Version</h4>
		<p>
			The <var>name</var> and <var>version</var> values are used to create
			a unique identifier of our project. If we make changes to our
			package, we should make changes to the version number, following
			<i>semantic versioning</i>.

		<h3>Using Third Party Modules: Axios</h3>
		<p>
			Let's explore the Node module system a bit more. First, we'll create
			a new empty folder, called <var>lab3</var>. Inside <var>lab3</var>,
			we'll run <var>npm init -y</var>. Then, we'll install the
			<strong>axios</strong>
			library by running <var>npm i axios</var>. <strong>axios</strong> is
			a third party moduel that allows us to make HTTP requests through
			NodeJS. One of its most useful features is automatically transforming
			response data to JSON format.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using <strong>axios</strong>, we'll create a new file called
			<var>main.js</var>. We'll update our <var>package.json</var>,
			replacing <var>index.js</var> with <var>main.js</var>, and including
			a new script. We'll also get rid of the <var>test</var> script
			because we won't need it:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			"main": "main.js",
			"scripts": {
				"start": "node main.js"
			},
		</code></pre>
		<p>Inside <var>main.js</var>, we have:</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const axios = require('axios');

			axios.get('https://www.google.com')
				.then((response) => {
					console.log(response);
				});
		</code></pre>
		<p>Running our project:</p>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-10"><code>
			npm start
			> lab3@1.0.0 start
			> node main.js
			{
				status: 200,
				statusText: 'OK',
				headers: {
					date: 'Sat, 09 Apr 2022 15:51:36 GMT',
					expires: '-1',
			&vellip;
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			We're getting the data as expected, but with a bit more
			functionality. One thing we always want to do when we request data is
			to always have <i>failure branches</i> &mdash; blocks of code to
			execute if the expected output doesn't occur. For HTTPS requests, the
			<i>failure branch</i> is when we don't get a response back. With the
			<strong>axios</strong> library, we can implement a
			<i>failure branch</i> using the <var>.catch()</var> method:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const axios = require('axios');

			axios.get('https://wwww.google.com')
				.then((response) => {
					console.log(response);
				})
				.catch((err) => {
					console.log(err);
				});
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			In the code above, we included an extra <var>w</var> in the URL.
			We've also chained a call to <var>.catch()</var>. The
			<var>.catch()</var> method has the syntax:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li><i>axios instance</i>.catch((<i>error object</i>) => {</li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>code block</i></li>
			</ul>
			<li>})</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Running our program:</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			npm start
			> lab3@1.0.0 start
			> node main.js

		<h3>The node_modules Folder</h3>
		<p>
			When we run <var>npm init</var>, we see a new folder called
			<var>node_modules</var>. This is the folder that contains all of the
			packages we've installed and their accompanying modules. When we
			refer to modules with <var>require()</var>, Node goes to our
			<var>package.json</var> and looks at the
			<var>dependencies</var> property. If it sees the dependency listed,
			Node then goes to the <var>node_modules</var> folder and looks up the
			dependency.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using our installation of <strong>axios</strong> from the previous
			section, we see the following file hierarchy:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
				.
				├── node_modules
				│   ├── axios
				│   └── follow-redirect
				├── package-lock.json
				├── package.json
				└── main.js
			</code></pre>
			<figcaption>The file hierarchy</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The <strong>axios</strong> package's modules are contained in the
			<var>axios</var> folder. Thus, inside the <var>axios</var> folder, we
			see all of the package's necessary files and source code:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
				.
				└── axios
						├── dist
						├── lib
						├── CHANGELOG.md
						├── index.d.ts
						├── index.js
						├── license
						├── package.json
						├── README.md
						├── UPGRADE_GUIDE.md
						└── SECURITY.md
			</code></pre>
			<figcaption>The <var>axios</var> directory hierarchy</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			But what's that <var>follow-redirects</var> folder? This folder is
			used by the packages we've installed. If we look inside the
			<var>axios</var> folder, we see that <strong>axios</strong> also uses
			a <var>package.json</var>. Inside that <var>package.json</var>, we
			see the following code:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			"dependencies": {
				"follow-redirects": "^1.14.8"
			},
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This property indicates that <strong>axios</strong> uses the
			<strong>follow-redirects</strong> library. This is an HTTP and HTTPS
			library for following <i>redirections</i> &mdash; URLs that redirect
			visitors to another URL (for example, URL shortening services like
			<strong>bitly</strong> and <strong>tinyurl</strong>). Thus, the
			<var>node_modules</var> folder doesn't just contain our dependencies.
			It also contains the dependencies used by our dependencies, the
			dependencies used by our depedencies used by our dependencies, and so
			on. All these dependencies, however, are thrown into the
			<var>node_modules</var> folder in a flat structure. This ensures that
			we do not have duplicated packages.<sup></sup>
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				In the earliest days of Node, dependencies were saved with a nested
				approach, leading to duplicated packages. This led to a common quip
				and accompanying memetic that the <var>node_modules</var> folder
				was heavier than a black hole.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Importantly, if we push our work to Github, it's important that we
			include the <var>node_modules</var> folder in our
			<var>.gitignore</var> file to ensure it isn't tracked and pushed.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="package_lock_json">
		<h3>The Package-lock JSON File</h3>
		<p>
			Another Node-generated file of interest is the
			<var>package-lock.json</var> file. Inside that file, we see several
			properties: <var>name</var>, <var>version</var>,
			<var>lockfileVersion</var>, and many others. The
			<var>package-lock.json</var> file helps coordinate labor within a
			project team. We can think of it as a more detailed version of the
			<var>package.json</var> file. For example, it includes our
			dependencies, as well as the exact origin of those dependencies. It
			also includes the tree-structure for our dependencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we look at the dependencies properties, we see a caret symbol
			prepended to the version numbers. For example, for the
			<strong>axios</strong> package, we see:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			"packages": {
				"": {
					"name": "lab3",
					"version": "1.0.0",
					"license": "ISC",
					"dependencies": {
						"axios": "^0.26.1"
					}
				},
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The caret symbol tells Node that it's authorized to install all
			updated versions of <strong>axios</strong>, so long as it isn't a
			major version update. If the major version is less than ${1,}$ the
			minor version number is used as the major version number. This is
			because pre-${1.0}$ versions are essentially pre-releases, and are
			likely changing very often.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the <var>package-lock.json</var> file, new project team member
			can quickly join the labor force. For example, suppose ${E}$ is an
			existing team member and ${N}$ is a new team member.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				${E}$ gives ${N}$ the project's
				<var>package-lock.json</var>.
			</li>
			<li>
				${N}$ places the <var>package-lock.json</var> in their workspace
				folder ${f.}$
			</li>
			<li>${N}$ <var>CD</var>s into ${f}$.</li>
			<li>${N}$ runs the command <var>npm init</var>.</li>
			<li>
				The project and all its source code is now inside their workspace
				folder.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>NPM, NPX, & Yarn</h3>
		<p>
			As an aside, we may have seen some developers use thecommands
			<var>yarn</var> and <var>npx</var> to install packages. These
			commands all share the characteristic of handling packages, but have
			a few differences.
		</p>
		<section id="npx">
			<h4>NPX</h4>
			<p>
				NPX stands for <i>Node Package Execute</i>, and it comes with NPM
				${5.2.0}$ and above. NPX allows us to execute packages from
				<strong>npmjs</strong> without installing the packages. NPX exists
				because NPM itself doesn't actually run packages; all it does is
				manage packages &mdash; setting up and updating the
				<var>package.json</var>, searching for packages in the
				<var>package.json</var>, and removing packages from
				<var>package.json</var> when we run <var>npm uninstall</var>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="yarn">
			<h4>Yarn</h4>
			<p>
				Yarn is a NodeJS package manager built by Facebook. It's a direct
				competitor of NPM &mdash; Yarn is faster and has more features than
				NPM (e.g., a license checker). Because Yarn is a NodeJS package
				manager, much of its API has equivalents to NPM:

<section id="web_servers">
	<h2>Web Servers</h2>
	<p>
		When we type <var>facebook.com</var> and hit enter, the browser makes a
		call to a <b>DNS server</b>. The DNS server receiving the call takes
		the name &mdash; <var>https://www.facebook.com</var> &mdash; and looks
		up its matching <i>IP address</i>. We can think of the IP address as
		<var>facebook.com</var>'s actual address. Just as Sherlock Holmes lives
		on 221B Baker Street, <var>facebook.com</var> lives at, say,
		<var>157.240.17.35</var> (in fact, you can visit Facebook by typing
		these numbers into a browser's address bar directly). This address is
		what the browser uses to send requests to the server hosting Facebook.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the browser has the matching IP address, it sends either an HTTP
		or HTTPS request to the Facebook server. The server then responds with
		data. It could be JSON, XML, TXT, HTML, CSS, JS, or any other data the
		server should respond with. The key word being <i>should.</i>
	</p>

	<section id="http_requests">
		<h3>HTTP Requests</h3>
		<p>
			How a server should respond to an HTTP/HTTPS request depends on the
			server's API. The server's API determines the server's operations and
			how those operaitons should be used. For example, with Twitter, we
			might want to see a list of all our tweets. That's data that must be
			requested, and Twitter's servers have operations for receiving and
			responding to requests for that data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Node, Django, Ruby on Rails, these are all frameworks for
			implementing those operations. Each of these frameworks differ in
			language &mdash; Node in JavaScript, Django in Python, and Ruby on
			Rails in Ruby. All of them, however, communicate with the client in
			HTTP. HTTP is a protocol with special methods:
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Method</th>
				<th>Operation</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><var>GET</var></td>
					<td>Requests data from the server</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>HEAD</var></td>
					<td>
						Same <var>GET</var>, but only requests the status line and
						header section of the data requested.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>POST</var></td>
					<td>
						Sends data to the server (e.g., customer information or a file
						upload using the HTML <var>form</var> element).
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>PUT</var></td>
					<td>
						Replaces all current representations of the target resource
						with the uploaded content.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>DELETE</var></td>
					<td>
						Removes all current representations of the target resource.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>OPTIONS</var></td>
					<td>
						Describes the communication options for the target resource.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>CONNECT</var></td>
					<td>Establishes a tunnel to the server.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>TRACE</var></td>
					<td>
						Performs a message loop-back test along the connection to the
						target resource.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			All of these methods are <i>types of requests</i>. For example, if we
			want to <i>retrieve</i> data from a particular server, we send a
			<var>GET</var> request. If we want to <i>send</i> data to a
			particular serve &mdash; for example, saving a new user's
			registration information &mdash; we would send a
			<var>POST</var> request.
		</p>
		<p>
			Server APIs are built with these methods. The server API specifies
			what the server should do when it receives a particular HTTP request.
			For example, consider a social networking website. When the user
			clicks the
			<var>Followers</var> button on their profile, their browser might
			send the request:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			GET /followers
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			If the user clicks on, say, the fifth follower, the browser sends
			another request:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			GET /friends/5
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			When the user likes a post, the browser might send another request:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			POST /liked_posts {postId: 'a3dcgr83a'}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			When the user unfollows the fourth account in their array of accounts
			followed, the request might look like:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			DELETE /following/4
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			And if the user decides to change their profile picture, the request
			could be:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			PUT /profile/picture {photo: "new_pic.jpeg"}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The server's API is what specifies what the server should do when it
			receives the requests above.
		</p>
		<p>All HTTP requests have four main parts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A <b>method</b>, which specifies the kind of request made.</li>
			<li>A <b>path</b>, which specifies the targeted resource.</li>
			<li>
				If the request is to send data to the server, a <b>body</b>,
				containing the actual data. This could be plain text, or more
				commonly, JSON.
			</li>
			<li><b>Headers</b>. This is a list of the folowing properties:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Optional <b>metadata</b>. For example, the size of our request or
					authentication information.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mandatory <b>host header</b>. This header specifies which server
					the request should be sent to.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="http_responses">
		<h3>HTTP Responses</h3>
		<p>
			Just as HTTP requests have discrete parts, so, too, do HTTP
			responses:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Headers</b>. Like the HTTP request, this is a list of
				properties. It contains:
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Content-type.</b> This tells the browser what kind of data is
					being sent in the response's body.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>
				<b>Body.</b> The <var>body</var> property contains the actual data
				we requested.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Status code.</b> The status code informs the client about what
				happened to their request. Did it succeed? Fail? Why?
			</li>
		</ol>

		<section id="http_status_codes">
			<h4>HTTP Status Codes</h4>
			<p>
				One of the rules under HTTP is that its compliants must acknowledge
				situations where they fail. For example, if we send a
				<var>GET</var> request and the server doesn't respond. Because of
				this rule, we have <b>HTTP status codes</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are numerous HTTP status codes, but they fortunately follow a
				pattern:

		<h3>Sample Web Server</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we have a broad understanding of how web servers work, let's
			take a look at how we might write a web server. First, we'll be
			working in a new directory called <var>lab4-servers</var>. Inside
			that directory, we'll create a file called <var>index.js</var>. And
			inside <var>index.js</var>, we'll implement our server:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const http = require('http');

			const PORT = 3000;

			const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
				res.writeHead(200, {
					'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
				})
				res.end('Hello!');
			});

			server.listen(PORT, () => {
				console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}.`)
			});
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Let's step through this code. First, we created an instance of the
			<var>http</var> Node module. Skipping the next line for now, we then
			created a new server called <var>server</var>. This is done through
			the <var>http</var> module's <var>createServer()</var> method:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>
				<i>http_instance</i>.createServer((req, res) => {
				<i>code block</i> })
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The <var>createServer()</var> method takes a function as its
			argument. Inside that function, there are two parameters,
			<var>req</var> (short for <var>request</var>) and
			<var>res</var> (short for <var>response</var>). Both of these
			parameters are objects.<sup></sup> The <var>req</var> object is the
			client's HTTP request, and the <var>res</var> object is our server's
			HTTP response. We can use the <var>req</var> object to
			<i>read</i> information about the client's request, and the
			<var>res</var> object to <i>write</i> our response. For now, let's
			focus on the response.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>More specifically, <i>readable streams</i> of data.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Within the callback function's body, we have two calls:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><var>res.writeHead()</var></li>
			<li><var>res.end()</var></li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The <var>res.writeHead()</var> method is what we use to write our
			response's headers. Before we get to the header, however, we pass the
			literal <var>200</var>. This is the HTML status code we want sent.
			Then we have the header, which consists of just a single property:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This tells the browser that the data it will receive is plain text.
			The next call, <var>res.end()</var>, must be made on each request
			that comes into the server. This is call is what tells Node that
			we've finished writing our response.
		</p>
		<p>
			This essentially completes our simple implementation. All that's left
			to do is have the server listen to requests:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
			const PORT = 3000;


			server.listen(PORT, () => {
				console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}.`)
			})
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The <var>http</var> module's <var>listen()</var> method tells our
			server to listen for requests. But what are those arguments? In the
			real world, servers have specific domain names &mdash;
			<var>https://www.google.com</var>, <var>https://www.amazon.com</var>,
			and so on. These names would be passed to the
			<var>listen()</var> method as arguments. Our simple server, however,
			is just running locally on our machine. Accordingly, we don't have a
			domain name.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do, however, have an IP address &mdash; some string of numbers of
			the form <var>127.0.0.1</var>. This number, however, changes
			depending on the network we're connected on, and it's fairly tedious
			to remember. Fortunately, a computer system's IP address can be
			referred to with the keyword <var>localhost</var>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <var>localhost</var> itself has ports, which we can think of as
			specific holes for data to flow through. In our simple server, we
			told the server to listen for requests entering hole number
			<var>3000</var>.
