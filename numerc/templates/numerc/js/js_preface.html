<h1>Event-driven Programming: JavaScript</h1>

<section id="preface">
	<p>
		The name &#8220;JavaScript&#8221; is a product of history and
		marketing. JavaScript was originally referred to by its developers as
		&#8220;Mocha,&#8221; but because the language was created to entice
		Java developers, the marketing experts concluded that JavaScript was a
		better fit, as &#8220;script&#8221; was the word du jour for
		&#8220;easy of use.&#8221; While there are some similarities between
		Java and JavaScript, they are two completely different and unrelated
		languages&mdash;Java is to JavaScript what ham is to hamster.
	</p>
	<p>
		JavaScript is a dynamically- and weakly-typed programming language.
		Thus, unlike languages like C++ and Java, JavaScript is compiled and
		executed at runtime. Undoubtedly, that execution most commonly occurs
		as part of a webpage in a browser, but thanks to various JavaScript
		libraries, we can execute also JavaScript directly on a machine through
		a host environment. To begin understanding why JavaScript exists and
		how it works, we should talk about the internet from a very high-level
		overview.

	<h2>JavaScript & Webpages</h2>
	<p>
		From our our understanding of networks, we know the following: When a
		user types a URL into their browser's address bar and hits enter, an
		HTTP request is sent to the server hosting that webpage. That server
		then sends a response back to the browser. Let's say the the URL
		entered is to an HTML file on that server, and let's say that HTML file
		displays a small registration form for some event. When the user
		completes the fields and hits &#8220;submit&#8221;, another request is
		sent to the server. What the server does with that request depends on
		what the programmer has coded for when that particular request is
		received. The server might verify the field's contents, store the data,
		or return a new page. It's entirely up the programmer. Nevertheless,
		once it's done, the server will send a response, like a confirmation
		page (or at least it should; it would be a poor website for the submit
		button not to display any output when it's clicked).
	</p>
	<p>
		Where does JavaScript fit in this picture? JavaScript provides the
		dynamic, or reactive, nature of a webpage. It can also, however, be
		used to handle the server side code. It's most common use case,
		however, is to add more dynamic elements to a webpage. Webpages based
		purely off of HTML and CSS are generally called <b>static webpages</b>.
		We can think of static webpages as akin to PDF files (but they can be
		more sophisticated, with CSS animations, buttons, and links). The
		webpages don't exactly change their structures in response to user
		interaction. JavaScript is what transforms the static webpage into a
		<b>dynamic webpage</b>: A webpage that changes its structure and
		content depending on the user or the user's actions.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider a webpage that only displays some blog content.
		When you're in Sendai, the content is in Japanese. When you're in
		Warsaw, it's in Polish. And when you're in Nuku'alofa, it's in Tongan.
		This is an example of a dynamic webpage &mdash; one whose content
		changes depending on some external factor. In this case, the user's
		location. If instead the webpage dispalyed English wherever you went
		&mdash; nothing else &mdash; it would be accurately described as a
		static webpage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, it's not necessarily the case that JavaScript is what provides the
		language translation services for the webpage (it could be another
		language like PHP), but JavaScript is a possibility. This phenomenon of
		dynamically changing webpages is what JavaScript is used most often
		for.

	<h2>JavaScript Libraries &amp; Frameworks</h2>
	<p>
		Because of how pervasive JavaScript is in web development, JavaScript
		has one of the largest collections of libraries and frameworks, or more
		broadly,
		<b>codebases</b>. This is both a gift and a curse. For starters, when
		we work on large programs, we should always consider if a particular
		problem is already solved by an codebase. More often than not, the
		thorniest problems have existing solutions.
	</p>
	<div class="mainIdea">
		<p>
			A helpful resource for quickly finding and researching existing
			codebases is the website
			<a href="https://www.javascripting.com/" target="_blank"
				><em>JavaScripting.com</em>.</a
			>
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Although this can significantly cut down development time, it can also
		lead to unexpected, and potentially disastrous, bugs. These bugs can be
		extraordinarily difficult to exterminate. A framework for dynamically
		reordering some buttons might rely on the assumption that containers
		can overflow, but if we globally restrict containers not to overflow,
		the framework may fail or cause problems elsewhere. Worse, that
		assumption might not be explicitly stated in the codebase. It takes
		just a single line of code to violate that assumption, wreaking havoc
		on everything we've built like a bat out of hell. Accordingly, before
		using any codebase, we must always take the time to study the codebase
		thoroughly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second problem with so many codebases is relying on a codebase when
		plain JavaScript &mdash; often called
		<i>vanilla JavaScript</i> &mdash; would suffice. The most obvious
		example of this problem is using jQuery &mdash; a JavaScript framework
		intended to reduce some of the more verbose aspects of vanilla
		JavaScript. One of the more annoying aspects of JavaScript is trying to
		find solutions to a particular problem in vanilla JavaScript, only to
		find a plethora of results employing jQuery. Fortunately, with modern
		JavaScript's improvements, jQuery is slowly going away in favor of
		vanilla JavaScript. This all to say: Err on the side of using vanilla
		JavaScript whenever possible, but don't reinvent the wheel.
