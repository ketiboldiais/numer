<h1>Event-driven Programming: JavaScript</h1>

<section id="preface">
	<p>
		The name &#8220;JavaScript&#8221; is a product of history and marketing.
		JavaScript was originally referred to by its developers as
		&#8220;Mocha,&#8221; but because the language was created to entice Java
		developers, the marketing experts concluded that JavaScript was a better
		fit, as &#8220;script&#8221; was the word du jour for &#8220;easy of
		use.&#8221; While there are some similarities between Java and JavaScript,
		they are two completely different and unrelated languages&mdash;Java is to
		JavaScript what ham is to hamster.
	</p>
	<p>
		JavaScript is a dynamically- and weakly-typed programming language. Thus,
		unlike languages like C++ and Java, JavaScript is compiled and executed at
		runtime. Undoubtedly, that execution most commonly occurs as part of a
		webpage in a browser, but thanks to various JavaScript libraries, we can
		execute also JavaScript directly on a machine through a host environment. To
		begin understanding why JavaScript exists and how it works, we should talk
		about the internet from a very high-level overview.

	<h2>Networks</h2>
	<p>
		The word &#8220;internet&#8221; was used as early as 1974 as shorthand for
		&#8220;internetwork,&#8221; likely in reference to the notion of
		<span class="italicsText">interconnected</span> computer networks.
		Accordingly, to study what the internet is, we should have basic
		understanding of computer networks.
	</p>
	<p>We might have some vague understanding of a computer network:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/client_server.svg' %}"
			alt="Client-server network"
			loading="lazy"
			class="fifty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>A simple network</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The grey point in the center is the mystery. What exactly happens between
		the client (i.e., a device) and the server? Our goal is to try and reveal
		what's behind the grey point.
	</p>
	<p>
		Computer networks is a broad field, consisting of three sub-fields: (1)
		communications, (2) networks, and (3) distributed systems. Communications is
		the lowest level, providing the theory and foundations for all modern
		computer systems. It's the study of how we use signals, 1s and 0s, to
		communicate information. Communications is traditionally handled by
		electrical engineers, physicists, and chemists, as most of the applications
		at such a low level concern electronics and materials science.
	</p>
	<p>
		Networks are abstractions of communications. At this level, we focus on the
		software: How the information is represented, packaged, and transmitted; the
		rules governing information transmission; optimization and efficiency in
		constructing networking systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the highest level are distributed systems. Distributed systems is the
		study of how to create, improve, and maintain computing environments whose
		components are spread across multiple computers on a network. Such
		environments include peer-to-peer applications like uTorrent and the
		historic Limewire; massive multiplayer online games like World of War Craft
		and Guild Wars; wireless sensor networks; aircraft control systems; and
		increasingly important in the modern era, parallel computation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our predominant focus will be on networks, but we will occasionally touch on
		communications and distributed networks for a better picture of how
		everything fits together.

<section id="network_uses">
	<h2>Network Uses</h2>
	<p>
		Today, so much of our lives depends on networks. Email, wireless printers,
		streaming news, movies, video clips, messaging, transferring finances, phone
		calling, computer gaming, maps, securing information, accessing information,
		signing contracts, ordering takeout and groceries &mdash; none of this is
		possible without networks. Let's go over some of the most important use
		cases for networks.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Communication.</span> One of the most important uses for
		networks is communication. VoIP (&#8220;voice-over-IP&#8221;), video
		conferencing, instant messaging, and social networking are all examples of
		using networks for communication. A core goal in communication networks is
		achieving low latency, high speed. Communication networks close to this goal
		are often characterized as &#8220;fast&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;high-speed
		internet&#8221;). Latency and bandwidth, however, are two very different
		concepts.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="term">Bandwidth</span> is what many perceive as a network's
		&#8220;speed.&#8221; It's a measure of how much data can be transferred from
		one point in a network to another. High bandwidth, however, doesn't imply
		&#8220;high speed.&#8221; We can think of bandwidth as akin to a freeway.
		Say you're downloading a 600 Mb (Megabyte) file. If the bandwidth was, say,
		1000 Mbps (megabits per second), it would take you about 4.8 seconds to
		download the file (there are 4800 megabits in 600 megabytes). Following the
		freeway analogy, we can think of each megabit as piece of data, and at 1000
		Mbps, we have a thousand lanes open on the freeway. If there are too many
		people on the network (i.e., congestion), or the interent service provider
		places a speed limit, some of those lanes may be closed. With enough
		congestion or a cap, that 1000 Mbps could be brought down to 100Mbps, in
		which case it would take 48 seconds to download the file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Higher bandwidth, however, doesn't necessarily mean
		&#8220;high-speed.&#8221; There is always the problem of
		<span class="term">latency</span> &mdash; how much time it takes for a
		signal to travel to its destination and back. We can think of latency as how
		long it takes to get a response after stating a request. For example, you
		might be at a drive through, and there's no one in line. You get to the
		intercom, the teller greets you, and you state your order. A second goes by,
		no response. A minute goes by, no response. At 2 to 3 minutes, you're likely
		starting to get irritated. Any longer than that, and you just drive away.
		There was no one in line and you got to the intercom fine, but it wasn't
		&#8220;fast.&#8221; You sat there for quite some time! The same idea extends
		to latency.
	</p>
	<p>Viewing latency and bandwidth together, we can think of it this way:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>High latency, low bandwidth:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Frankie: &#8220;Hi Johnny.&#8221;</li>
				<li>Johnny: &#8220;... ... ... Hi ... ... ... ... Frankie.&#8221;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>High latency, high bandwidth:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Frankie: &#8220;Hi Johnny.&#8221;</li>
				<li>Johnny: &#8220;... Hi Frankie.&#8221;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Low latency, low bandwidth:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Frankie: &#8220;Hi Johnny.&#8221;</li>
				<li>Johnny: &#8220;Hi ... ... ... Frankie.&#8221;</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Low latency, high bandwidth:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Frankie: &#8220;Hi Johnny.&#8221;</li>
				<li>Johnny: &#8220;Hi Frankie.&#8221;</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Resource Sharing.</span> In addition to communication,
		networks are critical for resource sharing. The need to share resources
		traces its origins all the way back to the ancient days of mainframe
		computers, where timesharing was the norm. Today, that need continues in
		various media. At a large company office, for example, it's unlikely that
		every worker has their own printer. Instead, there are likely several
		printers in a particular location that workers can send tasks to. Resource
		sharing extends beyond the printer. Cloud-based tools like online file
		converters and video downloaders are all examples of resource sharing. As
		resources grow increasingly costly, resource-sharing is a tremendously
		cost-effective way of meeting demand.
	</p>
	<p><span class="topic">Content Delivery.</span></p>
</section>

<section id="internet">
	<h2>The Internet</h2>
	<p>
		The internet is the penultimate example of a human accomplishment from
		humble beginnings. The internet traces its origins to 1969, with a small,
		tiny network called ARPANET (The U.S. &#8220;Advanced Research Projects
		Agency Network&#8221;). Before 1970 (when ARPANET was implemented),
		communicating between computers (large, unwieldy mainframe systems at the
		time) was done with <span class="italicsText">circuit switching</span>, much
		like how telephones were connected, end to end, with wired connections.
	</p>
	<p>
		While this system worked, they were slow and easily broke down. Two actors
		fanned the flames for optimization: At the height of the Cold War, military
		officials wanted connections that could continue working in the event of a
		nuclear strike. Separately, researchers at various universities across the
		United States wanted more reliable connections for sharing data and
		computational resources.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1962, Paul Baran &mdash; a computer scientist at the Rand Corporation
		&mdash; proposed that data be broken down into smaller pieces, and sent
		along different paths to a destination. Novel as it was, critics dismissed
		Baran's idea, and it fell short of implementation. As we'll see later,
		Baran's idea now forms the underlying basis for the World Wide Web.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several years later, the director of the U.S. Department of Defense's
		Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), J.C.R. Licklider &mdash; known by
		his colleagues as &#8220;Lick&#8221; &mdash; began outlining the idea of a
		massive &#8220;Intergalactic Computer Network.&#8221; Following ARPA's
		tradition of leaving after a year or two to give others a chance at
		management, Licklider returned to academia before seeing his idea to
		fruition. Licklider, however, took care in ensuring Robert Taylor and Irvin
		Sutherland, two highly-accomplished researchers at ARPA, continued his
		vision. By December of 1969, Sutherland and Taylor established an
		experimental network connection between UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, the Stanford
		Research Institution, and the University of Utah School of Computing.
		Several months later, in July 1970, the network expanded to include MIT and
		the Rand Corporation, among others. And by March 1971, the network included
		the University of Illinois, Harvard, and several other locations, connecting
		15 computers spread from the West to the East Coast. That experimental
		network, ARPANET, would later become the internet, to which well over 10
		billion devices are now connected.
	</p>

	<h3>Wired Connections</h3>
	<p>
		In the modern era, we've gotten used to everything being wireless. This
		author fondly remembers the days of dial up. With smartphones growing more
		and more pervasive, we no longer ask if a hotel room provides in-unit
		ethernet cables. In fact, we don't even ask questions at all &mdash; we just
		assume the business provides WiFi, and if that isn't the case, that there's
		service for LTE usage.
	</p>
	<p>
		The shocker: On the internet, <span class="underlineText">most</span> data
		is <span class="underlineText">not</span> moved on a wireless connection. In
		fact, wireless connections are at the very fringe of the internet. What do
		we mean by this? Imagine the interent as akin to the Tokyo train lines.
		There are numerous stops; the wireless connection is among the very last (if
		not the last). The vast majority of data transmitted via the internet is
		moved via fiber optic cables. Wireless connections are simply too slow, too
		small, and have too little range to transmit the voluminous amounts of data
		we supply and demand.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fiber optic cables supporting the internet lay across land and sea. They
		go through the oceans, passing from country to country, and within the
		countries, pass from state to state (or provinces/prefectures/etc.), city to
		city, and so on. The data we obtain and transmit wirelessly is actually
		received from, and sent to, a tower, which is itself connected to some
		juncture along the myriad of cables.
		<label for="trains" class="margin-toggle"><sup></sup></label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="trains" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />
		<span class="marginnote">
			In the United States, one very interesting aspect of these fiber optic
			cables is that they usually run along the federal interstate highways.
			These highways themselves trace their origins to railroad lines from the
			19th Century. Why do these connections exist? It's a lot easier to
			maintain things and fix problems on large infrastructures if we use
			pre-existing paths to traverse the infrastructure.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose we're on our home WiFi network, and want to see some
		lecture notes, contained in a PDF file, from a course offered at the
		University of Adelaide in Australia. Then suppose that those notes were
		stored on a server in Australia. When click on the link to that PDF, we are
		sending a <span class="italicsText">request</span> for those notes (more on
		this later), and the server <span class="italicsText">responds</span> with
		the notes. We do not send that request or receive the response with only a
		wireless connection. That would be far, far too slow. What instead happens
		is that the request is sent from our computer to our router, then from the
		router to some closer server, then from there to a tower, then from the
		tower all the way through the fiber optic cables across land and sea to that
		server in Australia. The truly remarkable aspect of all this is that
		depending on our internet connection and how large the PDF file is, this all
		occurs in a second or less. Even more remarkable: Countries have agreed to
		how these fiber optics cables transmit data, whether they have good or bad
		diplomatic relations.
	</p>
	<p>
		How do these fiber optic cables work so quickly? Through light and glass.
		Data is transmitted across these cables in the form of light, bouncing off
		the glass from point to point. Given that light travels at the fastest speed
		known to man (roughly 300,000 kilometers per second or 186,000 miles per
		second) &mdash; it's no surprise that data transmission along the cables is
		swift.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the very edges of these fiber optic cables, there are copper-based
		connections. For example, in a large building, there is likely a wall socket
		connecting some router, or multiple routers. Each router provides a wireless
		connection for a certain area (recall how walking away from a certain area
		reduces the strength of a wireless connection). The router's connections are
		copper-based, not fiber optic. For particularly large buildings, the router
		connections might lead to some obscure closet containing a hub for all the
		routers. Behind that hub, there's likely a few slender fiber optic cables
		leading some electrical tower nearby, which itself connects to other
		junctions along the fiber optic cable network. These shorter copper-based
		connections are used primarily because copper is cheaper than glass fiber.
		However, we do not use copper for long-range connections because electrical
		signals along copper generally only have a range of 100 meters. Beyond 100
		meters, these signals begin degrading.
	</p>
	<p>
		In recent years, numerous companies have jumped in on the fiber-optic cable
		market. In various suburban areas, we might notice signs saying a particular
		company offers fiber-optic connections in the area. These companies
		essentially lay fiber-optic connections from homes (usually much smaller
		buildings, and as such, rely on slower copper connections) to a nearby
		tower. What may be perplexing is that these areas appear almost arbitrary
		&mdash; one side of the neighborhood has access to a connection, while the
		other does not. This is a result of how expensive fiber-optic connections
		are. Companies will provide these connections only if there's sufficient
		interest to warrant the cost of laying down a cable. It would be a poor
		investment to lay a fiber optic cable for a single home.
	</p>

	<h3>Wireless Connections</h3>
	<p>
		In the modern era, wireless connections are almost always our first
		connection to the internet. Wireless connections come in various forms, one
		of which is a <span class="italicsText">Wifi network</span>. In a large
		building or room, we might notice medium-sized boxes with blinking lights
		(and potentially an antenna). These are <span class="term">routers</span>,
		and they provide a Wifi connection. As mentioned earlier, these routers have
		copper based connections to some hub elsewhere. Wifi is what we use for
		short-range connections, and they primarily set up for personal use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another form of wireless connection is through a
		<span class="italicsText">mobile data network</span>. Instead of a router,
		mobile data networks are provided by large cell towers. If we've ever
		wondered why cell phone plans cost so much, one contributing factor is the
		cost of maintaining and improving the mobile data networks provided by the
		cell towers.
	</p>

	<h3>How Do Devices Communicate on the Internet?</h3>
	<p>
		We've established a broad overview of the internet's underlying
		infastructure, but now we have another question: How do devices connected to
		the internet know when to send and receive data? In other words, how do
		these devices communciate?
	</p>
	<p>
		The answer this question, we add another layer of abstraction to the
		internet: The internet is not just a physical infrastructure; it's also a
		<span class="term">communication protocol</span> &mdash; agreement as to how
		two or more entities exchange data. The
		<span class="term">Internet Protocol</span> (IP) is series of agreements
		that allow internet-connected devices to communicate. IP specifies the
		format of <span class="italicsText">IP addresses</span> &mdash; the
		identifiers, or names, for devices connected to the internet. IP has
		underwent several changes to the way IP addresses are formatted:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p><span class="monoText">192.18.21.4</span></p>
		</div>
		<figcaption>An IPv4 address</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The IP address above is an IPv4 (read &#8220;IP version 4&#8221;) address,
		formatted in
		<span class="italicsText">dotted decimal notation</span>. Under IPv4, IP
		addresses consisted of 32 bits. With 32 bits, we can generate ${2^{32},}$
		roughly 4.3 billion, unique addresses. The problem: There are now more than
		4.3 billion people on Earth, many of whom have multiple devices, not
		counting all of the devices that aren't directly used by people. Because of
		this problem, we are now on IPv6 (IPv5 was proposed but never formally
		adopted):
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p><span class="monoText">2607:f8b0:4002:801::2104</span></p>
		</div>
		<figcaption>An IPv6 address</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With IPv6, addresses went from 32 bits to 128 bits. With 128 bits, we
		generate ${2^{128}}$ unique addresses, roughly ${3.4 \times 10^{38},}$ or
		340 undecillion. This is probably big enough.
		<label for="numbers" class="margin-toggle"><sup></sup></label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="numbers" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />
		<span class="marginnote"
			>Fun aside: ${2^{32}}$ is roughly 4.3 billion, ${2^{64}}$ is about 18.4
			quintillion ${(\approx 1.8 \times 10^{19})}$, ${2^{128}}$ about 340
			undecillion ${(\approx 3.4 \times 10^{38})}$, ${2^{256}}$ is roughly 115
			quattuorvigintillion ${(\approx 1.158 \times 10^{77}),}$ ${2^{512}}$ is
			about ${1.34 \times 10^{154}}$ (Latin has its limits), ${2^{1024}}$ is
			about ${1.798 \times 10^{308},}$ and ${2^{2056}}$ is about ${8.27 \times
			10^{618}.}$</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the naming rule, IP also specifies how messages should be
		formatted when they're exchanged across the internet. We can think of this
		as akin to the local post office's rules on what we can and cannot put into
		certain boxes or envelopes. We can place whatever we want in the box or
		envelope (subject to criminal sanctions), but for the box or envelope to be
		sent, we have to follow the carrier's rules. In IP terms, that box or
		envelope is called a <span class="term">datagram</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The datagram consists of several fields. For our purposes, the three most
		important fields are the
		<span class="term">source IP address</span>,
		<span class="term">destination IP address</span>, and
		<span class="term">data field</span>. As we can guess, the the source IP
		address indicates where the datagram originates, and the destination IP
		address indicates where the datagram should arrive. The data field is where
		all of actual content we want transmitted is placed. That content could be a
		video, an image, a text file, pretty much anything that can be represented
		in 1s and 0s. IP itself doesn't care what the content is. This freedom, of
		course, comes at a price: Just as we can send and receive cat videos,
		malevolent actors can send malicious content &mdash; viruses, worms, Trojan
		horses, phishing attacks, scams, and false information.
	</p>

<section id="web_webAPI">
	<h2>The Web & Web APIs</h2>
</section>

<section id="webpages">
	<h2>JavaScript & Webpages</h2>
	<p>
		From our our understanding of networks, we know the following: When a user
		types a URL into their browser's address bar and hits enter, an HTTP request
		is sent to the server hosting that webpage. That server then sends a
		response back to the browser. Let's say the the URL entered is to an HTML
		file on that server, and let's say that HTML file displays a small
		registration form for some event. When the user completes the fields and
		hits &#8220;submit&#8221;, another request is sent to the server. What the
		server does with that request depends on what the programmer has coded for
		when that particular request is received. The server might verify the
		field's contents, store the data, or return a new page. It's entirely up the
		programmer. Nevertheless, once it's done, the server will send a response,
		like a confirmation page (or at least it should; it would be a poor website
		for the submit button not to display any output when it's clicked).
	</p>
	<p>
		Where does JavaScript fit in this picture? JavaScript provides the dynamic,
		or reactive, nature of a webpage. It can also, however, be used to handle
		the server side code. It's most common use case, however, is to add more
		dynamic elements to a webpage. Webpages based purely off of HTML and CSS are
		generally called <span class="term">static webpages</span>. We can think of
		static webpages as akin to PDF files (but they can be more sophisticated,
		with CSS animations, buttons, and links). The webpages don't exactly change
		their structures in response to user interaction. JavaScript is what
		transforms the static webpage into a
		<span class="term">dynamic webpage</span>: A webpage that changes its
		structure and content depending on the user or the user's actions.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider a webpage that only displays some blog content. When
		you're in Sendai, the content is in Japanese. When you're in Warsaw, it's in
		Polish. And when you're in Nuku'alofa, it's in Tongan. This is an example of
		a dynamic webpage &mdash; one whose content changes depending on some
		external factor. In this case, the user's location. If instead the webpage
		dispalyed English wherever you went &mdash; nothing else &mdash; it would be
		accurately described as a static webpage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, it's not necessarily the case that JavaScript is what provides the
		language translation services for the webpage (it could be another language
		like PHP), but JavaScript is a possibility. This phenomenon of dynamically
		changing webpages is what JavaScript is used most often for.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="javascript_libraries_and_frameworks">
	<h2>JavaScript Libraries &amp; Frameworks</h2>
	<p>
		Because of how pervasive JavaScript is in web development, JavaScript has
		one of the largest collections of libraries and frameworks, or more broadly,
		<span class="term">codebases</span>. This is both a gift and a curse. For
		starters, when we work on large programs, we should always consider if a
		particular problem is already solved by an codebase. More often than not,
		the thorniest problems have existing solutions.
	</p>
	<div class="mainIdea">
		<p>
			A helpful resource for quickly finding and researching existing codebases
			is the website
			<a href="https://www.javascripting.com/" target="_blank"
				><em>JavaScripting.com</em>.</a
			>
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Although this can significantly cut down development time, it can also lead
		to unexpected, and potentially disastrous, bugs. These bugs can be
		extraordinarily difficult to exterminate. A framework for dynamically
		reordering some buttons might rely on the assumption that containers can
		overflow, but if we globally restrict containers not to overflow, the
		framework may fail or cause problems elsewhere. Worse, that assumption might
		not be explicitly stated in the codebase. The resulting bug would be
		painfully difficult to find unless we understand the codebase. Accordingly,
		before using any codebase, we must always take the time to study the
		codebase thoroughly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second problem with so many codebases is relying on a codebase when
		plain JavaScript &mdash; often called
		<span class="italicsText">vanilla JavaScript</span> &mdash; would suffice.
		The most obvious example of this problem is using jQuery &mdash; a
		JavaScript framework intended to reduce some of the more verbose aspects of
		vanilla JavaScript. One of the more annoying aspects of JavaScript is trying
		to find solutions to a particular problem in vanilla JavaScript, only to
		find a plethora of results employing jQuery. Fortunately, with modern
		JavaScript's improvements, jQuery is slowly going away in favor of vanilla
		JavaScript. This all to say: Err on the side of using vanilla JavaScript
		whenever possible, but don't reinvent the wheel.
