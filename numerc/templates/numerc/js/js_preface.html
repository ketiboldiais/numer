	<h2>Web Development: JavaScript, Python, and SQL</h2>
	<p>
		The name &#8220;JavaScript&#8221; is the par excellence of marketing mayhem. JavaScript
		was originally referred to by its developers as &#8220;Mocha&#8221; (an arguably much
		better name, coffea genericism aside), but because the language was created
		to entice Java developers, the marketing experts concluded that JavaScript
		was a better fit, as &#8220;script&#8221; was the word du jour for &#8220;easy of use.&#8221; While
		there are some similarities between Java and JavaScript, they are two
		completely different and unrelated languages&mdash;Java is to JavaScript
		what ham is to hamster.

	<h3>HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
	<p>
		Most of the materials below address programming constructs. We briefly
		address <span class="monoText">HTML</span> (&#8220;Hypertext Markup
		Language&#8221;) and <span class="monoText">CSS</span> (&#8220;Cascading
		Style Sheets&#8221;), as they central languages in web development. How to
		use these languages effectively is a topic best left for
		<span class="italicsText">web design</span>, a separate field deserving of
		unique treatment. In this section, we look at a broader overview of the two
		languages, and how they relate to computer science more broadly.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="monoText">HTML</span> is a markup language. It it is not a
		programming language per se (at least if we define a programming language as
		one that is Turing complete), but it is a language nevertheless.
		<span class="monoText">HTML</span> describes the
		<span class="italicsText">structure</span> of a webpage &mdash; where
		sections, buttons, paragraphs, and other
		<span class="italicsText">elements</span> are placed.
		<span class="monoText">CSS</span>, like <span class="monoText">HTML</span>,
		is not a programming language on its own, but it provides a means for
		<span class="italicsText">styling</span>
		<span class="monoText">HTML</span> content.
	</p>
	<p>
		A very basic <span class="monoText">HTML</span> page is written as such:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-html"><code>
		&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
		&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
		&lt;head&gt;
		&#x9;&lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;/head&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;
		&#x9;&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/body&gt;
		&lt;/html&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<h3>Programming In JavaScript</h3>
	<p>
		Recall that a <span class="term">program</span> is a set of instructions
		directing a computer to perform tasks. Programs are written in a
		<span class="term">computer language</span>&mdash;a language that can be
		<span class="term">compiled</span> and understood by the computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Computer languages have <span class="term">syntax</span>, which is the set
		of rules defining how we spell, arrange, and use words, punctuation, and
		symbols. This is very much like human language, with the key difference that
		computer languages have strict contours (e.g., words and characters have
		exact and undisputed definitions), with little to no room for ambiguity (in
		that sense, computer languages are much less complex).
	</p>
	<p>
		To direct a computer to perform a task, we write
		<span class="term">statements</span>, following the relevant language's
		syntax. Statements themselves are composed of one or more
		<span class="term">expressions</span>, just as English sentences are
		composed of clauses.
	</p>
	<p>
		A program, then, is simply a collection of these statements. Within the
		collection of <span class="term">statements</span>, there are
		<span class="term">code blocks</span>. A code block is a group of statements
		intended to carry out a specific task. In JavaScript, we group statements
		together with <span class="monoText">{}</span>. For example:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-javascript">
			<code>
				{
					let x = 4;
					let y = x * 3;
					console.log(y);
				}
				// output: <span class="output">12</span>
			</code>
		</pre>
	<p>
		When we <span class="term">execute</span> the program, the JavaScript
		interpreter translates the statements into machine code, the code the
		computer actually understands.
	</p>
