	<h3>Self-Reference</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="italicsText">Self-reference</span> is an enormously critical
		aspect of modern programming languages. The idea of self-reference is what
		allows us to represent an arbitrarily large amount of information. This is
		crucial, because problems often require an analysis of the bigger,
		overarching structures &mdash; the general case, so to speak. For example,
		with what we know so far, we can create a data structure for, and perform
		computations on, the amount of rice futures a company trades. The amount of
		such rice is described as <span class="term">fixed-sized information</span>,
		and we represent it with <span class="term">fixed-size data</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem? Not all information is of fixed-size. We do not yet have the
		ability to represent all of the different grains futures the company handles
		&mdash; the company might deal with rice, wheat, corn, lentils, soy, quinoa,
		and a plethora of other products. This type of information is called
		<span class="term">arbitrarily-sized information</span> &mdash; information
		that we do not know the size of in advance. We represent such information
		with <span class="term">arbtirarily-sized data</span>.
