	<h4>Images</h4>
	<p>
		For some of the following sections, we will be using image primitives from
		DrRacket. To do so, we write the following:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		There are numerous image primitives, and we will use them as necessary. For
		example, there are image primitive for geometric shapes and text:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; draw a filled circle
		;; fill color = red
		;; radius = 10px

		(circle 10 "solid" "red")

		;; draw outlined, non-filled rectangle
		;; stroke color = blue 
		;; length x width = 30 x 60px

		(rectangle 30 60 "outline" "blue")

		;; draw text
		;; font-size = 30px
		;; color = green
		(text "hello world" 30px "green")
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Once images are made, we have several useful primitives for acting on those
		primitives:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(above (circle 10 "outline" "black")
				(rectangle 10 30 "outline" black)
				(circle 20 "outline" black))
	</code></pre>
	<p>The above outputs the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/above_image.png' %}"
			alt="above func"
			class="ten-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>Another primitive:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(overlay (circle 10 "solid" "red")
					(circle 20 "solid" "blue")
					(circle 30 "solid" "yellow")
					(circle 40 "solid" "green"))
	</code></pre>
	<p>The above outputs:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/overlay_image.png' %}"
			alt="overlay"
			class="ten-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Another useful aspect of Racket's image primitives is that we can directly
		copy an image and paste it into our source code. Most languages do not allow
		this. But, Racket is a language aimed at primarily education, so the feature
		is provided. Moreover, the feature corresponds to the principle that images
		are just expressions, and as such, have values that we can refer to and use.
