<h1>On Recursion</h1>

<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">R</span>ecursion is a method that tends to confuse
		newcomers to programming. We will reduce that confusion through practice.
		Accordingly, the brunt of this essay consists of recursive exercises, rather
		than exposition.

	<h3>Procedures and their Processes</h3>
	<p>
		In this section, we explore two different procedures aimed at performing the
		same computation. One procedure uses
		<span class="italicsText">linear recursion</span>, the other
		<span class="italicsText">iteration</span>. These processes are broadly
		referred to as <span class="italicsText">local evolutions</span> &mdash; the
		computation evolves as the procedure executes.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Linear Recursion.</span> Recall the factorial function:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${n! = n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot (n - 2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot
				1}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>This definition is equivalent to:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${n! = n \cdot [(n - 1) \cdot (n - 2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot
				1]}$
			</p>
			<p>${\phantom{n!} = n \cdot (n-1)! }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We also know that:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>1! = 1</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From this data, we can construct a procedure. To compute the factorial:
		First, check if ${n = 1.}$ If ${n = 1,}$ then return 1. Otherwise, return
		the factorial of ${n - 1.}$ This procedure employs the process of
		<span class="italicsText">linear recursion</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define (factorial n)
			(if (= n 1)
				1
				(* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We can use the substitution model to see how this procedure's computation
		evolves &mdash; suppose want to compute
		<span class="monoText">factorial 6</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			(factorial 6)
			(* 6 (factorial 5))
			(* 6 (* 5 (factorial 4)))
			(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (factorial 3))))
			(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (factorial 2)))))
			(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (factorial 1))))))
			(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))))
			(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 (* 3 2))))
			(* 6 (* 5 (* 4 6)))
			(* 6 (* 5 24))
			(* 6 120)
			720
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Another way to understand recursion is to envision the computer as a tiny
		dystopia. Inside the computer, there are millions of tiny people, and we
		dictate what jobs they must accomplish. Each person is an expert on a
		particular symbol, or part, of our program. We have experts on
		<span class="monoText">*</span>, experts on
		<span class="monoText">define</span>, experts on
		<span class="monoText">=</span>, experts on
		<span class="monoText">factorial</span>, etc. When we call
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 6)</span>, we called some person named
		Russ, who is an expert on evaluating
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 6)</span>. Now, as part of evaluating
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 6)</span>, Russ has to evaluate
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 5)</span>, but he's only an expert on
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 6)</span>, so he calls Julia, who is an
		expert on evaluating <span class="monoText">(factorial 5)</span>. As part of
		evaluating <span class="monoText">(factorial 5)</span>, Julia must evaluate
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 4)</span>, and to do that, she needs
		another expert, Obi. To evaluate
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 4)</span>, Obi must evaluate
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 3)</span>, and to do that, he has to call
		another expert, Keiko, who can evaluate
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 2)</span>. To evaluate
		<span class="monoText">(factorial 2)</span>, Keiko must call the expert on
		evaluating <span class="monoText">(factorial 1)</span>, Blaise. Blaise
		always knows the answer to <span class="monoText">(factorial 1)</span>: it's
		<span class="monoText">1</span>. Thus, Blaise hands his work product to
		Keiko, Keiko uses that work product and hands her work product to Obi, Obi
		uses that work product and hands his work product to Julia, Julia uses that
		work product to and hands her finished work to Russ, who uses that work
		product and computes <span class="monoText">(factorial 6)</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Iteration.</span> In contrast, here is a procedure
		employing the process of <span class="italicsText">iteration</span> to
		compute ${n!}$: First, multiply 1 by 2, then multiply the result by 3, then
		4, 5, 6, etc. We keep doing so until we reach ${n.}$ This is essentially
		keeping a running product, along with a counter running from 1 to ${n.}$
		Visually, the counter and the product simultaneously change from one step to
		the next:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\texttt{counter} \times \texttt{product} \implies \texttt{product}}$
			</p>
			<p>${\texttt{counter} + \texttt{1} \implies \texttt{counter}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The result of ${n!}$ then is the value of
		<span class="monoText">product</span> once
		<span class="monoText">counter > ${n.}$</span>
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define (factorial n)
			(fact-iter 1 1 n))
		(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
			(if (> counter max-count)
				product
				(fact-iter (* counter product)
								(+ counter 1)
								max-count)))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Once again, we can use the substitution model to think about how the
		computation evolves with the iterative procedure:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			(factorial 6)
			(fact-iter 1 1 6)
			(fact-iter 1 2 6)
			(fact-iter 2 3 6)
			(fact-iter 6 4 6)
			(fact-iter 24 5 6)
			(fact-iter 120 6 6)
			(fact-iter 720 7 6)
			720
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The procedures compute the same thing, but notice how different their shapes
		are. With linear recursion, the computation expands &mdash; building a chain
		of <span class="italicsText">deferred operations</span> &mdash; then
		contracts &mdash; the operations are performed. This is called a
		<span class="term">recursive process</span>, and it requires the interpreter
		to keep track of of the operations to be performed later down the line. More
		specifically, we call this linear recursion because the length of the chain
		of deferred operations (i.e., the amount of information that must be
		tracked) grows linearly with ${n.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		However, with iteration, the computation does not grow or shrink. At each
		step, the interpreter needs only track
		<span class="monoText">product</span>,
		<span class="monoText">counter</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">max-count</span>. This is an
		<span class="term">iterative process</span> &mdash; generally, a process
		that can be summarized by a fixed number of
		<span class="term">state variables</span> (e.g.,
		<span class="monoText">counter</span>), together with a fixed rule
		describing how the state variables should be updated as the process moves
		from state to state, and an optional
		<span class="term">end test</span> specifying conditions for when the
		process terminates. In this case, the number of steps need to compute ${n!}$
		grows linearly with ${n.}$ As such, we call this particular iterative
		process a <span class="term">linear iterative process</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A closer inspection of the iterative approach might lead us to question
		whether it actually is an iterative process. The procedure is calling
		itself! Indeed, it is. But this where we clarify: There is a different
		between an <span class="italicsText">recursive process</span> and an
		<span class="italicsText">recursive procedure</span>. The term
		<span class="italicsText">recursive procedure</span> is a syntactical
		descriptor; the fact that the procedure definition refers to the procedure
		itself. The term <span class="italicsText">recursive process</span>,
		however, refers to <span class="italicsText">process evolution</span>, not
		syntax. Accordingly, the procedure above is, in fact, a recursive procedure.
		But, it is an iterative process.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a crucial distinction to understand because many languages &mdash;
		Go, C, Pascal, etc. &mdash; treat all recursive procedures as taking up an
		amount of memory that grows with each call, even if the process itself is
		iterative, not recursive. To ensure that iterative processes do not fall
		into this general treatment, the languages require use of
		<span class="term">looping constructs</span> to indicate iterative
		processes. These looping constructs are made with symbols like
		<span class="monoText">while</span>, <span class="monoText">for</span>,
		<span class="monoText">repeat</span>, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lisp (more specifically, Scheme) does not employ the same general rule. In
		particular, languages like Scheme and Lua not only decline using this rule,
		they in fact prohibit it. It executes iterative proceses in constant pace,
		even if the iterative process underlies a recursive procedure.
		Implementations with this process are called
		<span class="term">tail-recursive</span>.

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Consider the two procedures below. The
		procedure <span class="monoText">inc</span> increments its argument by
		<span class="monoText">1</span>, the procedure

		the process generated by each procedure in evaluating

						((= n 1) 1)
			(else (+ (fib (- n 1)) 
							(fib (- n 2))))))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Suppose we compute <span class="monoText">(fib 5)</span>. The entire
		computation can be viewed as a tree:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/fib5_expression_tree.svg' %}"
			alt="fib expressions"
			loading="lazy"
			class="eighty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This procedure, however, is a sterling example of a
		<span class="italicsText">Dorian Gray</span>. While the implementation is
		beautiful on the surface, it is inherently disturbing underneath. Given
		${\text{$Fib$}(n),}$ the procedure above computes
		<span class="monoText">(fib 1)</span> or
		<span class="monoText">(fib 0)</span> a total of ${\text{$Fib$}(n+1)}$
		times. Mathematically, the value of ${\text{$Fib$}(n)}$ is the closest
		integer to ${\dfrac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}}$ where ${\varphi = \dfrac{1 +
		\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.16180,}$ and ${\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1.}$ This means
		the value of ${\text{$Fib$}(n)}$ grows exponentially with ${n.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Why is this a problem? Because the number of steps required is proportional
		to the number of nodes in the tree. But, the amount of memory required to
		perform the computation is proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.
		Given that the number of steps grows exponentially with the input, the
		larger our inputs, the more and more memory we need to perform the
		computation. With sufficiently large inputs, the computer fans may begin
		humming and the program will crash.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will explore a possible remedy for this problem in later sections. For
		now, let us examine an iterative implementation:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define (fib n)
			(fib-iter 1 0 n))
		(define (fib-iter a b count)
			(if (= count 0)
				b
				(fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Here, we use two integers, <span class="monoText">a = 0</span> and
		<span class="monoText">b = 0</span> to represent
		<span class="monoText">fib(1) = 1</span> and
		<span class="monoText">fib(0) = 0</span>. We also provide a counter,
		<span class="monoText">count</span>, that decrements at each iteration. This
		implementation is a typical linear iteration. Here, the procedure takes a
		total of ${n}$ steps, where ${n}$ is the number we pass as an input to
		${\text{$Fib$}(n).}$ Undoubtedly, this is much better than the tree
		recursion approach.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> A function ${f}$ is defined as follows:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ f(n) = \begin{cases} n &\text{if } n < 3 \\[1em] f(n - 1) + 2f(n -2) +
		3f(n -3) &\text{if } n \geq 3 \end{cases} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Write a procedure that computes the function above recursively.</p>

		We begin with the list in Scheme. Before that, however, we introduce some
		terminology. In Scheme, an <span class="italicsText">atom</span> is the

		(1) is not a list; and (2) is not <span class="monoText">null</span>.

		From the exercises above, we see that
		<span class="monoText">car</span> returns the
		<span class="underlineText">first element</span> of a
		<span class="underlineText">nonempty list</span>. It will not work on atoms,
		nor will it work with the empty list.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why is it called <span class="monoText">car</span>? It's a relic from the
		ancient days of computing. Back then, Lisp ran on a machine called the IBM
		704, a computer so primitive it ran on vacuum tubes! Each
		&#8220;register&#8221; on the 704 had two key parts: an address component
		and a decrement component. That address component was called &#8220;Content
		of Address portion of Register&#8221; (&#8220;car&#8221;) and the decrement
		component was called &#8220;Content of Decrement portion of Register&#8221;
		(&#8220;cdr&#8221;). This brings us to our next operation,
		<span class="monoText">cdr</span>.
