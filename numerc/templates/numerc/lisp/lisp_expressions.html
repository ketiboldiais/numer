		<span class="topic">Expressions.</span> Below is an
		<span class="term">expression</span> in lisp:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-bash"><code>

	<p>
		Numbers are expressions, and so too are arithmetic operations with numbers:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(+ 200 75)
		(+ 3.5 4.0)
		(- 100 50)
		(- 50 100)
		(- 9.5 5.5)
		(* 111 7)
		(* 4 1.1)
		(* 4 -1.1)
		(/ 10 5)
		(sqr 3)
		(sqrt 16)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		275
		7.5
		50
		-50
		4
		777
		4.4
		-4.4

		9
		4
	</code></pre>

		All of the expressions above are called
		<span class="italicsText">combinations</span> &mdash; an expression enclosed
		by parentheses to indicate procedure application. The leftmost element is
		called the <span class="italicsText">operator</span>, and the elements
		operated on are called the <span class="italicsText">operands</span>. The
		operators used abvoe are called
		<span class="term">primitive operators</span>; they are operatres predefined
		by the language. Every expression evaluates to a
		<span class="term">value</span>. The general form of an expression in Lisp:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			<span class="blueText">(</span> <span class="redText">⟨primitive⟩</span> <span class="redText">⟨expression⟩</span> ... <span class="blueText">)</span>
		</code></pre>
		<figcaption>Note that numbers themselves are expressions.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note the difference between Lisp and numerous other languages:
		<span class="italicsText">prefix notation</span>. In most of languages and
		the mathematics we're familiar with, arithmetic operations are written in
		<span class="italicsText">inflix notation</span> (e.g., ${1 + 1.}$ Prefix
		notation, also known as Polish notation, places the operator farthest left
		(e.g., ${+ 1 1.}$ The benefit to prefix notation is that it allows us to
		write a single operator for numerous operands, thereby preventing any
		possible ambiguity:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(+ 1 2 3 4 5)
		(* 1 2 3 4 5)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		15
		120
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		A further benefit, we can easily nest operations while maintaining
		readability with <span class="italicsText">pretty printing</span> (indenting
		the code such that the operands are aligned vertically). This is called
		<span class="term">nested arithmetic</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(+ (* 10 3) (- 10 5))

		;; hard to read expression
		(+ (* 3 (+ (* 5 10) (+ 5 10))) (+ (- 15 5) 10))

		;; same expression, pretty printed
		(+ (* 3 
				(+ (* 5 10) 
					(+ 5 10))) 
			(+ (- 15 5) 
				10))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		35
		215
		215
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Above, we see our first example of a Lisp
		<span class="italicsText">comment</span> &mdash; code ignored by the Lisp
		interpreter. Notice that in Lisp, we do not need to use some function or
		method like <span class="monoText">console.log()</span> to display results
		to the console. This is because Lisp follows the principle that every
		expression has <span class="italicsText">value</span>. Obedience to this
		principle is so inherent in Lisp that the computer scientist Alan Perlis
		&mdash; the first recipient of the Turing award, for his work on programming
		techniques and compiler construction &mdash; commented: &#8220;Lisp
		programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.&#8221;
	</p>

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Suppose a right triangle ${\triangle
		ABC}$ has two legs of lengths 3 and 4. Write a Lisp expression that returns
		the value of the hypotenuse of ${\triangle ABC.}$
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			Recall that the the length of a right triangle's hypotenuse is given by
			the formula: ${a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2},}$ where ${a}$ is the length of the
			hypotenuse, and ${b}$ and ${c}$ are the lengths of the triangle's legs.
			Thus, in Lisp:

		<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
			(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqrt 4)))
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			5
		</code></pre>
	</details>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Non-terminating Real Numbers.</span> Computers have a
		finite amount of memory and processing power. Because of this limitation,
		computing irrational numbers like ${\sqrt{2}}$ results in what might appear
		odd:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(sqrt 2)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		#i1.4142135623730951
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The prefix <span class="monoText">#i</span> indicates that the value is an
		<span class="italicsText">inexact number</span>; the value of the expression
		is close to this number, but it not exactly.
