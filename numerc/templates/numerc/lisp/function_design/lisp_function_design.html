	<h3>Function Design</h3>
	<p>
		In the next sections, we explore the design model
		<b>function design</b> (&#8220;How to Design Functions&#8221;). This is
		a standard function design approach, and any good programmer should be
		familiar with it. We begin first with the problem statement:
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			Design a function that takes a number and produces twice that number.
			Call the function
			<var>double</var>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		This is a very simple problem, but that simplicity allows us to focus
		purely on function design design principles.
	</p>
	<p>function design design consists of five steps:</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<ol>
			<li>Signature, purpose, and stub.</li>
			<li>Define examples; wrap each example in check-expect.</li>
			<li>Template and inventory.</li>
			<li>Code the function body.</li>
			<li>Test and debug until correct.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		The first thing to do when designing a function is to state the
		function's
		<b>signature</b>. The signature is supposed to tell the reader what
		type of data the function consumes, and what type of data the function
		produces. In other words, the signature should quickly answer the
		questions: (a) What are input types, and (b) what are the output types?
	</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			type ... -> type
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>In other programming languages, we might write the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			int --> int
			float --> float
			boolean --> boolean
			string --> string
			boolean --> int
			int --> array
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>If the function takes more than argument:</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			int, boolean --> string
			float, string --> boolean
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>For this problem, we write the following:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Number -> Number
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The next thing is to state the function's <b>purpose</b>. The
		<i>purpose</i> should provide a succinct answer to the question: What
		does the function produce given what it consumes? Here, we write:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; produce 2 times the given number
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice how we use double semicolons (<var>;;</var>) to comment out
		these lines. We use double semicolons rather than single semicolons to
		indicate that these are permanently commented out. This is similar to
		the <i>docstring</i> in Python and JavaScript.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, the function's
		<b>stub</b>. The <i>stub</i> is like a piece of scaffolding &mdash; it
		helps us build other parts of the function. It lasts for only a brief
		period, and by the end of the function's construction, we delete it
		entirely. The stub consists of three parts:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>The function's <i>name</i>;</li>
			<li>The correct number of <i>parameters</i>;</li>
			<li>
				A dummy output of the
				<i>correct type</i>.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we write the following:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define (double n) 0)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If, say, we had a function that takes an
		<var>int</var> and outputs a <var>string</var>, we would write:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			(define (function_name n) "foo")
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>Returning to the problem, here is what we have so far:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(define (double n) 0)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Next step, we write examples and tests. These are one in the same; they
		serve as tests for our function. We write examples early on because
		functions are often much easier to write when we have a good idea of
		what they are going to do. The examples should illustrate behavior.
		Unique to racket, we wrap them in <var>check-expect</var> to tell the
		interpreter these are <i>unit tests</i>.
	</p>
	<p>For this function's examples, we write:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(check-expect (double 3) 6)
		(check-expect (double 4.2) 8.4)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Focusing on the first example, when we use
		<var>check-expect</var>, the interpreter will evaluate
		<var>(double 3)</var>, and check if the result is <var>6</var>. If the
		result is <var>6</var>, then the interpreter informs us we passed the
		test. If the result is not <var>6</var>, then the interpreter tells us
		we did not pass the test. Executing the code thus far:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) 6)
		(check-expect (double 4.2) 8.4)
		(define (double n) 0)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Ran 2 tests.
		0 tests passed.
		Check failures:
			Actual value 0 differs from 6, the expected value.
			Actual value 0 differs from 8.4, the expected value.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The fact that we are told they failed is a good sign because it tells
		us that the tests ran in the first place. This information allows us to
		conclude the examples are
		<i>well-formed</i> &mdash; we do not have syntax problems or other
		illegal expressions at this stage.
	</p>
	<p>
		This conclusion is critical for two reasons: (1) It eliminates a
		potential bug source from the very beginning, the function's head. This
		is a crucial point to check, because it is often the case that a
		function's head is one of the last places we would think of as causing
		a bug. (2) Even more importantly, it ensures that the tests actually
		run. We
		<em>never</em> want to be in a position where a test does not run; they
		are supposed to find bugs.
	</p>
	<p>
		With this stage is done, we comment out the stub, but leave a comment
		that indicating it is the stub. Thus, we have:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) 6)
		(check-expect (double 4.2) 8.4)

		;; stub
		; (define (double n) 0)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Passing the <i>Examples</i> stage, we proceed to <b>templating</b>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define (double n) 
			(... n))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This is <i>template</i>. It merely captures what the general contours
		are for this function &mdash; when we actually begin coding the
		function, the parameter <var>n</var> is what we are going to work with.
	</p>
	<p>Thus, what we have so far:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) 6)
		(check-expect (double 4.2) 8.4)

		;; stub
		; (define (double n) 0) ; stub

		(define (double n)
			(... n))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now we begin coding the body. Here, we copy and paste the template,
		then comment out the original template:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) 6)
		(check-expect (double 4.2) 8.4)

		;; stub
		; (define (double n) 0)

		;; template
		; (define (double n) 
		;   (... n))

		;; function body
		(define (double n)
			(... n))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now we start thinking about what will make this function work. To do
		so, we look back at everything we've written before: the signature,
		purpose, examples, and template. In particular, we focus on the
		examples, and elaborate them. To elaborate, we ask ourselves: Why are
		the expected results
		<var>6</var> and <var>8.4</var>? To answer that question, we must
		answer: How do we turn the inputs into the expected outputs? Here, the
		inputs map turn into the expected results because the evaluation is
		actually <var>(* 2 3)</var> and
		<var>(* 2 4.2)</var>
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) (* 2 3))
		(check-expect (double 4.2) (* 2 4.2))

		;; stub
		; (define (double n) 0)

		;; template
		; (define (double n) 
		;   (... n))

		;; function body
		(define (double n)
			(... n))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The process of elaborating on the examples is why we spend significant
		time studying evaluation models. We cannot elaborate on the examples if
		we do not know how the evaluations are done.
	</p>
	<p>Know that, we can now code the body:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) (* 2 3))
		(check-expect (double 4.2) (* 2 4.2))

		;; stub
		; (define (double n) 0)

		;; template
		; (define (double n) 
		;   (... n))

		;; function body
		(define (double n)
			(* 2 n))
	</code></pre>
	<p>. Now we test the function:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; number -> number
		;; produce 2 times the given number
		(check-expect (double 3) (* 2 3))
		(check-expect (double 4.2) (* 2 4.2))

		;; stub
		; (define (double n) 0)

		;; template
		; (define (double n) 
		;   (... n))

		;; function body
		(define (double n)
			(* 2 n))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Both tests passed!
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If a test every fails at this stage, there are three possibilities: (1)
		the function definition is wrong; (2) the test is wrong; (3) both the
		function definition and the test are wrong. Before we even look at the
		function definition, we should be 100% certain the test is correct.
	</p>
	<p>
		The beauty of function design is that each step is aids in completing
		the next step. The signature helps us write the purpose, the purpose
		helps us write a stub. The stub helps us write examples, and the
		examples help us write templates. The templates then help us write the
		body, as well as the tests and debuggings. As long as we take the time
		to carefully think about each step and complete them thoroughly, the
		next step is made all the more easy.

		We study program design because real-world problems are almost always
		poorly stated. The fact is, most problems need to be addressed even if
		we do not have a clear statement of the problem. When we encounter such
		a problem, the first thing to consider is
		<b>specification</b> &mdash; make the problem more specific. For
		example, suppose the following problem:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
				Design a function that takes an image argument and determines whether the image is tall.
			</code></pre>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Step 1: The function's signature. We know that the function takes an
		image as input, but what exactly does
		<var>tall</var> mean? Well, we know that the answer to this question is
		yes or no. Yes the image is tall, no the image is not tall. These are
		binary values. Now, we do not quite know yet what
		<var>tall</var> means, but design one step at a time. Right now, we are
		just focused on the input and output types. Since the output is a
		binary value, we use <var>Boolean</var>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; image --> Boolean
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 2: The function's purpose. Now we answer the next question. What
		is this function's purpose?
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 3: The function's stub. The problem does not provide what to name
		this function, so we must provide a name ourselves. To do so, we follow
		the programming language's naming conventions. In racket, the
		convention is, if the function produced a Boolean (as our function
		does), we append a question mark to the function's name:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(define (tall? img) false)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 4: Tests. Write some tests. But how many do we write? For now,
		let's just stick with one test. We will later see that we need more
		than one.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)
		
		(define (tall? img) false)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Running the tests, they fail. This means the tests are working
		properly, and we can continue to the next step.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 5: Templating. Now we write the template. Remember, this is just a
		rough outline.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub

		(define (tall? img)
			(... img))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 6: Write the function. Now we copy the template, comment out the
		template, and begin writing the function:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub

		; (define (tall? img) ; template
			; (... img))
		
		(define (tall? img)
			(... img))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		So, how do we write this function. First, we think about what we know.
		There are only two cases: Either (a) the image is tall, or (b) the
		image is not tall. Thus, this is a case analysis problem. And where
		there is a case analysis, there are conditional statements. Let's write
		three
		<var>if</var> condition templates:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub

		; (define (tall? img) ; template
			; (... img))
		
		(define (tall? img)
			(if (... img)
			(... img)
			(... img)))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now we ask ourselves, when is something &#8220;tall&#8221;? Well,
		something is tall if it is horizontally longer than it is vertically
		wide. This means we are comparing width to the height.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub

		; (define (tall? img) ; template
			; (... img))
		
		(define (tall? img)
			(if (> (image-height img) (image-width img))
			true
			false))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Running the code above, the test passed. But what is the problem here?
		We do not have enough tests. We passed the test, but we never tested
		whether
		<var>false</var> actually outputs. We did not achieve
		<b>code coverage</b> &mdash; testing every part of the code.
		Accordingly, we need a test that verifies <var>false</var> actually
		outputs:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall 
			;; produce false if the image is not tall
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 3 2 "solid" "red")) false)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub

		; (define (tall? img) ; template
			; (... img))
		
		(define (tall? img)
			(if (> (image-height img) (image-width img))
			true
			false))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Code coverage is the bare minimum for testing. Whenever we test code,
		we must achieve complete code coverage. We say it is the bare minimum
		because there are often several other tests we still need to provide.
		One of those is a <b>corner case</b> test. We call this
		<var>boundary coverage</var>. For this implementation, the corner case
		is: What if the image and the height are the same?
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever we encounter a corner case, we must immediately perform
		several steps: (1) write a test right away; (3) decide what
		<i>should</i> happen in the corner case (in other words, how should
		this function behave when it is given a corner case); (2) finally,
		update all affected parts of the design (this might require updating
		the signature, purpose, function definition, etc.).
	</p>
	<p>
		Here, we are going to see that if the width and the height are the
		same, then the image is not tall. Here, we just need to update the
		purpose.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)
		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose:
			;; produce true if the image is tall (height is greater than width)
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "red")) true)
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 3 2 "solid" "red")) false)
		(check-expect (tall? (rectangle 2 2 "solid" "red")) false)

		;(define (tall? img) false) ; stub

		; (define (tall? img) ; template
			; (... img))
		
		(define (tall? img)
			(if (> (image-height img) (image-width img))
			true
			false))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The function passes all of the tests above. Notice that this function
		really only uses a Boolean comparison operator, so we can make the code
		more concise:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(require 2htdp/image)

		;; image --> Boolean
		;; purpose: produce true if the image is tall (height is greater than width)
		(define (tall? img)
			(> (image-height img) (image-width img)))
	</code></pre>
