	<h3>Data Design</h3>
	<p>
		In this section, we explore
		<b><var>data design</var></b> ("How to Design Data Definitions")
		design. <var>data design</var> provides a design approach for
		representing data from the problem's domain. Designing data is a
		critical point for understanding paradigms like object-oriented
		programming. Often, the way we solve a problem is dependent on how we
		present the data. This is because functions can only work if they are
		provided data, and <i>how</i> a function works depends on the data it
		consumes.
	</p>
	<p>
		This approach is not limited to computer science. For example, a lawyer
		must be able to successfully argue for his client in court. But to do
		so, they must be able to present the facts in a favorable light &mdash;
		they must
		<i>design</i> the data representation. The design approach of
		<var>data design</var> prvodies a systematic means to do so.
	</p>

	<p>
		<var>data design</var> is premised on the idea that real world
		information can be represented as data in a program. This is derived
		from the view that every problem has a <b>problem domain</b> &mdash;
		the data provided by the problem. For example, we might be asked to
		design a traffic light system. Information in this problem's domain
		includes green, yellow, and red lights. In computers, however, there is
		no such thing as a &#8220;green light&#8221; or any light for that
		matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		To solve this problem, we must
		<i>represent</i> information in the problem domain as data in the
		computer. Likewise, we must provide a way to <i>interpret</i> that data
		as representing information in the problem domain.
	</p>
	<p>The data definition consists of four to five parts:</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>A possible <i>structure definition</i>.</li>
			<li>A <i>type comment</i> describing how to form the data.</li>
			<li>
				An
				<i>interpretation comment</i> describing the correspondence between
				the information and the data.
			</li>
			<li>One or more <i>examples</i> of the data.</li>
			<li>
				A <i>template</i> for a 1 argument function operating on data of
				the data type.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>

	<p>Consider the following problem parameter:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>The problem requires data about the names of cities.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because of this parameter, we need a data definition to represent the
		name of a city. To construct a data definition, we follow the steps
		below.
	</p>

	<p>
		Step 1: Form. The first step to constructing a data definition is to
		answer the following question: What is the form of the information we
		seek to represent? One way to answer this question is to simply write
		out examples of this information:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Information:
			; New York City
			; Boston
			; Los Angeles
			; Chicago
			; Palo Alto
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now the question is: How do we represent this information as data? A
		good jumping off point is to consider the most common representations:
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>Information</th>
				<th>Representation</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>atomic</td>
					<td>simple atomic data</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>numbers within a range</td>
					<td>interval</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>consists of a fixed number of distinct entities</td>
					<td>enumeration</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						comprised of 2 or more subclasses, at least one of which is not
						a distinct item
					</td>
					<td>itemization</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						consists of two or more items that naturally belong together
					</td>
					<td>compound data</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>naturally composed of different parts</td>
					<td>references to other defined type</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>is or arbitrary (unknown) size</td>
					<td>self-referential or mutually referential</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The above may seem vague at the moment, but we will explore them in
		more detail as we continue. Here, the most applicable structure is
		<i>atomic</i>. When say that data is <i>atomic</i>, we mean that the
		data cannot be broken down into any further meaningful pieces. Here,
		the city names are just that &mdash; they are city names, and they
		cannot be broken down any further to provide anythng meaningful.
		Accordingly, our data definition will be atomic. We write the comment:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; CityName is String
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 1a: Interpretation. Now, we need to next include an interpretation
		comment. This comment should answer the question, What does this data
		mean?
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; CityName is String
		;; interp. the name of a city
	</code></pre>
	<p>Step 2: Examples. Now we want to provide some examples:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; CityName is String
		;; interp. the name of a city
		(define CN1 "Boston")
		(define CN2 "Chicago")
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Step 3: Templates. Next, we write a template for the data definition.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; CityName is String
		;; interp. the name of a city
		(define CN1 "Boston")
		(define CN2 "Chicago")

		#;
		(define (fn-for-city-name cn)
			(... cn))
		;; Template rules used
		;; - atomic-distinct: String
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now, let's write a function, using <var>function design</var>, that
		consumes non-primitive data (the data we defined above). We will just
		write a simple function that returs <var>true</var> if the city name
		passed into it is the best city in the world. We will use
		<var>Chicago</var> here.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Data definitions:
		;; CityName is String
		;; interp. the name of a city
		(define CN1 "Boston")
		(define CN2 "Chicago")

		#;
		(define (fn-for-city-name cn)
			(... cn))
		;; Template rules used
		;; - atomic-distinct: String


		;; Functions:

		;; CityName --> Boolean
		;; Purpose:
		;;	Produce true if CityName is Chicago

		(check-expect (best? "Chicago") true)
		(check-expect (best? "Boston") false)

		; (define (best? cn) false) ; stub

		;; took template from CityName
		(define (best? cn)
			(if (string=? cn "Chicago") 
				true 
				false))
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		We use <i>interval data</i> to represent information consisting of
		numbers within a particular range. Consider the following problem
		parameter:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				We are designing a program that manages ticket sales for a
				perfectly rectangular theater. The program requires a data
				definition representing a seat number in a row, where each row has
				32 seats.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first thing to note is the information given by the problem. Here,
		it is the seat numbers. These seat numbers run from 1 to 32. Because
		these numbers go from 1 to 32 &mdash; a range &mdash; they are
		necessarily
		<i>intervals</i>. Thus, we write our type comment:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; SeatNum is Integer[1, 32]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The use of the square brackets come directly from mathematics. They
		communicate that the interval is 1 and 32
		<i>inclusive</i>. If the interval was 1 and 32 <i>exclusive</i>, we
		would write <var>(1, 32)</var>. Next, we write the interpretation
		comment:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; SeatNum is Integer[1, 32]
		;; interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice that we included another bit of information towards the end
		&mdash; that 1 and 32 are aisle seats.
		<em>Anything</em> that would help better understand how the data
		corresponds to the information should always be included in the
		interpretation comment.
	</p>

	<p>Now we write some examples:</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; SeatNum is Integer[1, 32]
		;; interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats
		(define SN1 1) ;aisle
		(define SN2 12) ;middle
		(define SN3 32) ;aisle
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Observe that we added comments to the examples. We want to include
		examples that are illustrative of how the data corresponds to the
		information. Examples done, the next step is templating:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; SeatNum is Integer[1, 32]
		;; interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats
		(define SN1 1) ;aisle
		(define SN2 12) ;middle
		(define SN3 32) ;aisle

		#;
		(define (fn-for-seat-num sn)
			(... sn))

		;; template rules used:
		;;   - atomic non-distinct: Interval[1, 32]
	</code></pre>

	<p>Done. We are now given this problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				Using the <var>SeatNum</var> data definition, design a function
				that produces <var>true</var> if the given seat number is on the
				aisle.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Following <var>function design</var>, we: (1) write the function's
		signature, purpose, and stub; (2) write tests; (3) write templates; (4)
		code the body; and (5) test and debug.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; SeatNum is Integer[1, 32]
		;; interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats
		(define SN1 1) ;aisle
		(define SN2 12) ;middle
		(define SN3 32) ;aisle

		#;
		(define (fn-for-seat-num sn)
			(... sn))

		;; template rules used:
		;;   - atomic non-distinct: Interval[1, 32]

		;; Function
		;; SeatNum --> Boolean
		;; produce true if SeatNum is aisle, otherwise false

		(check-expect (aisle? 1) true)
		(check-expect (aisle? 12) false)

		(define (aisle? SeatNum) true)
	</code></pre>
	<p>Both tests ran, so we can proceed:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; SeatNum is Integer[1, 32]
		;; interp. seat numbers in a row, 1 and 32 are aisle seats
		(define SN1 1) ;aisle
		(define SN2 12) ;middle
		(define SN3 32) ;aisle

		#;
		(define (fn-for-seat-num sn)
			(... sn))

		;; template rules used:
		;;   - atomic non-distinct: Interval[1, 32]

		;; Functions
		;; SeatNum --> Boolean
		;; produce true if SeatNum is aisle, otherwise false

		(check-expect (aisle? 1) true)
		(check-expect (aisle? 12) false)
		(check-expect (aisle? 32) true)

		;; (define (aisle? SeatNum) true)

		;; (define (aisle? SeatNum)
			;; (... seatNum))
		
		(define (aisle? seatNum) 
			(cond [(or (= 1 seatNum) (= 32 seatNum)) true]
					[else false]))
	</code></pre>
	<p>Testing, all tests passed.</p>

	<p>
		We use <i>enumeration</i> when the information consists of two or more
		<em>distinct</em> values. For example, consider the following problem
		parameter:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				We are designing a program to keep track of student grades. The
				program requires representing three letter grades: A, B, and C.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The defining characteristic for the information we seek to represent:
		They are three, distinct values. An <var>A</var> is an <var>A</var>, a
		<var>B</var> is a <var>B</var>, and a <var>C</var> is a <var>C</var>.
		They are clearly separate and unique, and every letter grade can only
		be one of the three. We can think of these as terniary values. Where
		binary values are true or false, terniary values consist of three
		&mdash; <var>A, B, C</var>; <var>black, grey, white</var>;
		<var>red light, yellow light, green light</var>. When we encounter such
		values, the first option to consider is enumeration.
	</p>
	<p>First, the type comment:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; LetterGrade is one of: 
		;;  - "A"
		;;  - "B"
		;;  - "C"
		;; interp. the letter grade for a course
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now, examples are redundant for this particular enumeration, because
		the interpretation tells us all that we need. So, we write:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; LetterGrade is one of: 
		;;  - "A"
		;;  - "B"
		;;  - "C"
		;; interp. the letter grade for a course
		;; ⟨examples are redundant for enumerations⟩
	</code></pre>
	<p>Now we write the template:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; LetterGrade is one of: 
		;;  - "A"
		;;  - "B"
		;;  - "C"
		;; interp. the letter grade for a course
		;; ⟨examples are redundant for enumerations⟩

		(define (fn-for-letter-grade lg)
			(cond [(string=? lg "A") ...]
					[(string=? lg "B") ...]
					[(string=? lg "C") ...]))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Enumerations are a strong indicator of subclasses. In this case, the
		class letter grade has three subclasses &mdash;
		<var>A, B, C</var>. This is particularly useful fact when considering
		object-orientation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Needless to say, enumerations only work for a finite amount of
		elements. When there are infinitely many elements, then the appropriate
		data definition is an interval, which collects elements that satisfy a
		property.
	</p>

	<p>Now we're given the following problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				Using the <var>LetterGrade</var> data definition, design a function
				called <var>bump-up</var> that consumes a letter grade and produces
				the next highest letter grade.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Again, we use <var>function design</var>: (1) Write the signature,
		purpose, and stub; (2) write the tests; (3) write the template; (4)
		write the body; and (5) test and debug.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Data definitions
		;; LetterGrade is one of: 
		;;  - "A"
		;;  - "B"
		;;  - "C"
		;; interp. the letter grade for a course
		;; ⟨examples are redundant for enumerations⟩

		;; (define (fn-for-letter-grade lg)
			;; (cond [(string=? lg "A") ...]
					;; [(string=? lg "B") ...]
					;; [(string=? lg "C") ...]))

		
		;; Functions
		;; bump-up
		;; LetterGrade --> LetterGrade
		;; consumes a LetterGrade, produces the next highest LetterGrade

		(check-expect (bump-up "C") "B")
		(check-expect (bump-up "B") "A")
		(check-expect (bump-up "A") "A")

		(define (bump-up LetterGrade) "A")
	</code></pre>
	<p>The tests work, so we continue:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Data definitions
		;; LetterGrade is one of: 
		;;  - "A"
		;;  - "B"
		;;  - "C"
		;; interp. the letter grade for a course
		;; ⟨examples are redundant for enumerations⟩

		;; (define (fn-for-letter-grade lg)
			;; (cond [(string=? lg "A") ...]
					;; [(string=? lg "B") ...]
					;; [(string=? lg "C") ...]))

		
		;; Functions
		;; bump-up
		;; LetterGrade --> LetterGrade
		;; consumes a LetterGrade, produces the next highest LetterGrade

		(check-expect (bump-up "C") "B")
		(check-expect (bump-up "B") "A")
		(check-expect (bump-up "A") "A")

		;; (define (bump-up LetterGrade) "A")

		;; (define (bump-up LetterGrade)
			;; (... LetterGrade))

		(define (bump-up LetterGrade)
			(cond [(string=? LetterGrade "B") "A"]
					[(string=? LetterGrade "C") "B"]
					[else "A"]))
	</code></pre>
	<p>All three tests passed.</p>

	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				We are designing a program for controlling the New Year's Eve
				countdown display. Design a data definition representing the
				current state of the countdown, which falls into one of three
				categories: (1) not yet started; (2) from 10 to 1 seconds before
				midnight; (3) complete.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The problem parameter tells us that the information falls into one of
		three categories: (1) before the countdown starts; (2) during the
		countdown; and (3) when the countdown ends. This is similar to the
		letter grade categories, but there are some differences. Categories (1)
		and (2) are distinct; they have a clear state &mdash; countdown hasn't
		started and countdown has ended. But in the second category, there
		isn't a single distinct value &mdash; the values run from 10 to 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		This parameter is a good example of
		<i>itemization</i> &mdash; the domain information consists of 2 or more
		subclasses, but at least one of those subclasses is <em>not</em> a
		distinct value.
	</p>
	<p>First, the type comment.</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Countdown is one of:
		;; - false 
		;; - Natural(1, 10);
		;; - "Complete"	
	</code></pre>
	<p>Second, the interpretation comment:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Countdown is one of:
		;; - false 
		;; - Natural(1, 10);
		;; - "Complete"
		;; interp. 
			;; false means countdown has not yet started
			;; Natural(1, 10) means countdown is running
			;; "Complete" means countdown has ended
	</code></pre>
	<p>Now we need examples:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Countdown is one of:
		;; - false 
		;; - Natural(1, 10);
		;; - "Complete"
		;; interp. 
			;; false means countdown has not yet started
			;; Natural(1, 10) means countdown is running
			;; "Complete" means countdown has ended
		(define CD1 false)
		(define CD2 10) ;; just started
		(define CD3 1) ;; almost over
		(define CD4 "complete")
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Next, templating. This is where we encounter some complexity. Here, our
		data consists of a range and two distinct values. This is an example of
		<b>mixed data</b> &mdash; we have a Boolean, a number, and a string.
		This means we have to be very careful with this. Part of our data
		definition requires using comparison operators, and we cannot use such
		operators for strings or Booleans. Because this is a mixed data
		itemization, we must guard against anything that is not a number being
		passed into the comparison operators.
	</p>
	<p>
		Accordingly, we need to include a test in addition to the comparisons:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Countdown is one of:
		;; - false 
		;; - Natural(1, 10);
		;; - "Complete"
		;; interp. 
			;; false means countdown has not yet started
			;; Natural(1, 10) means countdown is running
			;; "Complete" means countdown has ended
		(define CD1 false)
		(define CD2 10) ;; just started
		(define CD3 1) ;; almost over
		(define CD4 "complete")

		(define (fn-for-countdown c) 
		(cond [(false? c) (...)]
				[(and (number? c) (<= 1 c) (<= c 10)) (...)]
				[else (...)]))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice that in the last line, we have an
		<var>else</var> condition, rather than using the data
		<var>"complete"</var>. This is because if all of the above conditions
		are <var>false</var>, then it <em>must</em> be the case that the
		countdown has ended. Running a quick test, we do not get any errors so
		our data definition is complete.
	</p>
	<p>
		But, there is a small optimization we can make. Really, we do not need
		the comparison operators. This is because the countdown is the only
		<var>number</var> type value among all the other subclasses. This means
		we can get rid of all the comparison operators:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; Countdown is one of:
		;; - false 
		;; - Natural(1, 10);
		;; - "Complete"
		;; interp. 
			;; false means countdown has not yet started
			;; Natural(1, 10) means countdown is running
			;; "Complete" means countdown has ended
		(define CD1 false)
		(define CD2 10) ;; just started
		(define CD3 1) ;; almost over
		(define CD4 "complete")

		(define (fn-for-countdown c) 
			(cond [(false? c) (...)]
					[(number? c) (...)]
					[else (...)]))
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Mixed data types are often a source for improved code. Consider the
		following problem paramter:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				We are designing a traffic light sytem that can either (a) be
				disabled or (b) be one of <var>red</var>, <var>yellow</var>, or
				<var>green</var>.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>We might write the data defintion as the following:</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; TrafficLight is one of:
			;; - false
			;; - "red"
			;; - "yellow"
			;; - "green"
		;; interp.
			;; "false" - disabled
			;; "red" - red light
			;; "yellow" - yellow light
			;; "green" - green light
		(define TrafficLight0 false)
		(define TrafficLight1 "red")
		(define TrafficLight2 "yellow")
		(define TrafficLight3 "green")

		(define (fn-for-light) TrafficLight
		(cond 
			[(false? TrafficLight) (...)]
			[(and (string? TrafficLight) (string=? TrafficLight "red")) (...)]
			[(and (string? TrafficLight) (string=? TrafficLight "yellow")) (...)]
			[(and (string? TrafficLight) (string=? TrafficLight "green")) (...)]))
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice the this is a mixed data itemization, so we used guards for
		strings. But, the code can be simplified even further: Once we get to
		the condition for <var>"red"</var>, there are no other data types other
		than string. Everything after <var>"red"</var> is a
		<var>string</var> value. This evidences a rule for mixed data
		itemizations: If all the remaining cases are the same data type, then
		we can get rid of the guards:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		;; TrafficLight is one of:
			;; - false
			;; - "red"
			;; - "yellow"
			;; - "green"
		;; interp.
			;; "false" - disabled
			;; "red" - red light
			;; "yellow" - yellow light
			;; "green" - green light
		(define TrafficLight0 false)
		(define TrafficLight1 "red")
		(define TrafficLight2 "yellow")
		(define TrafficLight3 "green")

		(define (fn-for-light) TrafficLight
		(cond 
			[(false? TrafficLight) (...)]
			[(string=? TrafficLight "red") (...)]
			[(string=? TrafficLight "yellow") (...)]
			[(string=? TrafficLight "green") (...)]))
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The template looks much simpler. The examples above evidence two rules
		for mixed data itemizations: (1) If a given subclass is the last
		subclass of its type, we can reduce the test to just the guard. (2) If
		all remaining subclasses are of the same type, then we can eliminate
		the guards.
	</p>

	<p>Now we're presented with the following problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				Design a function that consumes
				<var>Countdown</var> and returns the status of the countdown:
				either (a) <var>"countdown uninitiated"</var>; (b)
				<var>"countdown initiated"</var>; or (c)
				<var>"countdown finished"</var>.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		We follow <var>function design</var>: (1) Write the signature, purpose,
		and stub; (2) write the tests; (3) write the templates; (4) code the
		body; and (5) test and debug.
	</p>

		In all of the previous examples, we saw how designing data informs the
		function's design, and tests' designs. The information's structure
		informs the data structure, the data structure informs the function
		structure, and the function structure informs the test structures. This
		is called
		<var>information flow</var>. Information flow demonstrates a critical
		rule in systematic program design: Before we even begin typing, we must
		identify and understand the relevant information's structure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under systematic program design, data definitions are a leverage point
		for designing and structuring a program. However, that leverage point
		only exists if we understand the relevant information's structure. Now,
		not all programs are conducive to this
		<i>data-driven approach</i>. Some programs will require different
		approaches. One such approach is the <i>control-driven approach</i>, a
		tactic to be explored in later sections. Nevertheless, the point
		remains: Understanding the relevant information before we touch the
		keyboard is critical to well-designed programs.

	<h3>Compound Data</h3>
	<p>
		In the previous examples, we worked purely with
		<i>atomic data</i> &mdash; a single value. But information is not
		composed of single values. A point in space has three values grouped
		together: ${(x, y, z).}$ A phone book entry consists of a name and a
		phone number. These are all examples of information that must be
		represented as <i>compound data</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To create compound data in racket, we use
		<var>define-struct</var>. Suppose we want to create a data structure
		representing a piece of compound data &mdash; a Cartesian coordinate.
		We write:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct position (x_coordinate y_coordinate))
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The <var>(x_coordinate y_coordinate)</var> following
		<var>define-struct position</var> is called a <i>field</i>. The symbol
		<var>position</var> is simply the name of our data structure. With the
		<var>position</var> data structure defined, we can now create a
		<var>position</var> structure with a <b>constructor</b>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct position (x_coordinate y_coordinate))

		;; This is called a constructor
		(make-position 3 6)
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can name the data structures we've created:</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct position (x-coordinate y-coordinate))

		(define origin(make-position 0 0))
		(define point_1(make-position 3 6))
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we want to access the fields
		<var>x-coordinate</var> or <var>y-coordinate</var>, we use
		<b>selectors</b>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct position (x_coordinate y_coordinate))

		(define origin(make-position 0 0))
		(define point_1(make-position 3 6))

		;; these are called selectors
		(position-x_coordinate origin)
		(position-y_coordinate origin)
		(position-x_coordinate point_1)
		(position-y_coordinate point_1)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		0
		0
		3
		6
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Finally, we can ask &#8220;Is this value produced by
		<var>make-position</var>?&#8221; with a <b>predicate</b>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct position (x_coordinate y_coordinate))

		(define origin(make-position 0 0))
		(define point_1(make-position 3 6))

		(position? origin)
		(position? "line")
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		#true
		#false
	</code></pre>

	<p>In sum, to form a structure definition, we write:</p>

	<figure>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			(define-struct ⟨<i>data-structure-name</i>⟩ (⟨<i>field-name</i>⟩ ...))
		</code></pre>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Now that we know how to create compound data, we now apply the
		<var>data design</var> approach to construct a data definition.
		Consider the following problem:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				Design a data definition to represent employee names at the
				company. An employee name consists of a first and last name.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The key indicator of a piece of compound data is two or more values
		that
		<i>naturally belong together</i>. In this case, the problem statement
		evidences a clear piece of compound data &mdash; a name, which consists
		of a first and last name. Recall the <var>data design</var> procedure:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Write a possible structure definition.</li>
		<li>
			Write a type comment defining a new type name and describing how to
			form data.
		</li>
		<li>
			Write an interpretation comment describing how the data corresponds
			to information.
		</li>
		<li>Write one or more examples of the data.</li>
		<li>
			Write a template for a 1 argument function operating on the data.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		First step: A possible structure definition. Here, the data structure
		is fairly straightforward:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct employeeName (firstName lastName))
	</code></pre>

	<p>Second step: Write a type comment.</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct employee (firstName lastName))
		;; employee is (make-employee String String)
		;; interp. (make-employee firstName lastName) is an employee with
		;;   firstName := first name
		;;   lastName := last name
	</code></pre>

	<p>Third step: Write an example.</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct employee (firstName lastName))
		;; employee is (make-employee String String)
		;; interp. (make-employee firstName lastName) is an employee with
		;;   firstName := first name
		;;   lastName := last name
		(define leoE(make-employee "Leonard" "Euler"))
		(define blaiseP(make-employee "Blaise" "Pascal"))
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Fourth step: a template for a 1 argument function operating on the
		data.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-scheme"><code>
		(define-struct employee (firstName lastName))
		;; employee is (make-employee String String)
		;; interp. (make-employee firstName lastName) is an employee with
		;;   firstName := first name
		;;   lastName := last name
		(define leoE(make-employee "Leonard" "Euler"))
		(define blaiseP(make-employee "Blaise" "Pascal"))

		; (define (func-for-employee employee)
		;	 (... (employee-firstName employee)) ;; string
		;	 (... (employee-lastName employee))) ;; string
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In our function template, we explicitly listed the
		<i>selectors</i> we can use. We do not <em>have</em> to use the
		selectors, but we explicitly write them out because future instances of
		<var>employee</var> will have those fields.
	</p>

	<p>
		As we saw with <var>module design</var>, a critical part of systematic
		program design is breaking down a problem into smaller pieces. The same
		idea applies to function design. When we design large, complex
		functions, we often want to break them down into smaller, more easily
		testable functions. This approach embodies the idea of
		<b>function composition</b> &mdash; a function performing two or more
		operations depending on the data inputs. For example, consider a
		self-driving car. We input a final destination, and from there, the car
		drives us to the location. This is an example of enormously complex
		function that performs numerous operations. However, by breaking the
		function down into smaller <i>sub-functions</i>, the task is less
		daunting. While we are not designing such gargantuan programs, the idea
		is the same &mdash; break the problem down into smaller and smaller
		pieces.
