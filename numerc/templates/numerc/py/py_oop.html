	<h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
	<p>
		The ability to define functions allows us to write procedures and treat them
		as though they were built into the language, just like
		<span class="monoText">+, -, /, *, %</span> operators, or the build in
		methods like <span class="monoText">len()</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we want to do the same thing with data &mdash; creating
		<span class="italicsText">objects</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">classes of objects</span>. This ability
		drastically increases our ability to write complex and efficient programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have already encountered a number of objects:
		<span class="monoText">int</span>, <span class="monoText">string</span>,
		<span class="monoText">boolean</span>, etc. These are all data objects. We
		have also seen data structures, which themselves are data objects: tuples,
		lists, and dictionaries.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of these objects have (1) a <span class="italicsText">type</span>; (2)
		an <span class="italicsText">internal data representation</span> - whether
		the object is primitive or composite; and (3) a set of procedures for
		interacting with that particular object.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following are all <span class="term">instances</span> of a data object
		type: <span class="monoText">8</span> is an instance of
		<span class="monoText">int</span>; <span class="monoText">True</span> is an
		instance of <span class="monoText">boolean</span>;
		<span class="monoText">2.44</span> is an instance of
		<span class="monoText">float</span>;
		<span class="monoText">'hello'</span> is an instance of
		<span class="monoText">string</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of this lends to an underlying principle grounding Python &mdash; nearly
		everything in Python is an object with a type. Objects, more generally, are
		<span class="italicsText">data abstractions</span>. That abstraction
		captures two things: (a) the
		<span class="italicsText">data attributes</span> and (b) it defines the
		data's <span class="italicsText">interface</span> through
		<span class="italicsText">methods</span> (procedures), which has the effect
		of defining the data object's
		<span class="italicsText">behavior</span> while hiding the object's
		implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		With every data object, we can create new instances of that data object's
		type. Checking that ability, we can also destroy instances of that
		particular data object's type, either explicitly with methods like
		<span class="monoText">del</span>, or implicitly by allowing Python's
		garbage collection to eventually remove them from memory.
	</p>
	<p>
		To repeat, data objects are abstractions, just as functions are
		abstractions. For example, consider the data type
		<span class="monoText">list</span>. How are lists represented internally? It
		turns out lists in Python are
		<span class="italicsText">linked lists</span> &mdash; each list element
		consists of (a) the literal stored (itself a data object), and (b) a pointer
		to the next element in the list. We have many ways of manipulating the list:
		we can index, obtain length, find the max, etc. The data object
		<span class="monoText">list</span> allows us to create, manipulate, and
		destroy lists without worrying about the lower level implementation details
		&mdash; allocating memory, assigning pointers, freeing memory, etc. Data
		objects abstract away the technicalities.
