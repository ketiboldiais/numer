	<h1>Computational Thinking with Python</h1>
	<p>
		In these next few sections, we switch from C to Python. Going from C to
		Python is like living in the Alaskan wild and suddenly being thrust into New
		York City. So much of what we want to do in terms of programming is already
		taken care of for us &mdash; things like memory management; being careful
		with types; where we place our code; it's all handled for us by Python.
		Nevertheless, just as the skills we might learn from living in the
		wilderness are useful anywhere we live, the skills we learned in C &mdash;
		methodical thinking, resourcefulness, and case considerations &mdash; remain
		useful as we cover Python.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we saw, C is a very low level language, sitting close to the computer's
		actual hardware. This makes it a useful language for learning cost-benefit
		analysis, a critical skill in computer science, as well as understanding how
		computers work at their core. The downside: For every hour we spend studying
		cost-benefit analyses and exploring how computers work, that's an hour taken
		away from other aspects of computer science. To spend time on those other
		aspects, we need a language that abstracts away all of the lower level
		details so we don't have to worry about them. That language is python.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the sections on C, we focused on a variety of topics &mdash; basic
		programming concepts like conditions and loops, to more complex topics like
		pointers and linked lists. Now we must go even further up the layers of
		abstraction, and focus on
		<span class="boldItalics">computational methods</span> &mdash; the
		techniques used to solve problems
		<span class="italicsText">computationally</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before we proceed, a quick review of rudimentary computer science terms and
		concepts: An <span class="italicsText">algorithm</span> is a concept, and a
		program is a concrete implementation of that algorithm. The
		<span class="italicsText">computational approach</span> is a problem solving
		philosophy resting on the premise that every problem can be viewed in terms
		of mathematics, and can be solved with numbers and formulas. The field of
		<span class="italicsText">computer science</span> is the study of how to
		build efficient machines &mdash; physical or abstract &mdash; that run
		programs.

	<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
	<p>
		A programming language provides a set of
		<span class="boldItalics">primitive operations</span>. With those primitive
		operations, we can write <span class="boldItalics">expressions</span>.
		Expressions are what we use to perform computations. In all programming
		languages, expressions and computations have a
		<span class="boldItalics">value</span> &mdash; their
		<span class="italicsText">meaning</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		More explicitly, any programming language will have the following
		properties:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>primitives;</li>
		<li>
			a means of combination &mdash; how primitives are arranged to form
			expressions; and
		</li>
		<li>
			a means of abstraction &mdash; a way of taking an expression and treating
			it as a primitive.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		In most programming languages, there are several primitives: booleans,
		numbers, strings (or sequences of characters), and simple arithmetic
		operations (addition, subtraction, comparison, etc.). These primitives can
		be arranged and combined to form newer things, just as bricks of legos can
		be connected to form grand structures.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike legos, however, there are rules about how we can connect and arrange
		primitives. These rules fall into two categories: (1)
		<span class="boldItalics">syntax</span> and (2)
		<span class="boldItalics">semantics</span>. This is similar to English.
		Syntax is the set of rules that defines what is a valid arrangement of
		primitives (an expression) in a given programming language. In English, the
		word arrangement "a plane head fly" is not a valid sentence, but the
		arrangement "a plane flies overhead" is. Programming languages have similar
		rules. In Python, the arrangement <span class="monoText">2.9"12"</span> is
		not a valid expression. But the arrangement
		<span class="monoText">2.9 * 12</span> is. When an expression satisfies all
		of a programming language's syntax rules, we say that the expression is
		<span class="boldItalics">syntatically valid</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just as sentences in English have meaning, so too do expressions in
		programming languages. In computer science, an expressions meaning is
		governed by <span class="boldItalics">semantics</span> &mdash; the set of
		all rules that define <span class="italicsText">when</span> an expression
		has meaning, and what that meaning is. Within semantics, there are two
		subsets: (a) <span class="boldItalics">static semantics</span> and (b)
		<span class="boldItalics">full semantics</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Static semantics is the set of all rules determining
		<span class="italicsText">when</span> a syntactically valid expression has
		meaning. In English, for example, "me call Ishmael" is a syntactically valid
		arrangement of words &mdash; it has a subject and a predicate. But
		semantically, it does not make sense. The arrangement "call me Ishmael,"
		however, is both syntactically and semantically valid. The same goes for
		programming languages. In Python, the expression
		<span class="monoText">2.9 * "12"</span> is syntactically valid, but
		semantically invalid. The expression <span class="monoText">2.9 * 12</span>,
		however, is both syntactically and semantically valid. The rules determining
		why the second expression is semantically valid are the programming
		language's <span class="italicsText">static semantics</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even if an expression is both syntactically and static semantically valid,
		it is still subject to the programming language's
		<span class="boldItalics">full semantics</span> &mdash; the rules
		determining <span class="italicsText">what</span> an expression means. In
		English, there is room for ambiguity. For example, consider the famous
		headline: "The British left Waffles on Falklands." The sentence could mean,
		(a) the British left a beloved breakfast food made of batter on the
		Falklands, or (b) the political British left couldn't decide on what do with
		the Falklands. We call this phenomenon
		<span class="boldItalics">syntactic ambiguity</span>. In programming
		languages, there is no such thing. The foundational rule of full semantics
		is that expressions have
		<span class="underlineText">only one</span> meaning. This is always the
		case, whether or not we expect it (a crucial point to remember when we
		execute code and get back strange results).
