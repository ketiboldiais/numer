	<h4>Specifications</h4>
	<p>
		Functions have <span class="boldText">specifications</span>. We can think of
		a specification like a contract between two paries: (a) the function's
		implementer and (b) the function's users. The specification provides two
		things: (1) the function's assumptions, and (2) the function's guarantees.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Assumptions</span> The assumptions are the conditions
		the client must satisfy to use the function. Almost always, the assumptions
		are what values must be used for the function's parameters.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Guarantees</span> The guarantees are the conditions that
		function itself must meet, provided the user has satisfied the assumptions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The functions assumptions and guarantees are made explicit in the function's
		docstring. This is why it is considered best-practic include a docstrig for
		every function we write.
