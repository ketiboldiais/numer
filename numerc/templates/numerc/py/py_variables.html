<h4>Variables in Python</h4>
<p>The way we've connected primitives and operators constitute Python's <span class="italicsText">means of combination</span>. Now we cover Python's <span class="italicsText">means of abstraction</span>.</p>
<p>One means of abstraction is storing values in <span class="boldItalics">variables</span>. A single equal sign (<span class="monoText">=</span>) denotes <span class="boldItalics">assignment</span> of <span class="boldItalics">value</span> to a <span class="boldItalics">variable name</span> (also called an <span class="boldItalics">identifier</span>). For example, the following are all assignments in a <span class="monoText">.py</span> file:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	pi = 3.14159
	pi_approx = 22/7
</code></pre>
<p>Python is an example of a <span class="boldItalics">loosely-typed language</span>. This is in contrast to C, which is a <span class="boldItalics">strongly-typed language</span>. C itself is in contrast to languages like Ada and Pascal, which are often said to be <span class="boldItalics">stringently-typed languages</span>. Pascal in particular has been criticized as having too strong of a type system, making many programming tasks too difficult. On the other end of the spectrum, Python is in contrast to Assembly and Forth, which are <span class="boldItalics">untyped languages</span> &mdash; there are no types, and everything is left to the programmer to ensure that appropriate data types are used.</p>
<p>These distinctions are all based on two factors: (a) whether the language has types, and (b) how much the programmer must use the types explicitly. In C, for example, every variable declaration must be prefaced with the type of data object the variable will store. This is a common characteristic of strongly-typed languages. In languages like Python and JavaScript, however, types do not have to be explicitly used. The types exist, but the programmer is not required to explicitly state them. In other words, the programmer does not bear the burden of specifying what data type is to be used; the language's interpreter or compiler will infer it.</p>
<p>When we assign a value to an identifier, we effectively <span class="italicsText">bind</span> the value to a particular <span class="italicsText">name</span>. In doing so, we store that value in computer memory, which we can access by referencing that value's name:</p>
<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-output=""><code>
	in [1]: pi = 3.14159
	out[1]: 3.14159
	in [2]: pi
	out[2]: 3.14159
</code></pre>
<p>Although the ability to store values in variables may not seem impressive, its benefits cannot be understated. It allows us make our programs <span class="italicsText">modular</span>, treating sections of code like Lego bricks we can use over and over again. We can reuse names, instead of values. This provides two benefits. First, it gives us a short cut: instead of rewriting a computation over and over again, we can just reference that computation's name. Second, it makes our programs easier to read. And when programs are easier to read, changing or debugging them is both faster and less painful. Of course, the second benefit only applies if we give our variables <span class="italicsText">descriptive</span> and <span class="italicsText">concise</span> names. Here is one complex expression in Python:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	pi = 3.14159
	radius = 2.2
	# area of a circle
	area = pi*(radius**2)
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, we've created a complex expression that computes the area of a circle (${A = \pi r^2}$). The pound symbol (<span class="monoText">#</span>) is the way we denote a comment in Python. Notice that the variable names are both descriptive <span class="italicsText">and</span> concise (<span class="monoText">pi</span>, <span class="monoText">radius</span>, and <span class="monoText">area</span>). The variable names could be more concise (e.g., <span class="monoText">p</span>, <span class="monoText">r</span>, and <span class="monoText">a</span>), but doing so would not be descriptive. In general, when we write variable names, we should follow a guideline: <span class="italicsText">Variable names should be descriptive and concise, erring on the side of descriptive.</span></p>
<p>Sidebar: In Python, variable names with spaces are pothole_spaced (using underscores to indicate spaces). This is in contrast to languages like C and Java, where the prevailing convention is camelCasing.</p>
<p>If we wanted to change the radius, say increase it by 1, we would write:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	radius = radius+1
</code></pre>
<p>The code above has a shorthand in Python:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	radius += 1
</code></pre>

<section id="changing_variable_bindings" class="grid-item">
<h5>Changing Variable Bindings</h5>
<p>Name-value bindings are not permanent. We can re-bind variable names using new assignment statements. If we re-bind a variable name using a new assignment statement, the previous value bound to that particular name will no longer be bound to that name. It's probably still stored in memory, but we can no longer access it with the name we gave it. For example:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	radius = 2.2
	radius += 1
</code></pre>
<p>The value bound to <span class="monoText">radius</span> was originally <span class="monoText">2.2</span>. When we wrote <span class="monoText">radius += 1</span>, the value <span class="monoText">2.2</span> is no longer associated with <span class="monoText">radius</span>. Here is a shell session encapsulating these ideas:</p>
<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-output=""><code>
	in [1]: a = 3
	in [2]: a+2.0
	out[2]: 5.0
	in [3]: a = a+1.0
	in [4]: a
	out[4]: 4.0
	in [5]: a = 3
	in [6]: a
	out[6]: 3
	in [7]: b
	NameError: name 'b' is not defined
</code></pre>
</section>


<h5>Swapping Variables</h5>
<p>We must be careful about assigning values to names already bound to values. For example, suppose we wanted to swap certain variables:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	x = 0
	y = 1
	y = x
	x = y
</code></pre>
<p>What exactly does the code above do? We first assigned the integer <span class="monoText">0</span> to the name <span class="monoText">x</span>. Then we assigned the integer <span class="monoText">1</span> to the name <span class="monoText">y</span>. Next, we assigned the variable <span class="monoText">x</span> to the name <span class="monoText">y</span>. The variable <span class="monoText">y</span> now stores the data object <span class="monoText">x</span>, which stores the integer <span class="monoText">0</span>. Thus, <span class="monoText">y = 0</span>. Finally, we assigned the variable <span class="monoText">y</span> to the name <span class="monoText">x</span>. Because <span class="monoText">y = x = 0</span>, we haven't actually swapped anything &mdash; <span class="monoText">x = y = x = 0</span>.</p>
<p>This exercise reveals a crucial point: Assignment is read <span class="underlineText">left to right</span>, and statements are read <span class="underlineText">top to bottom</span> <span class="italicsText">one at a time</span>. A better way to swap the variables above is with the following:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
	x = 1
	y = 2
	temp = y
	y = x
	x = temp
</code></pre>
<p>The sequence above goes as such:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We store the integer <span class="monoText">1</span> to in a variable named <span class="monoText">x</span>.</li>
	<li>We store the integer <span class="monoText">2</span> to in a variable named <span class="monoText">y</span>.</li>
	<li>We store the variable <span class="monoText">y</span> to a temporary variable named <span class="monoText">temp</span> (<span class="monoText">temp = y = 2</span>).</li>
	<li>We store the variable <span class="monoText">x</span> to the variable <span class="monoText">y</span> (<span class="monoText">x = y = 2</span>).</li>
	<li>We store the variable <span class="monoText">temp</span> to the variable <span class="monoText">x</span> (<span class="monoText">x = temp = y = 2</span>).</li>
	<li>The conclusion:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="monoText">y = x = 1</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">x = temp = y = 2</span></li>
	</ul>
</ol>
