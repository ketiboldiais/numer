<h1>Functions: Structuring Programs Well</h1>
<section id="functions_in_java">
	<p>
		With the tools we have thus far, we can create a wide variety of programs.
		But, programs have <span class="italicsText">structure</span>, and there is
		a distinction between
		<span class="italicsText">well-structured programs</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">poorly-structured programs</span>. The most
		obvious characteristics of a well-structured program:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Code is broken down into reusable, testable, and understandable pieces
			(i.e., modular code);
		</li>
		<li>Code combines state and behavior;</li>
		<li>Code is documented concisely and clearly; and</li>
		<li>Code reuses preexisting solutions as much as possible.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		One way to meet the criteria above is with a
		<span class="italicsText">function</span>. Before we consider functions in
		the programming context, let's first recall what a function is in
		mathematics. Both ideas are closely linked. In mathematics, a function is a
		relation that maps one output to one input. For example, the function ${f(x)
		= x^2,}$ a parabolic function, maps values of ${x}$ to a set of outputs,
		${f(x).}$ We say that ${f}$ is the function's name, ${x}$ is the function's
		independent variable (through which inputs are placed), ${f(x)}$ is the
		output, and ${x^2}$ is the function's formula.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of these ideas have corresponding terms in programming. In programming
		generally, ${x}$ is called the <span class="term">parameter</span>, the
		values we place into ${x}$ are called the
		<span class="term">arguments</span>, ${f}$ is the function's
		<span class="term">identifier</span> (or
		<span class="italicsText">name</span>), ${f(x)}$ is the function's
		<span class="term">return value</span>, and ${x^2}$ is the function's
		<span class="term">body</span>.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			In Java, a function is more accurately called a
			<span class="italicsText">method</span>. We will see why in the materials
			on classes. Because we have yet to investigate classes, all of the
			functions in this essay are called
			<span class="italicsText">static methods</span>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		In programming, <span class="term">function</span> is a collection of
		statements aimed at completing a specific task, and whenever such a task
		must be completed, the collection can be reused to complete the task. For
		example, suppose we wanted to compute the average of several values. We can
		write several statements that computes the average, using the values as
		inputs. Instead of writing these statements every time we must compute an
		average, we would write these statements in such a way that they can take
		any quantity of values as inputs. We would then package these statements
		into a &#8220;unit&#8221;, or collection, which can reference anytime we
		must compute an average.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Java, a function, also called a
		<span class="italicsText">subroutine</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">method</span>, takes zero or more inputs (called
		<span class="italicsText">arguments</span>), and produces zero or
		<span class="italicsText">exactly one</span> output. Inside a function are
		the statements that produce output. Thus, a function is effectively a block
		of code, much like the blocks of code we saw with conditional statements.
		That block of code is an instance of
		<span class="italicsText">imperative programming</span> &mdash; structuring
		our program with direct statements to be executed one after another, top to
		bottom &mdash; explicitly commanding the computer how to accomplish a
		particular task. The function, in contrast, is an instance of
		<span class="italicsText">functional programming</span> &mdash; structuring
		our programs by way of functions.
	</p>
	<p>The general syntax for static methods (functions):</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="syntax">
				<li>public static ${returnType}$ ${name}$ (${argType}$ ${p}$) {</li>
				<ul>
					<li>${body}$</li>
					<li>return ${...}$</li>
				</ul>
				<li>}</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the syntax above, the first line is called the function's
		<span class="term">signature</span>. It consists of the keywords
		<span class="monoText">public</span> and
		<span class="monoText">static</span>, because the function is a static
		method (again, we will study these in more detail in the essay on classes).
		Additionally, we have the function's <span class="italicsText">name</span>.
		Following the name is the <span class="italicsText">parameter list</span>,
		<span class="monoText">(${argType}$ ${p}$)</span>, where ${argType}$ is the
		parameter's type, and ${p}$ is the parameter variable. The parameter ${p}$
		carries the inputs to be used in the function's ${body.}$ Inside the
		function's body, we have a
		<span class="italicsText">return statement</span>, which is what transfers
		control back to the caller.

	<p>
		A good function has several characteristics. First, good functions have
		<span class="italicsText">specificity</span>: it should perform one, and
		only one, task, and it should perform it well. Second, they are
		<span class="italicsText">testable</span> &mdash; we can easily determine
		whether it outputs correctly. To ensure this prong is met, a good function
		should perform tasks we already know the outcome of. Third, they are
		<span class="italicsText">reusable</span>: We can use them anywhere in our
		program where we need to accomplish that function's task. Finally, good
		functions are <span class="italicsText">well-documented</span>. The function
		should include a description of what the function does, what inputs it
		takes, and what output it returns. Here is an example of a Java function:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		/**
			* Add two numbers
			*
			* @param firstNum: the first number to add
			* @param secondNum: the second number to add
			* @return the sum of firstNum and secondNum
			*/
			int add(int firstNum, int secondNum) {
				return firstNum + secondNum;
			}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">javadoc.</span> In the code above, we see a block
		comment. This is a special comment in Java, called a
		<span class="boldText">javadoc</span>. As its name suggests, a javadoc
		documents a function. It is structured exactly as it appears in the example.
		It describes what the function does, the function's
		<span class="italicsText">parameters</span> (the inputs the function takes,
		demarcated by the word <span class="monoText">@param</span>), and the
		function's return (the function's output, demarcated by the word
		<span class="monoText">@return</span>). Like all comments, javadocs are
		ignored by the compiler.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematics, we must always be clear about what assumptions we make. The
		same goes for programming &mdash; it is good practice to include in a
		javadoc the assumptions underlying our functions. This will make our
		functions much easier to understand and debug later. For example:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		/**
			* Add two numbers
			*
			* @param firstNum: the first number to add
			* @param secondNum: the second number to add
			* @return the sum of firstNum and secondNum
			*
			* Assumptions:
			*   both addends are integers
			*/
			int add(int firstNum, int secondNum) {
				return firstNum + secondNum;
			}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Function Type.</span> What is not ignored is the
		function declaration thereafter. There are several parts to this function.
		First, we give the function a <span class="italicsText">type</span>. That
		type is the type for the function's output. In this case, this function will
		return an <span class="monoText">int</span>, so we provide the function's
		type as <span class="monoText">int</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Function Name.</span> Next, we give the function a
		<span class="italicsText">name</span>. In this case,
		<span class="monoText">add</span>. This is what we will use to
		<span class="italicsText">call</span>, or
		<span class="italicsText">invoke</span>, the function. The guidelines for
		variable names are applicable here: descriptive, concise, and erring on the
		side of descriptive. They should also be in camelCase. The one distinction:
		Because functions perform a task, their names should be
		<span class="italicsText">verbs</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Parameters.</span> Just after the name, we have a set of
		parentheses, <span class="monoText">(int firstNum, int secondNum)</span>,
		containing what appear to be variable declarations. These are the function's
		<span class="italicsText">parameters</span>. They define what arguments the
		function will take as input. These appear like variable declarations because
		they effectively are. The variables indicated inside the parentheses are
		what will be used inside the function's body.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note, however, that functions need not have parameters. They can simply take
		no arguments. In the example above, the function has two parameters, so it
		takes two arguments. Both those arguments must be of type
		<span class="monoText">int</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic monoText">return.</span> Now we enter the function's
		body. There, we have the keyword <span class="monoText">return</span>. This
		keyword tells Java to output a particular thing. In this case, the result of
		<span class="monoText">firstNum + secondNum</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a crucial point with
		<span class="monoText">return</span> statements: Once Java reaches a
		<span class="monoText">return</span> statement, the entire function halts.
		If there are any other statements after the
		<span class="monoText">return</span> statement, they are
		<span class="underlineText">not</span> executed. Every function must have a
		<span class="monoText">return</span> statement, even if there is no output.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Calling the Function.</span> Once we have defined a
		function, we can <span class="italicsText">call</span> the function in our
		program. When we call the function, if the function has parameters, we
		provide necessary arguments. The code that calls the function is called the
		<span class="italicsText">caller</span>. Once Java reaches the caller, the
		caller will halt momentarily, and Java goes to the
		<span class="italicsText">callee</span> &mdash; the code defining the
		function. The caller waits as Java executes the function. Once the function
		returns with an output (if any), Java goes back to the caller with that
		output, and the caller continues.
	</p>
	<p>
		What the caller does with that output is up to the programmer. We can save
		the output by assigning it to a variable, use it like a literal, or simply
		ignore it. For example:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		static int add(int firstNum, int secondNum) {
			return firstNum + secondNum;
		}

		System.out.println("Just before the first call");
		int result = add(9, 1);
		System.out.println(result);
		System.out.println(add(2, 3));
		int bigResult = add(10, 20) + add(30, 40) + 50;
		System.out.println(bigResult);
		add(4, 6);
		System.out.println("No more calls");
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Just before the first call
		10
		5
		150
		No more calls
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		For now, ignore the word <span class="monoText">static</span>. We will
		return to this word later. The crucial point is that the function works as
		expected. Observe the various ways we can use the function. The last call
		&mdash; <span class="monoText">add(4, 6)</span> &mdash; will compile, but
		its output will simply become a garbage value. If you are curious, about the
		code above, it was compiled in Java with the following program:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		public class MyClass {
			public static void main(String args[]) {
				System.out.println("Just before the first call");
				int result = add(9, 1);
				System.out.println(result);
				System.out.println(add(2, 3));
				int bigResult = add(10, 20) + add(30, 40) + 50;
				System.out.println(bigResult);
				add(4, 6);
				System.out.println("No more calls");
			}
			
			static int add(int firstNum, int secondNum) {
				return firstNum + secondNum;
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Again, ignore these details. We will address them in due time. If a function
		has $n$ parameters, we <span class="underlineText">must</span> provide
		exactly $n$ arguments. Failing to do so will lead to errors:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		static int add(int firstNum, int secondNum) {
			return firstNum + secondNum;
		}

		int result = add(9);
		System.out.println(result);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		required: int,int
		found: int
		reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
		1 error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This error directly tells us that we failed to give all the required
		arguments. Similarly, if we give too many arguments:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		static int add(int firstNum, int secondNum) {
			return firstNum + secondNum;
		}

		int result = add(9, 10, 11);
		System.out.println(result);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		required: int,int
		found: int,int,int
		reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
		1 error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Functions are what allow us to
		<span class="boldText">decompose</span> programs &mdash; we take a problem,
		and break it down into smaller pieces that can be solved with commands. Some
		of those commands are built into Java, but most are not. When we write
		functions, we are essentially creating a new command we can use in Java.
