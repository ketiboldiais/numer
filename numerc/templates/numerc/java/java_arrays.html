<h1>Arrays</h1>
<section id="java_arrays">
	<p>
		In the preceding sections, the data we used were
		<span class="italicsText">single</span> data values. These values are
		represented by single numbers (integers or floats), truth values (true and
		false), and characters (ASCII or Unicode encodings). What if want to
		<span class="italicsText">multiple</span> values? After all, data does not
		just consist of single data values. A single character does not make a
		novel, nor does a single temperature make a weather forecast. More often
		than not, our use of data involves multiple data values.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every piece of text we see on a computer is called a
		<span class="boldText">string</span> in computer science. All strings are a
		sequence of <span class="monoText">char</span> values. And since
		<span class="monoText">char</span> values are just a unique sequence of
		numbers, text is just a sequence of numbers to a computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The concept of a sequence implies its
		<span class="italicsText">elements</span> are meaningfully
		<span class="italicsText">ordered</span>. If we scrutinized this fact, we'd
		realize that there are numerous data that require ordering. DNA, for
		example, consists of ordered bases. Time series data consists of
		measurements taken at regular intervals (e.g., temperatures, stock prices,
		pandemic deaths). Elton John's
		<span class="italicsText">Bennie and the Jets</span> on Spotify consists of
		ordered air pressure measurements. All of these are data consisting of
		multiple data values ordered meaningfully.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Arrays.</span> How do we store all of this data? Through
		<span class="boldText">arrays</span>. A Java array is a variable
		representing a series of zero or more values of the
		<span class="italicsText">same</span> type. More specifically, an array is a
		<span class="boldText">data structure</span> that places, or arranges,
		values in order, one after another.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because arrays place values in order, each value inside an array has a place
		or position in the array, called its <span class="boldText">index</span>.
		That index is broadly referred to as
		<span class="boldText">metadata</span> &mdash; data about the relationship
		between the value stored and the data structure. Metadata is critical to a
		data structure. For arrays, the metadata is
		<span class="italicsText">index</span>. If we took that metadata away, the
		array would no longer be ordered &mdash; Bach would sound like white noise
		and Hemmingway would look like ASCII splatter. Moreover, given that the
		index tells us what a particular value's position is in the array, we can
		access a specific value inside the array using its index.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Declaring Arrays.</span> Like any other variable, arrays
		have a <span class="italicsText">name</span> and a
		<span class="italicsText">type</span>. The difference, however, is the way
		we declare them. To do so, we include brackets after the type, rather than
		just the type:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// This is a single int variable named integer
		int integer; 

		// This is an array of integers 
		int[] multipleIntegers;

		// A single character
		char letter;

		// An array of characters
		char[] word;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Initializing Arrays.</span> When an array is merely
		declared, it is empty. To fill it with values, we
		<span class="underlineText">must</span> tell Java how many
		<span class="boldText">elements</span> &mdash; the individual data values
		&mdash; it will take. The number of elements an array stores is the array's
		<span class="boldText">length</span> &mdash; the
		<span class="italicsText">size</span> of the array. That size
		<span class="underlineText">cannot be changed</span> once the array is
		initialized. Once an array is initialized, it has a set length, and we can
		access that length with the <span class="monoText">.length</span> property.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// An array of 8 integers named multipleIntegers
		int[] multipleIntegers = new int[8];

		// An array of characters named word
		char[] word;
		// Initialize word to hold 4 characters
		word = new char[4];

		System.out.println(multipleIntegers.length);
		System.out.println(word.length);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		8
		4
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note the two ways we can use to initialize an array. We can first declare
		the array, then indicate its size, or, we can write it all in one line. We
		can also initialize an array by directly assigning values to the array in a
		single line:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// An array of integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
		int[] integerSequence = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };

		// An array of characters 'j','a','v','a'
		char[] word = { 'j', 'a', 'v', 'a' };

		System.out.println(integerSequence.length);
		System.out.println(word.length);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		5
		4
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Observe the difference between Java and many other languages: We assign
		values to an array with curly braces, <span class="monoText">{}</span>,
		rather than square brackets. Notice also that we do not explicitly provide a
		size in the initialization method above. This is because Java will
		automatically count how many elements are in the assignment when we
		initialize in this manner, producing the array's
		<span class="monoText">.length</span> property.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Accessing Specific Values in an Array.</span> Once an
		array is initialized and values are assigned to it, we can access the
		individual values in the array with
		<span class="italicsText">bracket syntax</span>. Inside that bracket, we
		pass the integer representing our sought value's index:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		char[] word = {'j', 'a', 'v', 'a'}; 
		
		System.out.println(word.length);
		System.out.println(word[0]);
		System.out.println(word[1]);
		System.out.println(word[2]);
		System.out.println(word[3]);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		4
		j
		a
		v
		a
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice that the array <span class="monoText">word</span> has a length of
		<span class="monoText">4</span>, but the last element in the array has an
		index of <span class="monoText">3</span>. This is because the first element
		in an array has <span class="monoText">index = 0</span>. In computer
		science, we almost always count starting from
		<span class="monoText">0</span> (we say almost always because some
		programming languages count from 1; e.g., Smalltalk, COBOL, Julia, Matlab,
		Mathematica, etc.). This means that, if an array has, say, 10 elements, then
		the first element has an index of 0, and the last element has an index of 9.
		Thus, in such an array, an index we pass is valid if, and only if, that
		index is 0, 9, or an integer in between 0 and 9.
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Java Rule.</span> Given an array of size ${n}$
			containing elements, each element has an index ${i,}$ where ${0 \leq i <
			n.}$ The <span class="italicsText">first</span> element of the array has
			the index ${i = 0,}$ and the <span class="italicsText">last</span> element
			of the array has the index ${i = n - 1.}$
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Because the array index is just an integer value, we can insert code into
		the square brackets of a particular array to obtain a value therein, so long
		as the code returns a nonnegative <span class="monoText">int</span> value
		and such value is a valid index:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int[] nums = {0, 1, 2};
		
		system.out.println(nums.length - 1);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		2
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		When we initialize arrays by declaring and assigning values to the array in
		a single statement, we must be sure to include the square brackets. Failing
		to do so will lead to an error:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int oddNumberSequence = {1, 3, 5, 7};

		System.out.println(oddNumberSequence[0]);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		HelloWorld.java:5: error: illegal initializer for int
		int oddNumberSequence = {1, 3, 5, 7};
										^
		HelloWorld.java:7: error: array required, but int found
		System.out.println(oddNumberSequence[0]);
														^
		2 errors
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Replacing Values in an Array.</span> The square bracket
		syntax also allows us to replace
		<span class="italicsText">existing</span> values in an array:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		char[] name = {'j', 'o', 'h', 'n'};
		System.out.println(name[2]);
		
		name[2] = 'a';
		System.out.println(name[2]);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		h
		a
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Invalid Indices.</span> In Java, indices can only be
		nonnegative integers less than the array's size. If we try to pass an
		invalid index (an index that does not satisfy the rule stated above), we
		will get an error:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// an array of size 4
		int[] primeSequence = {2, 3, 5, 7};

		System.out.println(primeSequence[4]);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 4
				at HelloWorld.main(HelloWorld.java:7)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In programming parlance, this is a <span class="boldText">crash</span>. The
		program completely failed to execute.
