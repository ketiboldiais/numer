	<h4>Variable Scope in Java</h4>
	<p>
		As we saw with conditional statements, blocks of code in Java are a set of
		statements. They are enclosed by braces:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		if (...) {
			// a block of code
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		A block of code is essentially a &#8220;mini&#8221; program inside a bigger
		program. And because they are effectively sub-programs, there are rules
		about what we can and cannot do inside or outside blocks of code. In
		particular: Variables declared <span class="italicsText">inside</span> the
		block are not visible <span class="italicsText">outside</span> the block.
		Once we leave the block of code, Java can no longer see that variable
		&mdash; the variable is no longer available for us to access. It is only
		accessible inside the block.
	</p>
	<p>
		Inversely, if a variable is declared
		<span class="italicsText">outside</span> a block, then the variable is
		visible <span class="italicsText">inside</span> the block. If we declare a
		variable outside the block, then Java can see that variable inside the
		block.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int outsideBlock = 1
		if (true) {
			int insideBlock = 10;
			System.out.println(outsideBlock);
		}
		System.out.println(insideBlock);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Line 6: error: cannot find symbol
		System.out.println(inside);
								^
		symbol:   variable inside
		1 error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We get an error because we are telling Java to print the value assigned to a
		variable it cannot see. Once we left the
		<span class="monoText">if</span> statement's block &mdash;
		<span class="monoText">insideBlock</span>'s
		<span class="italicsText">enclosing block</span> (also called
		<span class="italicsText">enclosing scope</span>) &mdash;
		<span class="monoText">insideBlock</span> no longer exists for all intents
		and purposes. However, we can still access
		<span class="monoText">outsideBlock</span> because it exists outside the
		<span class="monoText">if</span> statement's block:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int outsideBlock = 1
		if (true) {
			int insideBlock = 10;
			System.out.println(outsideBlock);
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		1
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Scope is precisely why programming languages require, or encourage,
		indentation. Assuming we follow proper indentation like the examples above,
		the general rule of thumb is: We
		<span class="underlineText">can</span> access variables &#8220;to the
		left&#8221; or on the same level; we
		<span class="underlineText">cannot</span> access variables &#8220;to the
		right.&#8221; (Where the directions are relative to the start of the line).
