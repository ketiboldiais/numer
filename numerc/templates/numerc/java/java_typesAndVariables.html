<h1>Terminology</h1>
<section id="types_and_variables_in_java">
	<h2>Variables</h2>
	<p>
		Programs need data. To give our programs that data, they must be stored
		somewhere in memory. But before we store any data in Java, we must tell Java
		beforehand that you are going to store data. To do so, we need
		<span class="term">variables</span> &mdash; an entity that holds a data-type
		value. In Java, every variable has a <span class="term">name</span> and a
		<span class="term">type</span>. In the example below, there are
		<span class="italicsText">comments</span>, denoted by two forward slashes
		(<span class="monoText">//</span>). Every other statement is called a
		<span class="term">declaration</span>. The left side is the variable's
		<span class="term">type</span>, and the right side the variable's
		<span class="term">name</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// Declare variable named c of type char
		char c;

		// Declare variable named num of type int
		int num;

		// Declare variable named isPresent of type boolean  
		boolean isPresent;
	</code></pre>

	<p>Simply put, variable declaration is the act of creating a variable.</p>
</section>

<section id="constants">
	<h2>Constants</h2>
	<p>
		Variables fall into two categories: (1) variables, and (2) constants. In
		languages like Java, the values we store in a variable can be mutated.
		Accordingly, the term variable, on its own, usually implies that the value
		stored in the variable can be mutated (again, in the context of Java; some
		languages do not permit such mutation). When we use the term
		<span class="italicsText">constant</span>, however, we are referring to a
		variable whose stored value <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> be
		changed.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="naming">
	<h2>Naming</h2>
	<p>
		A
		<span class="term">name</span>, or more formally, an
		<span class="term">identifier</span>, is a sequence of characters in source
		code used to label a particular entity (for example, a variable). In Java,
		names must begin with either Unicode letters and digits, the dollar sign
		(<span class="monoText">$</span>), or the underscore (<span class="monoText"
			>_</span
		>). By convention, however, names should always begin with a letter. Names
		in Java also follow camelCasing (capitalizing every other word to indicate
		spacing), rather than pothole_casing (using underscores to indicating
		spacing). The exception to this convention is with constants &mdash; very
		letter in a constant should be in upper case, with spaces indicated by
		undercores. Finally, Java places heavy emphasis on
		<span class="underlineText">descriptive</span> and
		<span class="underlineText">concise</span> variable names, erring on the
		side of <span class="underlineText">descriptive</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// This is good
		int age = 22;

		// These are good
		int NUM_ATTENDEES = 87;
		boolean ATTENDED = true;

		// This is bad
		float $pi = 3.14;

	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In general, there are three guidelines we should follow when creating
		variable names:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The variable name should describe the data stored in the variable.</li>
		<li>
			Our code is read more times than it is written (whether by ourselves or
			others). Our priority should be &#8220;easy to understand,&#8221; not
			&#8220;easy to write.&#8221;
		</li>
		<li>
			If there are standard conventions, follow them; else, create a name and be
			consistent.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Additionally, like any other programming language, there are certain words
		we cannot use as names in Java. These are called
		<span class="term">reserved words</span>:
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			abstract, assert
			boolean, break, byte
			case, catch, char, class, const, continue
			default, do, double
			else, extends
			false, final, finally, float, for
			goto
			if, implements, import, instanceof, int, interface
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			long
			native, new, null
			package, private, protected, public
			return
			short, static, strictfp, super, switch, synchronized
			this, throw, throws, transient, true, try
			void, volatile, while
		</code></pre>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="declaration">
	<h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
	<p>
		With few exceptions relating to scope &mdash; in Java, once you have
		declared a variable name of a particular type, you cannot redeclare it later
		down the program:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// Declare variable named c of type char
		char c;

		// Variable is already declared, this will return an error
		char c;

		// This also won't work, even if it's of different type
		int c;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Even if the last example worked, it would be a stark example of
		<span class="italicsText">dirty code</span>, poor programming hygiene. How
		will our future selves or other coders tell the two apart?
	</p>
</section>

<section id="comments">
	<h2>Comments</h2>
	<p>
		As mentioned previously, comments in Java are indicated by two forward
		slashes (<span class="monoText">//</span>). Everything indicated as a
		comment will not be executed. In Java, there are two types of comments:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// This is an inline comment, it starts with //

		/*
			* This is a block, or multiline, comment. It starts with /* 
			* and ends with 
		*/
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="java_types">
	<h2>Types in Java</h2>
	<p>
		As mentioned earlier, every data type in Java has a type. Whenever we
		declare a variable in Java, we must explicitly state the variable's type.
		This is an instruction to the compiler that the particular variable will
		store a value of a particular type. We will see later why Java's designers
		decided to implement this feature.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, once we declare a variable to be of a particular type, that variable's
		type can never change. For example, when write
		<span class="monoText">int x;</span> the variable
		<span class="monoText">x</span> will always store some value of type
		<span class="monoText">int</span>. That value may change later, but the
		variable's type <span class="monoText">int</span> can never be changed to
		<span class="monoText">double</span> or <span class="monoText">char</span>.
		Because of this trait &mdash; the prohibition of changing a variable's type
		after declaration &mdash; Java is described as a
		<span class="term">statically-typed language</span> (i.e., the language's
		types are &#8220;static&#8221;).
		<label for="typeCheck" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="typeCheck" class="margin-toggle" />
		<span class="marginnote"
			>The other end of the spectrum are the
			<span class="term">dynamically-typed languages</span> like JavaScript; in
			these languages, a variable can store an integer, then later store a
			Boolean, then later store a string. Furthermore, type checking is done at
			runtime &mdash; <span class="term">dynamic type checking</span>.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever we compile Java source code, the
		<span class="monoText">javac</span> compiler will check all of our source
		code to ensure we are complying with Java's type-checking rules. Because
		type checking is done at compile time, we say that Java employs a
		<span class="term">static type checking</span> system.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Java, there are eight
		<span class="term">primitive data types</span>. All other data in Java is
		represented by some combination of these eight primitive types. The types
		fall into four broad categories:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol>
				<li>integers</li>
				<li>floating point numbers</li>
				<li>text</li>
				<li>boolean</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<!--* Integers  -->
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Integers.</span> Integers are the whole numbers and
		their negative counterparts (e.g., 0, 5, -11, 27, etc.). In Java, these
		numbers can be represented by any one of these four types:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		byte
		short
		int
		long
	</code></pre>

	<!--* Floats -->
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Floating Point Numbers.</span> Floating point numbers
		are those numbers with fractional parts, or decimal points (i.e., 0.0, 12.9,
		3.14, -1.29, etc.) We can represent these numbers with any one of these two
		types:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		float pi = 3.14;
		double e = 0.577;
	</code></pre>

	<!--* Textual Data -->
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Text.</span> There are two ways to represent textual
		data in Java: with the primitive type <span class="monoText">char</span> or
		with the abstract data type <span class="monoText">String</span>. We will
		investigate what the differences between a primitive type and an abstract
		data type are in later sections, but for now, it suffices to understand that
		<span class="monoText">char</span> is a primitive, but
		<span class="monoText">String</span> is not.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <span class="monoText">char</span> type represents individual
		alphanumeric characters for symbols. There are ${2^16}$ different possible
		<span class="monoText">char</span> values; this includes letters, numbers,
		symbols, and whitespace characters like single-space, tab, and newline.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		char x = 'x';
		String n = "Hello";
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The <span class="monoText">String</span> type represents
		<span class="underlineText">sequences</span> of characters. In Java, we
		denote strings by enclosing a sequence of characters in double quotes.
	</p>

	<!--* Boolean -->
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Boolean.</span> Boolean values are the binary values
		<span class="monoText">true</span> and <span class="monoText">false</span>.
		These are the only two values under the type.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		boolean a = true;
		boolean b = false;
	</code></pre>
	<p>With just these eight types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="monoText">byte, short, int, long</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">float, double</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">char</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">boolean</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>we can represent any data that a computer can work with.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Initialization.</span> Once we have declared a variable,
		we can assign it data. In doing so, we
		<span class="term">initialize</span> the variable (we give the variable an
		<span class="italicsText">initial</span> value):
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// declaration
		float increment;

		// initialization
		increment = 0.1;

		// inline-initialization: declare and initialize in one line
		boolean isItSnowing = false;
		long weightBlueWhale = 330000;  
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the example above, notice that we can declare and initialize variables in
		one line. This is called <span class="term">inline-initialization</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (<span
			class="monoText"
			>;</span
		>). Like C, Java is a
		<span class="term">semicolon-delimited language</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To use variables in Java, they <span class="underlineText">must</span> be
		initialized:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		double x;
		System.out.println(x);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Line 3: error: variable x might not have been initialized
		System.out.println(x);
											^
		1 error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">literal</span> is the Java source code representation
		of a data-type value. The number or value we explicitly assign to a variable
		is called a literal. In programs, there are values that change as the
		program runs; an <span class="italicsText">incrementer</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">accumulator</span>, for example. Literals are
		those values that are not computed; they are explicitly written. They might
		be manipulated, but the value we explicitly wrote always appears directly in
		our source code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The opposite of a literal is an <span class="term">expression</span>. An
		expression is a combination of literals, variables, and operations that Java
		must <span class="underlineText">evaluate</span> to produce a single value.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// These are literals
		char tic = 'x';
		char tac = 'o'; 

		// Note the L suffix; this is how we tell Java that this is big number
		long bigNum = 10000L;

		boolean isComplete = true;
		boolean isIncomplete = false;

		// These are expressions, not a literal
		int foo = 1 + 1;
		long biggerNum = bigNum + 10000L;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Modifying Variables.</span> Once a value is assigned to
		a variable, we can modify it as the program runs:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int changing = 10; 

		changing = 20; // assign a new value

		changing = 20 + 20; // Arithmetic is ok right of =

		changing += 1; // Add 1, assign it the result

		changing -= 1; // Subtract 1, assign it the result

		changing *= 2; // Multiply by 2, assign it the result

		changing /= 2; // Divide by 2, assign it the result 
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We can also modify variables by assigning existing variables. Always read
		assignments from right to left:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		double first = 10.0;
		double second = 5.0;
		first = second // assignment, right to left
		second = 20.0;
		first = second + 10.0;
		double third = 2.0;
		first = second + third; // arithmetic with variables on right is ok

		int z = 10;
		z = z + 1; // z is now 11
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The last example reveals a crucial point about assignment, and why we want
		to always read them from right to left. The value assigned to
		<span class="monoText">z</span> at the very last line is first computed
		&mdash; <span class="monoText">z + 1</span> &mdash; then assigned. The value
		stored in <span class="monoText">z</span> when
		<span class="monoText">z + 1</span> is computed is
		<span class="monoText">10</span>, so the value assigned to
		<span class="monoText">z</span> at the very last line is
		<span class="monoText">11</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Type Safety.</span> Once we declare a variable in that
		variable must maintain its type. We cannot, say, declare a variable
		<span class="monoText">num</span> of type <span class="monoText">int</span>,
		and thereafter assign to it data of type
		<span class="monoText">float</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int num = 10;
		num = 10.0; # error is returned for this
	</code></pre>
	<p>Failure to remember this rule can lead to unexpected results:</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int num = 35;
		num /= 2;
		System.out.println(num);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		11
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The correct answer to the above should be ${11.\overline{6}.}$ (The
		overline, called a <span class="italicsText">vinculum</span>, indicates
		repeating digits). We're getting <span class="monoText">11</span> because
		<span class="monoText">num</span> was declared to store data of type
		<span class="monoText">int</span>. Note that there is no rounding occurring
		here. Java is simply dropping the fractional digits.
	</p>
	<p>Note that Strings in Java must be enclosed in double quotes:</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		System.out.println("Hello, world!'); // causes an error
		System.out.println("Hello, world!"); // no error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why &#8220;Primitive&#8221; Type?</span> The eight types
		above are referred to as &#8220;primitive&#8221; types because they can all
		be represented by numbers. The numeric data types
		<span class="monoText">byte, short, int, long, float, double</span> can
		obviously all be represented by numbers. But what about
		<span class="monoText">char</span> and
		<span class="monoText">boolean</span>? Well,
		<span class="monoText">boolean</span> is simply a binary value &mdash; we
		can represent <span class="monoText">false</span> with
		<span class="monoText">0</span> and <span class="monoText">true</span> with
		<span class="monoText">1</span>. <span class="monoText">char</span> is more
		interesting. In programming, English characters have a corresponding numeric
		code called an <span class="term">ASCII code</span>, found in the ASCII
		table. Because each letter is encoded in ASCII with numbers, they too can be
		represented as numbers. ASCII has generally gone along the wayside, replaced
		by the much larger UNICODE enconding system. This is due to ASCII encoding
		only English characters &mdash; obviously English isn't the only language we
		speak. UNICODE encodes a large set of characters, from
		&#x627;&#x644;&#x641;&#x628;&#x627;&#x6CC;
		&#x641;&#x627;&#x631;&#x633;&#x6CC; to &#129313;.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why are there so many types?</span> Like C, Java
		provides a variety of types to manage memory. Each of the types takes up a
		certain amount of memory. Below is a table:
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>Java Primitive Type</th>
				<th>Bytes Required</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">boolean</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">1 byte</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">byte</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">char</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">2 bytes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">short</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">int</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">4 bytes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">float</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">long</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">8 bytes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">double</span></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>
	<p>
		These memory usages are crucial to keep in mind when working with data.
		Failing to recall them can lead to unexpected results:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		byte num = 10;
		num += 256;
		System.out.println(num);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		10
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Why isn't the console displaying <span class="monoText">356</span>? Because
		the type <span class="monoText">byte</span> is restricted to exactly 1 byte
		&mdash; it can only store integers up to 256.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Arithmetic Operator Precedence.</span> Operators are
		evaluated in a specific order. Parentheses are always evaluated first.
		Inside the parentheses or otherwise, operators are evaluated left-to-right.
		Going from left to right, multiplication (<span class="monoText">*</span>)
		and modulus (<span class="monoText">%</span>) are evaluated before addition
		(<span class="monoText">+</span>) and subtraction (<span class="monoText"
			>-</span
		>).
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Modulus Operator.</span> Many computer science newcomers
		are unfamiliar with the modulus operator. This operator simply returns the
		remainder from dividing some number $a$ by ${b.}$ This is a particularly
		useful operation. With it, we can check several things. For example, if ${a
		\bmod 2}$ returns a remainder of 0, then we know that $a$ is an even number.
		If ${a \bmod 2}$ returns a remainder greater than 0, then we know that $a$
		is an odd number. The modulus is also helpful for obtaining the last $x$
		digits of a particular squence of numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Strongly-typed v. Weakly-typed Languages</span> In many
		languages, like Python and JavaScript, we, the programmers, are not required
		to explicitly state what types our data are. These are called
		<span class="italicsText">weakly-typed languages</span>. Java and C,
		however, are <span class="italicsText">strongly-typed</span> languages
		&mdash; we must explicitly provide a datum's type. The benefit of
		strongly-typed languages: It forces us to specify how much space we need to
		store data. This means we have no choice but to be efficient. Moreover, it
		helps us catch some of the most common programming errors.

<section id="kinds_of_variables">
	<h2>Kinds of Variables</h2>
	<p>
		There are different kinds of variables in Java. Variables that store
		primitive type values are called
		<span class="term">primitive variables</span> (or,
		<span class="term">primitive constants</span>). Variables that store objects
		are called <span class="term">object references</span>. With an object
		reference, the variable doesn't actually hold the object &mdash; it instead
		holds a reference to the object.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="library_methods_and_apis">
	<h2>Library Methods & APIs</h2>
	<p>In the examples above, we wrote the following:</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		System.out.print(/* some expression or value */)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This is a <span class="term">library method</span> &mdash; a method provided

		mathematics, printing, input and output, etc. Because of how many library
		methods there are, we will not list and explain them all at once. Instead,
