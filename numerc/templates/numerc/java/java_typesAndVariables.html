	<h3>Types and Variables in Java</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Declarations</span>. Programs need data. To give our
		programs that data, they must be stored somewhere in memory. But before we
		store any data in Java, we must tell Java beforehand that you are going to
		store data. To do so, we need <span class="boldItalics">variables</span>. In
		Java, every variable has a <span class="boldItalics">name</span> and a
		<span class="boldItalics">type</span>. In the example below, there are
		<span class="italicsText">comments</span>, denoted by two forward slashes
		(<span class="monoText">//</span>). Every other statement is called a
		<span class="boldItalics">declaration</span>. The left side is the
		variable's <span class="boldItalics">type</span>, and the right side the
		variable's <span class="boldItalics">name</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// Declare variable named c of type char
		char c;

		// Declare variable named num of type int
		int num;

		// Declare variable named isPresent of type boolean  
		boolean isPresent;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Names in Java</span>. In Java, names must begin with
		either Unicode letters and digits, the dollar sign (<span class="monoText"
			>$</span
		>), or the underscore (<span class="monoText">_</span>). By convention,
		however, names should always begin with a letter. Names in Java also follow
		camelCasing (capitalizing every other word to indicate spacing), rather than
		pothole_casing (using underscores to indicating spacing). The exception to
		this convention is with constants &mdash; very letter in a constant should
		be in upper case, with spaces indicated by undercores. Finally, Java places
		heavy emphasis on <span class="underlineText">descriptive</span> and
		<span class="underlineText">concise</span> variable names, erring on the
		side of <span class="underlineText">descriptive</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// This is good
		int age = 22;

		// These are good
		int NUM_ATTENDEES = 87;
		boolean ATTENDED = true;

		// This is bad
		float $pi = 3.14;

	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In general, there are three guidelines we should follow when creating
		variable names:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The variable name should describe the data stored in the variable.</li>
		<li>
			Our code is read more times than it is written (whether by ourselves or
			others). Our priority should be &#8220;easy to understand,&#8221; not
			&#8220;easy to write.&#8221;
		</li>
		<li>
			If there are standard conventions, follow them; else, create a name and be
			consistent.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Additionally, like any other programming language, there are certain words
		we cannot use as names in Java. These are called
		<span class="boldItalics">reserved words</span>:
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			abstract, assert
			boolean, break, byte
			case, catch, char, class, const, continue
			default, do, double
			else, extends
			false, final, finally, float, for
			goto
			if, implements, import, instanceof, int, interface
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			long
			native, new, null
			package, private, protected, public
			return
			short, static, strictfp, super, switch, synchronized
			this, throw, throws, transient, true, try
			void, volatile, while
		</code></pre>
	</div>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Redeclaring Variables</span>. With few exceptions
		relating to scope &mdash; in Java, once you have declared a variable name of
		a particular type, you cannot redeclare it later down the program:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// Declare variable named c of type char
		char c;

		// Variable is already declared, this will return an error
		char c;

		// This also won't work, even if it's of different type
		int c;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Even if the last example worked, it would be a stark example of
		<span class="italicsText">dirty code</span>, poor programming hygiene. How
		will our future selves or other coders tell the two apart?
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Comments in Java</span>. As mentioned previously,
		comments in Java are indicated by two forward slashes (<span
			class="monoText"
			>//</span
		>). Everything indicated as a comment will not be executed. In Java, there
		are two types of comments:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// This is an inline comment, it starts with //

		/*
			* This is a block, or multiline, comment. It starts with /* 
			* and ends with 
		*/
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Types in Java</span>. In Java, there are eight
		<span class="boldItalics">primitive data types</span>. All other data in
		Java is represented by some combination of these eight primitive types. The
		types fall into four broad categories:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>integers</li>
		<li>floating point numbers</li>
		<li>text</li>
		<li>boolean</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Integers</span>. Integers are the whole numbers and
		their negative counterparts (e.g., 0, 5, -11, 27, etc.). In Java, these
		numbers can be represented by any one of these four types:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		byte
		short
		int
		long
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Floating Point Numbers</span>. Floating point numbers,
		or real numbers, are those numbers with fractional parts, or decimal points
		(i.e., 0.0, 12.9, 3.14, -1.29, etc.) We can represent these numbers with any
		one of these two types:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		float
		double
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Text</span>. Text is represented in Java with a single
		data type:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		char
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Boolean</span>. Boolean values are the binary values
		<span class="monoText">true</span> and <span class="monoText">false</span>.
		These are the only two values under the type:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		boolean
	</code></pre>
	<p>With just these eight types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="monoText">byte, short, int, long</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">float, double</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">char</span></li>
		<li><span class="monoText">boolean</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>we can represent any data that a computer can work with.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Initialization</span>. Once we have declared a variable,
		we can assign it data. In doing so, we
		<span class="boldItalics">initialize</span> the variable (we give the
		variable an <span class="italicsText">initial</span> value):
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		float increment = 0.1;
		boolean isItSnowing = false;
		long weightBlueWhale = 330000;  
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (<span
			class="monoText"
			>;</span
		>). Like C, Java is a
		<span class="boldItalics">semicolon-delimited language</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To use variables in Java, they <span class="underlineText">must</span> be
		initialized:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		double x;
		System.out.println(x);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Line 3: error: variable x might not have been initialized
		System.out.println(x);
											^
		1 error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The number or value we explicitly assign to a variable is called a
		<span class="boldItalics">literal</span>. In programs, there are values that
		change as the program runs. An
		<span class="italicsText">incrementer</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">accumulator</span>, for example. Literals are
		those values that do not change. They might be manipulated, but the value we
		explicitly wrote always appears directly in our source code.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// These are literals
		char tic = 'x';
		char tac = 'o'; 

		// Note the L suffix; this is how we tell Java that this is big number
		long bigNum = 10000L;

		boolean isComplete = true;
		boolean isIncomplete = false;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Modifying Variables</span>. Once a value is assigned to
		a variable, we can modify it as the program runs:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int changing = 10; 

		changing = 20; // assign a new value

		changing = 20 + 20; // Arithmetic is ok right of =

		changing += 1; // Add 1, assign it the result

		changing -= 1; // Subtract 1, assign it the result

		changing *= 2; // Multiply by 2, assign it the result

		changing /= 2; // Divide by 2, assign it the result 
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We can also modify variables by assigning existing variables. Always read
		assignments from right to left:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		double first = 10.0;
		double second = 5.0;
		first = second // assignment, right to left
		second = 20.0;
		first = second + 10.0;
		double third = 2.0;
		first = second + third; // arithmetic with variables on right is ok

		int z = 10;
		z = z + 1; // z is now 11
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The last example reveals a crucial point about assignment, and why we want
		to always read them from right to left. The value assigned to
		<span class="monoText">z</span> at the very last line is first computed
		&mdash; <span class="monoText">z + 1</span> &mdash; then assigned. The value
		stored in <span class="monoText">z</span> when
		<span class="monoText">z + 1</span> is computed is
		<span class="monoText">10</span>, so the value assigned to
		<span class="monoText">z</span> at the very last line is
		<span class="monoText">11</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Type Maintenance</span>. Once we declare a variable in
		that variable must maintain its type. We cannot, say, declare a variable
		<span class="monoText">num</span> of type <span class="monoText">int</span>,
		and thereafter assign to it data of type
		<span class="monoText">float</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int num = 10;
		num = 10.0; # error is returned for this
	</code></pre>
	<p>Failure to remember this rule can lead to unexpected results:</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int num = 35;
		num /= 2;
		System.out.println(num);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		11
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The correct answer to the above should be ${11.\overline{6}.}$ (The
		overline, called a <span class="italicsText">vinculum</span>, indicates
		repeating digits). We're getting <span class="monoText">11</span> because
		<span class="monoText">num</span> was declared to store data of type
		<span class="monoText">int</span>. Note that there is no rounding occurring
		here. Java is simply dropping the fractional digits.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="boldText monoText">string</span>. Strings in Java script must
		be enclosed in double quotes:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		System.out.println("Hello, world!'); // causes an error
		System.out.println("Hello, world!"); // no error
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why &#8220;Primitive&#8221; Type?</span> The eight types
		above are referred to as &#8220;primitive&#8221; types because they can all
		be represented by numbers. The numeric data types
		<span class="monoText">byte, short, int, long, float, double</span> can
		obviously all be represented by numbers. But what about
		<span class="monoText">char</span> and
		<span class="monoText">boolean</span>? Well,
		<span class="monoText">boolean</span> is simply a binary value &mdash; we
		can represent <span class="monoText">false</span> with
		<span class="monoText">0</span> and <span class="monoText">true</span> with
		<span class="monoText">1</span>. <span class="monoText">char</span> is more
		interesting. In programming, English characters have a corresponding numeric
		code called an <span class="boldItalics">ASCII code</span>, found in the
		ASCII table. Because each letter is encoded in ASCII with numbers, they too
		can be represented as numbers. ASCII has generally gone along the wayside,
		replaced by the much larger UNICODE enconding system. This is due to ASCII
		encoding only English characters &mdash; obviously English isn't the only
		language we speak. UNICODE encodes a large set of characters, from
		&#x627;&#x644;&#x641;&#x628;&#x627;&#x6CC;
		&#x641;&#x627;&#x631;&#x633;&#x6CC; to &#129313;.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why are there so many types?</span> Like C, Java
		provides a variety of types to manage memory. Each of the types takes up a
		certain amount of memory. Below is a table:
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<th>Java Primitive Type</th>
				<th>Bytes Required</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">boolean</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">1 byte</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">byte</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">char</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">2 bytes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">short</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">int</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">4 bytes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">float</span></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">long</span></td>
					<td rowspan="2">8 bytes</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">double</span></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>
	<p>
		These memory usages are crucial to keep in mind when working with data.
		Failing to recall them can lead to unexpected results:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		byte num = 10;
		num += 256;
		System.out.println(num);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		10
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Why isn't the console displaying <span class="monoText">356</span>? Because
		the type <span class="monoText">byte</span> is restricted to exactly 1 byte
		&mdash; it can only store integers up to 256.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Arithmetic Operator Precedence.</span> Operators are
		evaluated in a specific order. Parentheses are always evaluated first.
		Inside the parentheses or otherwise, operators are evaluated left-to-right.
		Going from left to right, multiplication (<span class="monoText">*</span>)
		and modulus (<span class="monoText">%</span>) are evaluated before addition
		(<span class="monoText">+</span>) and subtraction (<span class="monoText"
			>-</span
		>).
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Modulus Operator.</span> Many computer science newcomers
		are unfamiliar with the modulus operator. This operator simply returns the
		remainder from dividing some number $a$ by ${b.}$ This is a particularly
		useful operation. With it, we can check several things. For example, if ${a
		\bmod 2}$ returns a remainder of 0, then we know that $a$ is an even number.
		If ${a \bmod 2}$ returns a remainder greater than 0, then we know that $a$
		is an odd number. The modulus is also helpful for obtaining the last $x$
		digits of a particular squence of numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Strongly-typed v. Weakly-typed Languages</span> In many
		languages, like Python and JavaScript, we, the programmers, are not required
		to explicitly state what types our data are. These are called
		<span class="italicsText">weakly-typed languages</span>. Java and C,
		however, are <span class="italicsText">strongly-typed</span> languages
		&mdash; we must explicitly provide a datum's type. The benefit of
		strongly-typed languages: It forces us to specify how much space we need to
		store data. This means we have no choice but to be efficient. Moreover, it
		helps us catch some of the most common programming errors.
