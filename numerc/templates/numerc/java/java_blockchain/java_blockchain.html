<h1>Blockchains & Cryptocurrency</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		This article presents an overview of blockchain technology and
		cryptocurrency. First proposed in 1982 by the American computer
		scientist and cryptographer David Chaum, blockchain is the underlying
		technology and data structure of cryptocurrency.

	<h2>The Issue of Trust</h2>
	<p>
		The ideal starting point for our journey towards understanding
		blockchains and cryptocurrency is the issue of trust. To demonstrate
		this issue, let's consider an example.
	</p>
	<p>
		Selena just moved to Los Angeles, California from New York City, New
		York. As anyone who's been to or lived in LA knows, Selena will need a
		car if she plans on living in the city long-term &mdash; it's not
		exactly NYC in terms of public transportation. Heeding common advice,
		Selena enters the car market, and as an avid outdoorswoman, she hopes
		to buy a Ford F-150.
	</p>
	<p>
		Across town, Alex is preparing to move to New York City. He knows he
		won't need a car, so he hopes to sell his Ford F-150 for a decent
		price. So posts his car, photos and all, on Craigslist.
	</p>
	<p>
		Selena sees Alex's ad on a Friday and contacts him. After introducing
		themselves, Alex agrees to drive the F-150 to Selena's house for her
		inspection. Looking at nearly every inch of the vehicle &mdash; inside,
		outside, trunk, under the hood, beneath the car &mdash; Selena says,
		<q
			>It looks great. Let's meet again next week Thursday to finalize
			things.</q
		>
		Ecstatic, Alex nods in approval.
	</p>
	<p>
		Question: What's there to finalize? If everything looks great, why not
		just hand over the cash then and there? Why wait the additional week?
		And why did Alex agree to it without objection? The answer is because
		neither of them <i>trust</i> each other.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Ford F-150 is the most stolen vehicle in the United States. Selena
		doesn't know if Alex actually owns the vehicle. Similarly, Alex doesn't
		know if Selena actually has enough money to pay for the car, whether
		she has a driver's license, or if she's a fugitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of this problem, Selena and Alex rely on a third party &mdash;
		the State. More specifically, the California state government. Both
		parties can transact freely and with trust because the State is always
		there to keep things in check &mdash; making sure that Selena isn't a
		fugitive or fraudster, or that Alex is a car jacker. These protections
		are put in place through laws, regulations, and various administrative
		rules: Alex must have a title certificate from the state DMV, Selena
		must sign and receive the most recent title, both parties must complete
		an odometer statement, and so on. The cost to all of this: There's
		paperwork to fill out, and that takes time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using the State as a solution to the trust issue is called a
		<i>centralized system approach</i>. In this case, the
		<b>centralized system</b> is the State. If we think carefully about the
		ways humans transfer property &mdash; whether that's a car, money,
		data, ideas, etc. &mdash; we realize that the predominant approach to
		ensuring trust is through a centralized system.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider modern financial transactions. How can the tribal
		art collector in Chicago trust that if they pay some seller in Honiara
		for a particular tapestry, they will, in fact, receive the tapestry?
		Likewise, how can the Solomon Islander seller trust that if they ship
		the tapestry, they will receive payment? Well, through the global
		banking system &mdash; a centralized system of banks that ensure the
		safety and trust necessary for international transactions.
	</p>
	<p>
		A centralized system is essentially a mutually trusted party. It has
		some database with information about the transacting parties. From that
		database, it provides <i>proof</i> or <i>evidence</i> that both
		parties' representations &mdash; what or who they claim to be &mdash;
		are true.
	</p>
	<p>
		So where does blockchain come in? It's the alternative to a centralized
		system &mdash; a <i>decentralized network approach</i>. The idea is to
		get rid of the centralized system by using a
		<b>decentralized network</b>. Returning to Alex and Selene, blockchain
		proposes:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<p>
			<i
				>Instead of having the State ensure trust, why don't we just use a
				decentralized network of car buyers and sellers? The sellers and
				buyers won't need a mutually trusted party, because the network
				itself guarantees trust.</i
			>
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		How the decentralized network achieves this feat will be our focus for
		the next few sections.
