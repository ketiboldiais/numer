	<h3>Multidimensional Data</h3>
	<p>Arrays can have have multiple dimensions:</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// single-dimensional array - size 4

		int[] samples = new int[4];

		// 2-dimensional array
		// first dimension: size 4
		// second dimension: size 8

		char[][] board = new char[4][8]

		// 3-dimensional array
		// first dimension: size 6
		// second dimension: size 8
		// third dimension: size 10

		double[][][] temperature = new double[6][8][10]
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As we can see, when we want multidimensional arrays, we indicate how many
		dimensions there are with square brackets. In all of these arrays, we have
		metadata. All multidimensional arrays are actually one giant array, with
		arrays as elements. Thus, the following 4-dimensional array:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int[][][][] deck = new int[12][12][12][12]
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		is one big array called <span class="monoText">deck</span>, containing four
		indices: index 0 contains an array of size 12, index 1 contains an array of
		size 12, index 2 contains an array of size 12, and index 3 contains an array
		of size 12. In each of the arrays, there too are indices. Perhaps index 0 of
		the array at index 0 is a clubs of value 2, and 12 an ace, etc. The
		takeaway: Every multidimensional array is just an array storing arrays.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int[][] arr = new int[4][8];

		int[] arrSlice = arr[0];

		System.out.println(arr.length);
		System.out.println(arrSlice.length);
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		4
		8
	</code></pre>
	<p>We can also initialize arrays in one line:</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		// initialize in one line:

		int[][] arr = {
			{ 1, 2 },
			{ 3, 4 }
		};

		// the above initialization is equivalent to:

		int arr = new int[2][2];
		arr[0][0] = 1;
		arr[0][1] = 2;
		arr[1][1] = 3;
		arr[1][2] = 4;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We can easily access values in a multidimensional array with square bracket
		notation:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		int[][] arr = {
			{ 1, 2 },
			{ 3, 4 }
		};

		t = arr[0][0]; // t = 1
		u = arr[0][1]; // u = 2
		v = arr[1][0]; // v = 3
		w = arr[1][1]; // w = 4
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Do not, under any circumstances, think of multidimensional arrays as akin to
		rows and columns. This warning is particularly pertinent to those coming
		from finance or accounting backgrounds; likely due to years of working with
		spreadsheets or tables. A better way to think of arrays: A horizontal line
		of boxes numbered from left to right starting at 0, and each box contains a
		horizontal line of boxes numbered from left to right starting at 0:

		<span class="topic">Multi-level Loops.</span> When using multidimensional
		arrays, we frequently must loop through multiple levels:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-java"><code>
		for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < array[i].length; j++) {
				System.out.println(array[i][j]);
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why Use Multidimensional Arrays?</span> Numerous pieces
		of data are conceptually multidimensional arrays. Images, for example, can
		be thought of as multidimensional arrays. There are numerous pixels, with
		every pixel containing colors. Those pixels in turn have a position, which,
		when placed in a particular order (i.e., an array), an image is produced.
	</p>
	<p>
		Chronological weather data (e.g., climate change models) is particularly
		dependent on the concept of multidimensional arrays. Each day contains
		hours, and at each hour, there might be temperatures.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recorded sound relies on the concept of multidimensional arrays. There are
		units of time, and in each unit of time, there are pressure measurements.
		Those units of time themselves are stored in an array of size two: the left
		ear and the right ear.
