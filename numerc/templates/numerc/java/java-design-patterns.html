<h1>Design Patterns</h1>

		<span class="drop">W</span>hen Sisyphus cheated death, Hades compelled him
		to roll a boulder up a steep hill. At some point near the crest, the stone
		would return to the foot, consigning Sisyphus to eternal repetition. As
		draconian as Sisyphus's punishment may be, his toil illustrates the
		principle of <span class="term">pattern</span> &mdash; if we see the king of
		Ephyra maneuvering a boulder up a hill long enough, we can identify exactly
		when the boulder begins rolling back down.
	</p>
	<p>
		This phenomenon exists in programming. Many programming problems have common
		forms, both in statement and solution. Because of these commonalities, there
		are <b>design patterns</b> &mdash; recurring sets of rules for implementing
		programming solutions.
	</p>
	<p>Design patterns are organized into three <i>families</i>:</p>
	<figure>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Creational patterns</b> concern the process of creating objects.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Structural patterns</b> deal with the composition of classes or
				objects.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Behavioral patterns</b> characterize how classes or objects interact
				and distribute responsibility.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Within each of the families above, there are two sub-families of patterns:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Class patterns</b> concern relations between classes and their
				subclasses &mdash; e.g., inheritance.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Object patterns</b> deal with object relationships, which are more
				dynamic, given that they can be changed at runtime. Object patterns
				describe how objects can be composed into larger structures using object
				composition or by including objects within other objects.
			</li>
		</ul>
