	<h3>Errors</h3>
	<p>
		Errors in <span class="monoText">ML</span> fall into three groups: (1)
		<span class="italicsText">syntax errors</span>, (2)
		<span class="italicsText">type errors</span>, and (3)
		<span class="italicsText">runtime errors</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="term">Syntax errors</span> are errors caused by writing
		something incorrectly. Incorrect meaning we have written something in
		violation of <span class="monoText">ML</span>'s syntax.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="term">Type errors</span> are errors caused by failing to pass a
		type check. These errors occur when we fail to follow the type checking
		rules; e.g., adding an <span class="monoText">int</span> type variable to a
		<span class="monoText">bool</span> type variable.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="term">Runtime errors</span> are errors that occur during
		evaluation. This might be because we used an operator incorrectly, or
		because we wrote a recursive function that
		<span class="italicsText">bottoms out</span> &mdash; making too many
		recursive calls such that the program terminates.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Logic errors.</span> Errors that are not caught by
		<span class="monoText">ML</span> can be broadly classified as
		<span class="term">logic errors</span>. Here, we complied with syntax and
		semantics, so we do not see any syntax, type, or runtime errors, but our
		program does something outside of our expections. Perhaps it hangs (enters
		an infinite loop), returns an unexpected value, or returns an expected value
		but not in the way we intended.
	</p>
	<p>
		The errors above all occur in sequence. In other words, in order of
		occurrence, we will see syntax errors, then type errors, then runtime errors
		last. This means that if we see a runtime error, then we did not have a
		syntax or type error, but if we see a syntax error, we do not know if there
		is a type or runtime error, at least not yet.
	</p>
