<h1>A Brief History of Programming Languages</h1>
<section id="forray">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">I</span>n the beginning, programs were sequences of
		movements, carried out by mechanical devices. One of the earliest examples
		was the <span class="italicsText">difference engine</span>, a mechanical
		calculator invented by the English engineer Charles Babbage in the 1820s.
		The difference engine was designed to tabulate polynomial functions, a
		critically important task for engineering, scientific analysis, and
		navigation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several years later, in 1837, Babbage proposed a more general-purpose
		computer, the <span class="italicsText">Analytical Engine</span>, as a
		successor to his earlier work. Compared to the difference engine, the
		Analytical Engine was much more sophisticated &mdash; it had an arithmetic
		logic unit, conditional branching and loops, as well as integrated memory.
		Babbage never saw his idea to fruition, but if he did, it would've looked
		and operated uncannily similar to modern computers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Babbage's ideas were partly inspired by the
		<span class="italicsText">Jacquard Loom</span>, a loom invented by the
		French weaver Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804. Jacquard created the loom as
		way to simplify the manufacture of textiles with complex patterns. This was
		accomplished by feeding the loom a chain of
		<span class="italicsText">punchcards</span>. The punchcards contained the
		instructions for the patterns, and when fed to the machine, the card would
		either push, or not push (given a hole), small levers. Arranging the holes
		on the punchcard, we can imagine how the resulting arrangement of moved and
		unmoved levers can lead to quick pattern construction. This use of
		punchcards not only inspired Babbage, but computers over a century later.
	</p>
	<p>
		Following Babbage's working, a variety of punched-card-handling machines
		appeared. Many of these early computers required manually plugging and
		unplugging various wires and components for computations.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was after the Second World War that we began seeing the proliferation of
		much more sophisticated computers. The
		<span class="italicsText">ENIAC</span> (Electronic Numerical Integrator and
		Computer) was the first programmable digital computer. Financed by the
		United States Army, the computer was intended to analyze ballistics results
		for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. It consisted of
		over 17,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 30 tons, and consumed 140 kW for its
		operations.
	</p>
	<p>
		As mathematics and computer science progressed, researchers and academics
		began looking at programs differently &mdash; programs are data. This shift
		led to the idea of of encoding programs as numbers, and storing those
		numbers as data. I.e., machine language.
