	<h3>Basic Constructs</h3>
	<p>
		Prolog is a logic programming language. More broadly, it is a member of the
		declarative programming language family. In Prolog, programs are a set of
		axioms defining relations between objects. The computation resulting from
		runnning a Prolog program is a <span class="term">deduction</span>. More
		specifically, the result is a response to query, formulated from rules (the
		axioms) applied to facts.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are three basic constructs in Prolog: <span class="term">facts</span>,
		<span class="term">rules</span>, and <span class="term">queries</span>.
		Let's look at each construct in turn.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="facts" class="grid-item">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Facts.</span> A fact states a
		<span class="italicsText">relation</span> between objects. Below are some
		facts in Prolog:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		late(john).
		likes(harry, sally).
		factor(4, 12).
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The use of lower-case is no accident. Both predicates and names must be in
		lower-case. Translating the expressions above into natural language:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>late(john) ${\implies}$ &#8220;John is late&#8221;</li>
			<li>likes(harry, sally) ${\implies}$ &#8220;Harry likes Sally.&#8221;</li>
			<li>factor(4,12) ${\implies}$ &#8220;4 is a factor of 12.&#8221;</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Notice in each of the facts above, there are relations between objects.
		These relations are also called <span class="term">predicates</span>. The
		<span class="italicsText">names</span> of the objects are called
		<span class="term">atoms</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <span class="monoText">Prolog</span>, a fact represents what is
		<span class="underlineText">known</span>. We can think of them as
		<span class="italicsText">axioms</span>. We can think of a set of facts as a
		description of a situation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Consider the fact &#8220;The dog is black.&#8221; In Prolog, we express this
		fact as:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		black(dog).
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the expression, the atoms contained in the parentheses are the fact's
		<span class="term">arguments</span>. In this case, the atom
		<span class="monoText">dog</span> is the argument to the expression. We can
		of course, have multiple parameters (i.e., multiple arguments):
	</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		drank(romeo, poison)
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In this expression, there are two arguments &mdash;
		<span class="monoText">romeo</span> and
		<span class="monoText">poison</span>. The number of parameters is called the
		expression's <span class="term">arity</span>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="rules" class="grid-item">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Rules.</span> In Prolog, a
		<span class="term">rule</span> is a construct that allows us to infer facts
		from existing facts. Suppose the following facts: Paris likes Helen, Helen
		likes Paris, and Menelausk likes Helen. Expressing these facts in Prolog:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		likes(paris, helen).
		likes(helen, paris).
		likes(menelaus, helen).
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Now let's say that a person ${a}$ is in love with a person ${b}$ if, and
		only if, ${a}$ likes ${b}$ and ${b}$ likes ${a.}$ To express this rule in
		Prolog:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		loves(A,B):-
			likes(A,B),
			likes(B,A).
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The rule above reads, "${A}$ loves ${B}$ if, and only if, ${A}$ likes ${B}$
		<span class="italicsText">and</span> ${B}$ likes ${A.}$" Observe the use of
		uppercase letters. In Prolog, <span class="term">variables</span> are
		<span class="underlineText">always</span> indicated by uppercase letters.
		Next, observe the comma. The comma acts like an
		<span class="italicsText">and</span>. Prolog, as a logic programming
		language, obviously supports Boolean connectives. Unlike other languages,
		however, connectives use symbols that are more exclusively reserved for
		other syntax:
	</p>

	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>Connective</th>
				<th>Syntax</th>
				<th>Comment</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>IFF</td>
					<td>:-</td>
					<td>colon then hyphen</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>AND</td>
					<td>,</td>
					<td>a comma</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>OR</td>
					<td>;</td>
					<td>semicolon</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>NOT</td>
					<td>not</td>
					<td>all lowercase</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For those coming from more formal logic backgrounds, wwe can define rules
		for logical connectives:
	</p>

	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>Connective</th>
				<th>Rule</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>AND</td>
					<td>and(A,B) :- A,B.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>OR</td>
					<td>or(A,B) :- A;B.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>NAND</td>
					<td>nand(A,B) :- not(and(A,B)).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>NOR</td>
					<td>nor(A,B) :- not(or(A,B)).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>XOR</td>
					<td>xor(A,B) :- or(A,B), nand(A,B).</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>

	<p>
		We will use and revisit these definitions in later sections. The beauty of
		Prolog is how elegantly it implements these constructs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Returning to our loves rule, evaluates as such: If
		<span class="monoText">likes(x,y)</span> evaluates to
		<span class="monoText">true</span>, <span class="underlineText">and</span>
		<span class="monoText">likes(y,x)</span> evaluates to
		<span class="monoText">true</span>, then the expression evaluates to
		<span class="monoText">true</span>. Otherwise, it evaluates to
		<span class="monoText">false</span>. The general syntax of a rule:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>
				${r}$(${obj_0, \ldots, obj_n}$) :- ${r}$(${obj_0, \ldots, obj_i}$)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul class="def">
			<li class="where">${r}$ is some relationship,</li>
			<li>
				${obj_0, \ldots, obj_n}$ and ${obj_0, \ldots, obj_i}$ are objects, and
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="monoText">:-</span> denotes
				<span class="term">iff</span> (if and only if)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The head of a rule is fact that results from the body of the rule being
		true. In actuality, facts are actually rules whose body is true:
		<span class="monoText">head :- true.</span>
	</p>

	<p>Consider the following rules and facts employing variables:</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		weather(phoenix, summer, hot).
		weather(la, summer, warm).

		warmer_than(C1, C2) :-
			weather(C1, summer, hot),
			weather(C2, summer, warm),
			write(C1), write(' is warmer '), write(C2), nl.
	</code></pre>

	<p>Let's ask this question:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		?- warmer_than(phoenix, la).
		phoenix is warmer than la
		true.
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="queries" class="grid-item">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Queries.</span> With the rules and facts stated, we can
		pass <span class="term">queries</span> &mdash; true or false questions we
		would like answered given the existing facts and rules. In the preceding
		section's example <span class="term">loves</span> rule, we wrote our code in
		a filed called <span class="monoText">foo.pl</span>. From our terminal:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		swipl foo.pl
		
		?- loves(helen, paris).
		true

		?- loves(paris, helen).
		true

		?- loves(helen, menelaus).
		false
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="variables" class="grid-item">
	<p><span class="topic">Variables.</span> Consider the following facts:</p>

	<pre class="language-prolog"><code>
		weather(phoenix, summer, hot).
		weather(la, summer, warm).
		weather(phoenix, winter, warm).
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can ask a question give these facts:</p>

	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		swipl foo.pl

		?- weather(City, summer, hot).
		City = phoenix
	</code></pre>

	<p>Now let's say we want to find all the cities that are warm:</p>

	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		?- weather(City,_,warm).
		City = la;
		City = phoenix
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice that when we asked this question, Prolog paused for a moment before
		displaying the next result. Prolog does this as a matter of efficiency
		&mdash; "Before I start checking for other possible matches, let me first
		see if the user is satisfied with this answer." To see the next possible
		answer, we enter a semicolon (<span class="monoText">;</span>).
	</p>

	<p>We can ask present more complex queries:</p>

	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		?- weather(City, summer, hot), weather(City, winter, warm).

		City = phoenix;
		False
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we entered a semicolon following the answer, Prolog returns
		<span class="monoText">False</span>, because there are no other possible
		answers. These examples show how we ask
		<span class="term">compound queries</span> in Prolog.
