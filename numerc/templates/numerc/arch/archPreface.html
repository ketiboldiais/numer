<h2>Computer Architecture</h2>

<p>Most foundational computer science courses will not delve too deeply into computer architecture. However, it is arguably a good idea to at the very least introduce some key concepts in computer architecture early on. While there is some potential for confusion and overcomplicating what should be preliminary matters, brief overviews can prevent burning and lingering questions down the line (many of which go unaddressed until the helpless programmer encounters a bug too close to hardware for comfort). For these reasons, we explore some of the ways computers work in the materials that follow.</p>

<h3>The Outline of a Computer</h3>
<p>A computer can be thought of as consisting of three core components: the ROM ("Read-only Memory"), CPU ("Central Processing Unit"), and RAM ("Random Access Memory"). With these components, we can connect <span class="italicsText">exteral devices</span>&mdash;a keyboard, a mouse, a monitor, speakers, etc. These devices allow us to input data, as well as perceive output from the computer in return. With the ability to input data, we can write programs to be compiled by the computer.
</p>
<p>In the materials that follow, we will start at the lowest level, the core components. From there, we gradually work our way up, passing through higher levels of abstraction one at a time, until we reach the very highest&mdash;programs written in programming languages.</p>
