<h1>C the Low Level</h1>
<section>
	<p>Nodding to tradition, here is our introductory C program:</p>
	<pre class="language-c"><code>
		#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
		int main() {
			printf("Hello, world\n");
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The program we've written above is called a
		<span class="term">source program</span>, and it's stored in a
		<span class="term">source file</span> (in the example above, the source
		program is stored in a file named <span class="monoText">Hello.c</span>).
		The entire program is a collection of bytes, which are chunks of 8 bits.
		Every bit has a <span class="term">state</span>, which can be only one of
		two values: 0 or 1. Accordingly, every program, across all languages, is a
		sequence of 0s and 1s.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every character in the source program above is represented by unique
		integer, as proscribed by the ASCII standard (or, in most modern standards,
		UNICODE). For example, the character <span class="monoText">#</span> is
		represented by the integer 35, <span class="monoText">i</span> by 105,
		<span class="monoText">\n</span> by 10, and whitespace (denoted
		<span class="monoText">SP</span>) by 32.
	</p>
	<p>
		Files like <span class="monoText">Hello.c</span> are called
		<span class="italicsText">text files</span> &mdash; files that consist
		exclusively of ASCII characters. All other files are called
		<span class="italicsText">binary files</span>. For reasons we will see
		later, this is a helpful distinction to keep in mind.
	</p>
