<h1>Computer Networks</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>In this article, we examine basic principles in computer networks.</p>
	<p>
		One answer: There's a distinction between <i>communications</i> and
		<i>networks</i>. We can think of <i>communications</i> as the plumbing
		of all the connections between computers. <i>Networks</i> are what
		actually go through the plumbing. Alternatively, under this answer, we
		can think of communications as akin to the actual, physical roads in a
		road system. In that sense, communications experts are like civil
		engineers; they answer questions like: What materials should the roads
		be made of? Under what temperatures do the materials expand and
		contract? How much weight can the materials support? In computer
		networking, the civil engineer in this example is the electrical
		engineer's analog. Examining the questions, we can surmise that the
		electrical engineer's questions pertain primarily to hardware.
	</p>
	<p>
		The network experts, in contrast, are like urban planners. They answer
		such questions as: Should this particular road be a one- or two-way?
		How many lanes should this particular road have? What should the speed
		limit for this road be? Where should I place this traffic light? How
		long should the red traffic light remain on? Here, the urban planner is
		an analog of the network engineer, whose questions are primarily
		related to software.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another answer: A communication is the transfer of information from a
		system ${\texttt{A}}$ to a system ${\texttt{C}.}$ If the transfer must
		be given to some intermediate system &mdash; e.g., system
		${\texttt{B}}$ &mdash; in order to reach system ${\texttt{C},}$ then we
		have a <i>network</i>. Otherwise, it's just a communication.
