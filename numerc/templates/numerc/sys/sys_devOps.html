<h1>Computer Networks</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>In this article, we examine basic principles in computer networks.</p>
	<p>
		One answer: There's a distinction between <i>communications</i> and
		<i>networks</i>. We can think of <i>communications</i> as the plumbing
		of all the connections between computers. <i>Networks</i> are what
		actually go through the plumbing. Alternatively, under this answer, we
		can think of communications as akin to the actual, physical roads in a
		road system. In that sense, communications experts are like civil
		engineers; they answer questions like: What materials should the roads
		be made of? Under what temperatures do the materials expand and
		contract? How much weight can the materials support? In computer
		networking, the civil engineer in this example is the electrical
		engineer's analog. Examining the questions, we can surmise that the
		electrical engineer's questions pertain primarily to hardware.
	</p>
	<p>
		The network experts, in contrast, are like urban planners. They answer
		such questions as: Should this particular road be a one- or two-way?
		How many lanes should this particular road have? What should the speed
		limit for this road be? Where should I place this traffic light? How
		long should the red traffic light remain on? Here, the urban planner is
		an analog of the network engineer, whose questions are primarily
		related to software.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another answer: A communication is the transfer of information from a
		system ${\texttt{A}}$ to a system ${\texttt{C}.}$ If the transfer must
		be given to some intermediate system &mdash; e.g., system
		${\texttt{B}}$ &mdash; in order to reach system ${\texttt{C},}$ then we
		have a <i>network</i>. Otherwise, it's just a communication.

		<h2>A Brief History</h2>
		<p>
			Below is a brief timeline of some of the major events in computer
			networking.
		</p>
		<div id="networks_history"></div>
		<p>
			Arguably, the key event that started everything off was the 1961
			publication of Leonard Kleinrock's paper on packet switching. Before
			Kleinrock's ideas, networks were circuit switched. If Susan called
			Boram, Susan's call would be routed to a switchboard operator, who
			would respond by asking
			<q>Good evening madame, whom shall I connect you to?</q> To which
			Susan would respond,
			<q>Good evening. Please connect me to Boram Seymour.</q> The operator
			would then take a jack and plug it into a particular port, creating a
			physical, wired connection between Susan and Boram. Once connected,
			Susan and Boram can speak to one another, just as we would today.
			When Boram says, <q>Oh by the way,</q> the sound waves generated by
			her voice box travel down the wired connection, reaching Susan's
			receiver.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kleinrock looked at all of these processes and came up with a
			different approach: Instead of having some operator manually plugging
			in these cables, why don't we do this. Take the signal, chop it up
			into tiny, discrete pieces (a process called <i>sampling</i>), assign
			those pieces numbers. For example, for the word <var>hi</var>,
			<var>h</var> might map to ${104,}$ <var>i</var> to ${105.}$ Then,
			we'll represent ${104}$ with this particular voltage, and ${105}$
			with this other voltage. A bundle of those voltages is called a
			<b>packet</b>, and that's what will travel along the connections.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="the_internet">
		<h2>The Internet</h2>
		<p>
			An internetwork is a set of millions of endpoints &mdash; you, me,
			Susan, Boram, Susan's Apple watch and Boram's refrigerator &mdash;
			connected over a network. Some of these endpoints are addressed by
			numbers, others behind a <i>virtual endpoint.</i> Because an
			internetwork is itself a node, we can connect one internetwork to
			another with a network. The network of all these internetworks is
			<b>the Internet</b>.
		</p>
		<figure class="block">
			<div id="network_components_1"></div>
			<figcaption>A small internetwork</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Say we entered the TARDIS and jump back to the 1950s, emerging into
			the sight of a tall, brooding figure &mdash; Eisenhower.
			Unsurprisingly astute, Eisenhower capitalizes on the situation:
			<q
				>Give me a complete architecture of the Internet by Monday,
				0900.</q
			>
			Tall order. Where should we start?
		</p>
		<p>
			A good starting point is to be clear about what the most important
			objectives are. For the Internet, some of the most critical
			objectives include:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<i>Reliability.</i> We want to ensure that when packets are sent
				from point ${A}$ under the instruction to go to point ${B,}$ we
				want to ensure that they will in fact arrive at point ${B.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Speed.</i> We want the packets to get to go from ${A}$ to ${B}$
				as fast as possible, without sacrificing the other objectives.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Security.</i> If a packet is sent from ${A}$ to only ${B,}$ the
				packet should arrive at ${B}$ and only ${B.}$
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In the modern era, the attempt to satisfy these objectives resulted
			in a somewhat hierarchical structure. At the Internet's core are
			<b>ISPs (Internet Service Providers)</b> &mdash; entities that
			provide users access to larger networks. An easy way to think about
			what exactly ISPs are is to consider the following scenario.
		</p>
		<p>
			Susan and Boram move in to a new house. The two have their own
			computers, with lots of movies, music, and books. They don't have
			Internet yet, so they start by establishing a network between their
			computers, allowing one another to browse the other's media folders:
		</p>
		<div id="net1"></div>
		<p>
			After a few weeks, two more people &mdash; Jane and Sadik &mdash;
			build a house near Susan and Boram's. Jane and Sadik also decide to
			share the movies, music, and books they have, so they enlist Susan to
			make the network connections:
		</p>
		<div id="net2"></div>
		<p>
			Eventually, many more people join the neighborhood, all willing to
			share their data. Susan works tirelessly away:
		</p>
		<div id="net3"></div>
		<p>
			Despite this increasingly complicated web of networks, the
			neighborhood only holds a tiny, tiny fraction of all the possible
			media they can get their hands on. After a few months, a company
			called Conekt &mdash; from a large town nearby &mdash; calls Susan:
			<q
				>Hey, we've seen all this work you've done for the neighborhood.
				Would you want to connect to our network?
			</q>
			Susan is ecstatic, calls a neighborhood meeting, and puts the
			proposal to a vote. Unanimous approval within minutes. So Conekt
			comes to Susan's neighborhood &mdash; called
			<var>n1</var> (<i>neighborhood 1</i>) &mdash; and begins making the
			connections:
		</p>
		<div id="net4"></div>
		<p>
			Why did the neighborhood jump on board so quickly? Because it turns
			out that Conekt is an <i>ISP</i> &mdash; their network connects to
			numerous other networks. And even more importantly, Conekt itself is
			connected to even larger ISPs:
		</p>
		<div id="net5"></div>
		<p>
			ISPs are organized by hierarchy. <b>Tier-1 ISPs</b> are the largest
			ISPs with national and international coverage. These ISPs include
			companies like AT&T, Sprint, CenturyLink, Deutsche Telekom, NTT
			Communications, and a few others. Tier-1 ISPs are the entities that
			go out and hire companies to lay down the cables connecting networks
			across the United States to Asia, Europe, South America, and Africa.
			Who pays these Tier-1 ISPs? National governments and
			<i>tier-2 ISPs</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Tier-2 ISPs</b> are also entities that provide access to networks,
			ultimately connecting to a Tier-1 ISP. Tier-2 ISPs are smaller and
			more often regional network providers. Think Comcast, Virgin Media,
			Cox Communications, CTS Telecom, and so on. These entities provide
			internet access for regions &mdash; southwest Michigan, central
			California, upstate New York, and so on. When these entities are
			paid, part of the money goes to Comcast as profit, and another part
			of it goes to a Tier-1 ISP (for Comcast, Tata Communications, India's
			Tier-1 ISP). Who pays the Tier-2 ISPs? , state governments, large
			enterprises, and <i>Tier-3 ISPs</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Tier-3 ISPs are the ISPs we, as people, interact with directly.
			They're <i>access providers</i> and include entities like Time Warner
			Cable, Earthlink, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Xfinity, Frontier,
			Suddenlink, and many, many others. Who pays the Tier-3 ISPs? Well,
			us, and <i>local ISPs</i>. <b>Local ISPs</b> are network providers
			for smaller areas. They aren't as large as Tier-3 ISPs, but bigger
			than the average user. For example, iTV provides access for small
			pockets of neighborhoods throughout Illinois. Local ISPs also include
			the network access providers like major universities and hospitals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Putting all of this together, we can see why the Internet hasn't
			descended into chaos. There's a rough hierarchy, maintained by supply
			and demand. We pay the local ISP to transport our email from Madison,
			Wisconsin, to Tokyo, Japan. The local ISP pays the tier-3 ISP to
			transport the email, perhaps to Chicago. The tier-3 ISP pays the
			tier-2 ISP to transport the email to somewhere in California. The
			tier-2 ISP pays the tier-1 ISP to send the email to a tier-1 ISP in
			Asia. The tier-2 ISP in Tokyo pays the Asian tier-1 ISP to receive
			that email, followed by a tier-3 ISP, a tier-2 ISP, and finally a
			local Japanese ISP.
		</p>

	<section id="layers">
		<h3>Network Layers</h3>
		<p>
			While the Internet has a rough hierarchy, it's more
			Pollock-meets-Picasso than M.C. Escher. There are outlines here and
			there, but much of it is a smorgasbord of dizzying components: hosts,
			routers, applications, antennas, satellites, cables, hardware,
			software, and so on. All of these components have unique, dedicated
			tasks, so how do we ensure that one component doesn't go off ruining
			things for everyone else?
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to solve this problem is to shift the way we think about the
			Internet. Instead of thinking of the Internet as some physical
			connection &mdash; as we did in the previous section &mdash; we want
			to think of it as a <b>service</b>. For example, we could think of
			air travel in terms of its physical components. There are airplanes,
			airports, security gates, travelers, flight attendants, pilots,
			airport restaurants, etc. And just like the Internet, we have
			regional airlines, national airlines, and international airlines. How
			does air travel not collapse because of all these different
			components and self-interests? Through <b>layers of services</b> and
			<b>protocols</b> (i.e., laws). We'll discuss the protocol aspect
			later, but for now, let's focus on the layers of services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose our friend Allen buys a ticket from Jacksonville, North
			Carolina, to LA, California. This is a fairly long flightpath. Allen
			goes to Albert J. Ellis Airport (OAJ) &mdash; a small regional
			airport &mdash; and boards a Southwest Airlines flight to LAX, a
			large international airport. To get to LA, Allen has his baggage
			checked in at OAJ, then gets to the gates, and eventually takes off.
			In essence, there are a layer of services, or points, from top to
			bottom:
		</p>
		<div id="airline_service"></div>
		<p>
			When Allen gets to LAX, he goes through the same layers of services
			and points, from bottom to top:
		</p>
		<div id="airline_service2"></div>
		<p>
			We see the same idea at work with the Internet. Suppose we're waiting
			at O'Hare airport and we visit <var>CNN.com</var>. Entering the URL,
			we go through several layers. First, the <b>application layer</b>,
			our browser. By entering the URL into our address bar and hitting
			enter, we're telling the browser to communicate with the CNN
			application, stored on some server in, say, Atlanta. For this
			communication to occur, the application layer then creates a packet,
			attaches a message to it, and sends it to the <b>transport layer</b>,
			which also exists on our laptop:
		</p>
		<div id="packet1"></div>
		<aside>
			<div id="internet_service_layers"></div>
		</aside>
		<p>
			The transport layer receives this packet, and recognizes that it must
			deliver this packet to the <i>transport layer</i> of the server in
			Atlanta. This is akin to how a baggage tag from the Jacksonville
			airport's baggage check-in area is only understood by the baggage
			handlers at the LAX baggage claim area. To ensure the CNN server's
			transportation layer understands what to do when it receives the
			transport layer's communication, the transport layer provides what we
			can think of as a barcode &mdash; some kind of information that
			allows the CNN server's transport layer to determine which
			application layer the message it receives belongs to. This
			information also ensures that the packet doesn't get lost, and in the
			event it does, not in the wrong hands. So, it adds this additional
			information &mdash; called a <b>segment</b> &mdash; to the packet:
		</p>
		<div id="packet2"></div>
		<p>
			The transport layer then sends this packet to the
			<b>network layer</b>. The network layer's job is to determine the
			fastest possible route to Atlanta. Should it go to St. Louis then
			Atlanta? Indianapolis? Washington D.C.? The transport layer is only
			focused on efficiency; it doesn't worry about security, or whether
			there's anything wrong with the message. It just focuses on
			efficiency. Once the transport layer figures out the best possible
			routes to take, it adds its determinations &mdash; called a
			<b>datagram</b> &mdash; to the packet:
		</p>
		<div id="packet3"></div>
		<p>
			The transport layer then sends the packet to the <b>link layer</b>.
			The link layer's job is to define the start (through information
			called the <i>frame header</i>) and end of the packet (the
			<i>frame footer</i>), as well as information that allows the next
			device's physical layer to interpret the packet:
		</p>
		<div id="packet4"></div>
		<p>
			Once the link layer is done, it sends the packet to the
			<b>physical layer</b> &mdash; perhaps a physical cable (e.g.,
			Ethernet or a phone line) or, in the modern era, a radio signal
			(WiFi). Let's say it's a WiFi signal. The physical layer &mdash; a
			WiFi card &mdash; receives the packet, looks at the link information,
			and tells our laptop's WiFi antenna to vibrate at particular
			frequencies (essentially, the physical form of the packet).
		</p>
		<p>
			This radio waves (the packet) is received by a <b>switch</b>, a
			device that routes packets elsewhere (in our case, a WiFi router).
			The WiFi router's physical layer &mdash; another radio antenna
			&mdash; receives these radio waves, and using the frame information,
			samples the signal into bits. These bits are then sent to the WiFi
			router's <i>link layer</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The WiFi router's link layer then looks at the datagram, and only the
			datagram (remember, each layer only understands its corresponding
			layer from the sending device). Part of the datagram contains our
			device's <b>MAC (Media Access Control) address</b>, which we can
			think of as our device's unique ID. Seeing our MAC address, the WiFi
			router is programmed to forward the packet elsewhere. To ensure the
			packet is sent to the next router, the WiFi router removes the
			previous frames, and adds new ones:
		</p>
		<div id="packet5"></div>
		<p>
			This is because the previous frames only included information
			providing that the packet gets to the WiFi router. It's the same idea
			behind the physical baggage tag numbers for multiple flights. If a
			bag is supposed to go from JFK to ORD to LAX, the baggage handlers at
			JFK must include information providing that the bag's headed to ORD.
			When it gets to ORD, the baggage handlers there have to remove the
			information <q>To ORD</q>, replacing it instead, with, <q>To LAX.</q
			><sup></sup>
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Importantly, the WiFi router only has a physical layer and a link
				layer. It does not have a network layer. As such, it cannot touch
				the network, transport, and application layers' provided
				information.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			The WiFi router then sends this to a <b>router</b>, a larger device
			that directs network traffic. That router might be located in St.
			Louis. The packet goes to the router's physical layer, which samples
			the packet into bits, and sends those bits to the link layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The link layer looks at these bits, and sees that it came from our
			WiFi router. Recognizing this fact, the link layer removes the
			frames, and passes it to the router's network layer. The network
			layer looks at the datagram, and sees that's it's supposed to go to
			Atlanta. So, it removes the old datagram and adds a new one: The new
			datagram provides that the packet should go to Atlanta, but the next
			hub should be Washington D.C.
		</p>
		<p>
			The network layer then hands the modified packet to the link layer.
			The link layer then adds new frames, this time including the
			Washington D.C. router's hardware address:
		</p>
		<div id="packet6"></div>
		<p>
			This process continues, going from router to router, until it finally
			reaches the server in Atlanta. Once there, it passes through layers,
			just as we've discussed at length. The packet gets to the server's
			physical layer, which samples the signal into bits. The bits are sent
			to the link layer, which then sees that the packet is supposed to go
			to the hardware address of the CNN server in Atlanta.
			<q>That's me!</q> Knowing this fact, the link layer removes the
			frames, and sends the packet up to the network layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The network layer looks at the datagram, and sees that the packet is
			supposed to go to the CNN server in Atlanta. <q>That's me!</q> The
			network layer removes the datagram, and sends it up to the transport
			layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The transport layer looks at the segment, which looks at the packet's
			number. Suppose that number is <var>195</var>. The transport layer
			asks, <q>What was previous packet's number?</q> It determines that it
			was <var>194</var> and concludes that the packet was received in
			order. So, the transport layer sends the packet up to the application
			layer.
		</p>
		<p>
			The application layer &mdash; some backend framework, perhaps Node.js
			&mdash; looks at the <i>message</i>, and sees that it's a
			<var>GET</var> request for <var>CNN.com</var>. So, the application
			layer creates a new packet, and in that packet's message, it places
			<var>CNN.com</var>'s <var>index.html</var> file, and sends that
			packet on its way. The process continues.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="protocols">
		<h3>Protocols</h3>
		<p>
			The Internet is also held together by <b>protocols</b> &mdash; rules
			defining the format of messages, the order they're sent and received
			among network entities, and the actions those entities must take upon
			message transmission and receipt.
		</p>
		<p>
			Protocols ensure that we don't have situations where messages crash
			into one another, entities talking to each other at the same time, or
			waiting too long to respond or speak.
		</p>
		<p>
			Designing these protocols is tricky. We have to balance both fairness
			and efficiency. To illustrate, consider the problem of a Zoom
			meeting. Undoubtedly, we've all witnessed the situation where
			attendees speak over one another. How might we avoid this problem?
			Well, we could write a protocol instructing attendees to be cautious:
			Have something to say? Wait for ${5}$ seconds and if no one else has
			spoken, speak.
		</p>
		<p>
			But does this actually solve the problem? Not really. Some of us have
			also seen situations where the Zoom speaker asks,
			<q>Any questions?</q> ${5}$ seconds pass and suddenly there are two
			attendees asking questions at the same time. A few
			<q>No please go ahead</q> are exchanged. ${2}$ seconds pass and again
			the two attendees speak over one another. Of course, the probability
			of a collision is lowered with the protocol, but the problem
			nevertheless remains.
		</p>
		<p>
			How about this:
			<q
				>Attendees each have a designated ${5}$ minutes to interrupt and
				ask questions. Outside of those ${5}$ minutes, the attendee may not
				speak.</q
			>
			This is called a <b>fixed scheduling</b> approach, and it certainly
			avoids collisions. But what's the problem? Efficiency. Given five
			attendees, we could have a situation where the first four attendees
			have nothing to ask but the fifth attendee has plenty to ask. In
			which case the fifth attendee must not only wait for ${20}$ minutes,
			but could have used some of the unused ${20}$ minutes. This is both
			inefficient and unfair.
		</p>
		<p>
			The same kind of problem exists in networks. When we examine
			protocols in closer detail later, we'll find that we want to maximize
			the amount of time, but also need to be fair.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="terminology">
		<h3>Terminology</h3>
		<p>
			Still continuing in our broad overview, let's define a few pieces of
			terminology to help us better understand ideas in later sections.
		</p>

		<section id="edges">
			<h4>Network Edges</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Network edges</b> are <i>internet leaves</i>. These are the
				<i>applications</i> (e.g., browsers, the Facebook app, Instagram,
				mail clients) and <i>hosts</i> (also called <i>end systems</i>)
				(web servers, file storage systems, etc).
			</p>
			<p>
				Network edges are structured in one of two approaches: the
				<b>client-server model</b> or the <b>peer-to-peer model</b>. In the
				client-server model, the client host (e.g., a web browser) sends
				requests to a server that's always on and listening to requests,
				and the server responds.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the peer-to-peer model, there is no dedicated server, but every
				machine &mdash; laptop, desktop, phone, smart watch, smart
				refrigerator, smart ${x}$ &mdash; behaves as both a client and a
				server. This is the architecture behind Skype, Blockchain,
				BitTorrent, and many others. If ${x}$ and ${y}$ are devices &mdash;
				called
				<i>peers</i> &mdash; in a peer-to-peer network, as long as both
				${x}$ and ${y}$ are on and protocols are satisfied, ${x}$ and ${y}$
				can connect and exchange data.<sup></sup>
			</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					This is where the <i>seeding</i> comes from in torrent services.
					When we torrent a file, we are downloading data from some other
					peer on the network. But, for us to download that data, the
					device containing that data must be <q>turned on</q> in the
					network. The device is turned on when its owner allows the
					torrent client to <i>seed</i> the file. In the torrenting
					community, network peers that torrent files but do not seed are
					called <i>leechers</i>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<section id="tcp">
				<h5>Network Edge Protocols</h5>
				<p>
					With network edges, the primary goal is to transfer data between
					end systems. To help achieve that goal, we use protocols. For
					example, one protocol is the
					<b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b>. This is a protocol
					aimed at achieving three objectives:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Reliability.</b> TCP-compliant devices guarantee that packets
					are transferred as a stream of bytes, called a
					<i>byte stream</i>. They further that the packets are transferred
					in order. That is, packet ${4}$ will never come before packet
					${3,}$ and packet ${3}$ will always come after packet ${2.}$ This
					ensures that we don't see Sammy Sosa running all the bases and
					then cut to him hitting the homerun, or Gordon Ramsay scrambling
					eggs followed by him cracking the eggs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Importantly, reliability doesn't mean we will always get the
					data. We've all seen the live Super Bowl stream where we suddenly
					cut to a touchdown. TCP's reliability objective is that it will
					always notify clients when it fails. If data is lost, or if an
					objective is not met, TCP will acknowledge its failure and
					retransmit.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Flow control.</b> TCP-compliant <i>senders</i> guarantee that
					they will inform TCP-compliant <i>receivers</i> how much data
					they will send. This gives receivers notice, allowing them to
					prepare, decline, or inform the senders that they can no longer
					receive data. In turn, this prevents receivers from being
					overwhelmed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Congestion control.</b> Given two TCP-complaint end-hosts
					&mdash; e.g., our phone and the YouTube server &mdash; if routers
					between the two end-hosts become congested, then the server will
					slow down the rate at which it transmits packets.
				</p>
				<p>
					This congestion control ensures routers &mdash; the
					intermediaries between the YouTube server and our phone &mdash;
					aren't overwhelmed. Routers are devices too, and they have a
					finite amount of memory. If they run out of that memory, all of
					the packets comprising that Vine compilation we were watching are
					lost, and the stops.
				</p>
				<p>There are many other protocols used in network edges:</p>
				<div id="protocol_tree"></div>
				<p>
					We will examine these protocols in later sections, but here are a
					few brief descriptions for some of these protocols:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</b> is non-TCP protocol. It's a
						connectionless, unreliable data transfer protocol. Unlike TCP,
						there are no flow control or congestion control guarantees.
						UDP, however, leads to extremely fast connections. UDP is used
						for media streaming, teleconferencing, DNS, and Internet
						telephony. UDP is an ideal protocol for packet transfers where
						it would do more harm than good to retransfer information, as
						TCP does. For example, a common UDP protocol is
						<b>Domain Name Server (DNS)</b>. When we visit
						<var>bing.com</var>, our browser sends a request to a domain
						name server. That server is essentially an address book that
						matches names like <var>bing.com</var> to a specific numeric
						address called an <i>IP address</i>, which is the address of
						the server hosting <var>bing.com</var>. We can see this IP
						address by running the command
						<var>ping ⟨www.website_address.extension⟩</var>. At the time of
						this writing, it's <var>204.79.197.200</var>. This is a request
						for a very small amount of data, so it makes more sense to use
						a UDP protocol, namely, DNS.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is an application
						layer TCP protocol for establishing connections between
						different websites. It's what clients use to request data, and
						what servers use to respond with data. HTTP is fastest when the
						data transfers consist of many small files. This is the
						protocol used by the most of the websites we visit. When we go
						to <var>espn.com</var> on our laptop, our browser sends an HTTP
						request to the <var>espn.com</var> server, which then sends an
						HTTP response containing the data comprising the
						<var>espn.com</var> page that's supposed to be returned.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</b> is another application
						layer TCP protocol, used for file transfers. It's faster for
						single, large file transfers. Applications that use FTP include
						FileZilla, Transmit, WinSCP, and WS_FTP &mdash; all
						applications used for uploading, downloading, and managing
						files on a server.
					</li>
					<li><b>Telnet</b> is a TCP protocol for remote logins.</li>
					<li>
						<b>Simple Main Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</b> is a TCP protocol
						for sending and receiving email.
					</li>
					<li>

			<h4>Network Core</h4>
			<p>
				The <b>network core</b> consists of routers and networks of
				networks.
			</p>

			<h4>Access Networks & Physical Links</h4>
			<p>
				As we know, routers are the large devices that connect large parts
				of the Internet to other large parts. For example, networks in
				Japan to networks in the United States. These routers are connected
				with large, thick, fiber-optic cables.
			</p>
			<p>
				Connected to these routers are smaller, regional networks. These
				connections are established through smaller, thinner cables,
				usually either fiber optic or copper.
			</p>
			<p>
				Connected to these smaller, regional networks are
				<i>end networks</i> &mdash; residential access networks (e.g., the
				networks provided by smaller ISPs like iTV and Xfinity),
				institutional access networks (networks at school or a company),
				and mobile access networks (networks provided by cell towers).
				These networks are connected to the smaller regional networks
				either by cable or wirelessly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, connected to these end networks are our laptops, phones,
				tables, servers, and so on. These networks are connected to the
				smaller networks wirelessly (e.g., using LTE on our phone when
				we're travelling or our house's WiFi network) or by cable (e.g., an
				ethernet cable at work or a phone line).
			</p>
			<p>
				All of these connections are <b>links</b>, and they have a
				<b>bandwidth</b> &mdash; how many bits are transferred per second.
				More specficially, a link's bandwidth is the amount of frequency we
				have available for transferring packets. If a link has ${1~000~000
				\textsf{Hz}}$ of frequency, it has ${1 \textsf{MHz}}$ of bandwidth.
				The larger this bandwidth, the higher the rate at which we can
				transfer bits, called the <b>bit rate</b>, measured in bits per
				second. This is given by
				<strong>shannon's bit rate formula</strong>:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \textsf{bit rate} = \textsf{bandwidth} \times \lg \left(1 +
				\dfrac{\textsf{P}_R}{\textsf{N}_R}\right) $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				where ${\textsf{P}_R}$ is the power received by the receiver, and
				${\textsf{N}_R}$ is the noise received by the receiver. The links
				between routers &mdash; fiber optic cables &mdash; have an
				extremely large bandwidth. This is why they have bit rates of
				hundreds of gigabytes per second.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we get closer to the edge networks, the bandwidths get smaller.
				Links in these networks are simply physically smaller or are
				wireless.<sup></sup> In the days of dial-up, physical links at the
				residential access level were shared with the phone line. This led
				to top speeds of ${56 \textsf{bps}}$ (far, far slower compared to
				today's speeds). It also meant we couldn't use the phone and surf
				the Internet at the same time.
			</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					As an aside, a wireless link can never be faster than the fastest
					wired link. This is a direct result of
					<strong>shannon's bit rate formula</strong>. The term that
					ultimately determines a bit rate is the power received by the
					receiver. This is because the bandwidth term is independent of
					whether a link if wired or wireless (if the only available
					frequencies were ${2.1 \textsf{Hz}}$ to ${2.9 \textsf{Hz}}$ and
					we used all of them, we'd have the police knocking on our door
					informing us our connections were causing interferences).
				</p>
				<p>
					Because the power received by the receive is what ultimately
					impacts bit rate, wireless links can never be faster than the
					fastest wired link. Wireless transmitters send power in all
					directions radially, so only a fraction of the transmitted power
					is received by a receiver. Contrast this with a wired link, where
					<i>all</i> of the transmitted power is directed at the receiver.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Eventually, the
				<b>asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)</b
				><sup></sup> replaced dial-up, and users started seeing upload bit
				rates of ${1 \textsf{Mbps}}$ and download bit rates ${8
				\textsf{Mbps}.}$ Why was uploading slower than downloading? Because
				of the way the ISPs divided the bandwidth: A small fraction of the
				bandwidth for upstreams, and most of the bandwidth for downstreams.
				Why this division? Because this was before the era of cloud-based
				services and social media &mdash; users downloaded data more than
				they uploaded.
			</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>Or <i>DSL</i> for short.</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				After ADSL came <b>cable modems</b>, the prevailing standard today.
				These wires were a mixture of cable and fiber, connecting homes
				directly to a local ISP's router through a shared bus. Cable modems
				had much bigger bandwidths, allowing downstream bit rates of up
				${30 \textsf{Mbps}}$ and upload bit rates of ${2 \textsf{Mbps}.}$
				The cost, however, was that residents had to share the connections.
				If everyone used the connection at the same time, everyone would
				get a fraction of the available bandwidth.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ISP companies, however, were quick to rebut the concerns,
				arguing that the probability of everyone using the connection at
				the same time were negligible. Pre-pandemic, this may have been
				true (although, there are clearly peak traffic times; e.g., people
				getting home at ${6}$ and streaming Netflix while they eat dinner).
				But it certainly wouldn't have been the case during Covid times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless, plenty of people bought the argument, and the ISPs
				eventually generated enough income to increase their cable
				bandwidths, to the point where they are now the standard for
				physical links at the residential access level.<sup></sup>
			</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					Of note, some ISPs today engage in suspicious marketing
					endeavors, advertising <q>point-to-point</q> connections, where
					the connection bus splits in different directions, with each
					resident having their own access point. As much as the ISPs
					advertise these connections as <q>personal</q> or
					<q>private,</q> they're still shared connections.
				</p>

			<section id="lan">
				<h5>Local Area Networks (LAN)</h5>
				<p>
					A <b>local area network (LAN)</b> is a group of computers or
					other devies that share a wired or wireless link to a nearby edge
					router. For example, an apartment might provide free WiFi, in
					which case all of the apartment's residents share the link. Other
					examples include the computers in a hospital, a university lab,
					or corporate office. A LAN could have as few as two or three
					devices (e.g., a resident's WiFi network), or as many as several
					thousands (a large corporate office).
				</p>
				<p>
					A common technology associated with LAN is ethernet. For example,
					some hotels provide an ethernet cable for guests to use. That
					cable ultimately leads to some router in the hotel, which then
					leads to an edge router elsewhere. Ethernet connections today
					support bitrates ranging from ${10 \textsf{Mbps}}$ to ${1
					\textsf{Gbps}.}$
				</p>
				<p>
					Wireless LANs are what we're likely most familar with. Wireless
					LANs are informally called <i>WiFi networks</i>, and more
					formally called <i>802.11b/g networks</i>. When WiFi was first
					released to the public (1999), users saw bitrates of about ${2
					\textsf{Mbps}.}$ Today, we get anywhere from ${100}$ to ${200
					\textsf{Mbps}.}$
