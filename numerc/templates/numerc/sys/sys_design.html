<h1>System Design</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		Having examined the low level details of computer organization, we'll
		now launch into orbit and look at <b>software architecture</b>. Before
		we define what software architecture is, we should clearly the define
		the terms <i>software</i> is.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, software is both plural and singular. We can say
		<i>this software</i> when referring to a software, or
		<i>those software</i> when referring to multiple software. Some people
		think the phrase <i>a software</i> sounds awkward, so they instead use
		<i>a software application.</i> In these materials, we use both terms
		interchangeably &mdash; <q>a software</q> is the same as
		<q>a software application.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		As we know, a <i>program</i> is a sequence of instructions to be
		executed by a computer system. A <b>software</b>, then, is a collection
		of two or more programs for accomplishing a particular task. For
		example, suppose we wrote a program for alphabetizing names. After
		writing the program, we realize that it's pretty bare bones. We give it
		names, and it alphabetizes, but nothing more. To liven things, we write
		another program that greets the user, and provides some nice interface.
		We now have two programs working together to alphabetize names &mdash;
		one program that does all of alphabetizing, and another program for
		interacting with the user. These two programs, put together, make a
		software.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now suppose we write further software: A software that explains the
		name's origin and meaning, a software that gives common nicknames for a
		name, and a software that returns the name's popularity rank. Putting
		all of these software together, we have a <b>software system.</b> Each
		software in the software system is called an <i>element</i> of the
		software system.
	</p>
	<p>
		The term <i>software architecture</i>, then, is defined as a
		description of a software system's overall design. That description is
		set out by:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Listing each element in the software system.</li>
		<li>Describing what each element in the software system does.</li>
		<li>
			Explaining how each element in the software system relates to one
			another.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Why is software architecture important? Because a software system is a
		massive collection of programs. If copied and pasted all of a software
		system's lines of code into a single file, we'd probably see several
		million lines. The fact is, software systems are extremely complex.
		That complexity has an enormous impact on the developers charged with
		designing and implementing all the individual programs that comprise
		the software system. By having a specified software architecture,
		coordinating labor and overall production is much, much easier.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="kruchten">
	<h2>4+1 View Model</h2>
	<p>
		One of the challenges in software architecture is describing what the
		software system <i>does</i> in the first place. We could write a single
		sentence describing what the software system accomplishes &mdash;
		<q>Gives nutritional information about a product.</q> But this single
		sentence says nothing about how the software system accomplishes it,
		when it accomplishes it (i.e., how long does it take to accomplish it),
		how much it costs to accomplish it, and so on. With the exception of
		patent attorneys, few people have the ability to concisely describe a
		software system in a single sentence while conveying numerous details.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of this challenge, one way to describe what a software system
		does is to provide several different descriptions, called <b>views</b>:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Logical view</b>. This is a description of the software system's
			functionality &mdash; how the software system as a whole, and each
			element in the software system, accomplishes its tasks. To do so, we
			use <i>class diagrams</i> &mdash; a diagram showing how the software
			system's elements relate to one another, and
			<i>state diagrams</i> &mdash; a diagram showing how one element's
			state impacts another.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Process view</b>. This is a description of how well the software
			system, and each element in the software system, accomplishes its
			tasks. This is where we provide facts about the software's
			efficiency; e.g., time complexity, space complexity, network latency,
			and so on. To do so, we use <i>sequence diagrams</i> &mdash; diagrams
			displaying the execution order of different objects.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Development view</b>. This is a hierarchical description of the
			software system. Think of it like a circuit schematic of the software
			system. It shows all the different programming languages, libraries,
			toolsets, and dependencies used by the software system.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Physical view</b>. This is a description of the
			<i>physical components</i> required by the software system. Software
			is inherently tied to hardware. Whether it's computers, servers,
			mobile phones, fiber optic cables, satellites, there's always some
			piece of hardware that the software relies on. The physical view
			specifies that hardware.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Scenarios</b>. Tying all of these views together are
			<i>scenarios</i>. Scenarios aren't views &mdash; they're the use
			cases for the software. Without the scenarios, we cannot construct
			the preceding views. We must know what the software system will be
			used for, and what conditions the software system will execute under.
			Designing a web application for users with dial-up connections is
			very different from designing a web application for users on
			broadband.
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section id="tiers">
	<h2>Tiers</h2>
	<p>
		Software applications are classified in <b>tiers</b>. Some applications
		are <i>single-tier</i> (or <i>1-tier</i>), some are
		<i>two-tier</i> (<i>2-tier</i>), others are
		<i>three-tier</i> (<i>3-tier</i>) &mdash; more generally, software
		applications are class by some ${n}$-tier, where ${n}$ is the number of
		tiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what is a tier? A <b>tier</b> is a logical separation between a
		system's <b>components</b>. We can also think of it as a
		<q>layer.</q> The number ${n}$ in the term ${n}$-tier corresponds to
		the number of tiers. The system itself can have a wide variety of
		components:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>a database,</li>
		<li>a backend application server,</li>
		<li>a user interface,</li>
		<li>a messaging server,</li>
		<li>a cache server,</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		and so on. The list above contains ${5}$ items. If we separated all of
		the components above into programs that run separate machines, we would
		have a ${5}$-tier system. If we kept the backend server, messaging
		server, and cache server on machine ${1,}$ the database on machine
		${2,}$ and the user interface on machine ${3,}$ then would have a
		${3}$-tier system. We examine each of these terms in turn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many creators approach their applications with three pieces in mind:
		The <i>interface</i> (the code implementing whatever the user sees and
		interacts with), <i>logic</i> (the code implementing the application's
		decision-making process), and <i>data</i> (the code implementing how
		the application organizes and moves data). These are generalizations,
		however, and we'll find that there are many ways to create tiers.
	</p>

	<section id="single_tier">
		<h3>Single-tier Systems</h3>
		<p>
			In a <b>single-tier system</b>, the frontend (user interface),
			backend (business and program logic), and the database are all
			bundled together on the same machine. A few examples of single-tier
			applications:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><i>Mac's TextEdit</i></li>
			<li><i>Vim</i></li>
			<li><i>Emacs</i></li>
			<li><i>Gimp</i></li>
			<li><i>VLC</i></li>
			<li><i>QuickTime</i></li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			There are several benefits to implementing a system as single-tier.
		</p>

			<table class="alg">

							over someone tweaking and reverse-engineering the system.

	<section id="two_tier">
		<h3>Two-tier System</h3>
		<p>
			A <b>two-tier system</b>, also called a <b>client-server system</b>,
			is a software application that consists of two tiers:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				A <b>client</b> &mdash; which bundles the <i>user interface</i> and
				the <i>business logic</i> in a single machine.
			</li>
			<li>
				And a <b>server</b> or <b>backend server</b> &mdash; which contains
				the <i>database</i> on a separate machine.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A common example of a two-tier system is a reminder application. The
			logic and the user interface exist on the same machine, but if the
			application provides some mechanism for allowing data to
			<i>persist</i> (e.g., allow the user to see her reminders across
			different machines), the user's data is stored in some backend
			server, likely a <i>database server</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few other examples: Mobile games with persistent state. The user
			downloads the system's user interface and logic once. And to save
			game states, network calls are made to the database server.
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Benefits</th>
				<th>Costs</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Because the business logic and the user interface are kept on
						the same machine, there are fewer network calls to the backend
						server. This keeps latency low, but not as low as a single-tier
						application.
					</td>
					<td>
						Like the single-tier system, once the creator ships the system,
						UI and logic bugs can only be exterminated if the user decides
						to update.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Easy to develop, implement, and optimize. Because there are
						only two tiers, we just need to handle two separate areas.
					</td>
					<td>
						Because the system's logic is on the client side, it can be
						difficult to reuse logic, as clients have different machines.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Low cost of deployment. Because there are only two tiers,
						resources for development and management only have to be
						divided into two budgets: client (the user interface and
						logic), and server (database).
					</td>
					<td>
						<p>
							Increased cost of database maintenance. Because all of the
							deployed applications share database servers, more resources
							must be spent to ensure database servers do not fragment
							users (i.e., some users access a server one way, other users
							access another, some users have access, others do not).
						</p>
						<p>
							There's also an increased cost of database usage overall. As
							the user population increases, the number of requests made to
							the database also increases, which either (a) increases
							database usage fees or (b) slows down database performance.
						</p>
					</td>
				</tr>

	<section id="three_tier">
		<h3>Three-tier System</h3>
		<p>
			Websites like blogs and news sites are <b>three-tier systems</b>. In
			a three-tier system, the <i>user interface</i>,
			<i>business logic</i>, and <i>database</i> each exist on different
			machines, physically separated. This creates three tiers, per its
			name. For example, a news site where users can create accounts and
			post articles or comments: The user interface is likely written using
			HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (perhaps all through some framework like
			React), the logic is likely handled on an Apache server, and the
			database in MySQL.
		</p>
		<table class="alg">

				<th>Benefits</th>
				<th>Costs</th>

			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Creator has increased control over shipped systems. Logic and
						database related bugs can now be remedied.
					</td>
					<td>
						Increased latency. With a three-tier system, there are three

						logic, and the database.
					</td>

	<section id="n_tier_applications">
		<h3>${n}$-tier Applications</h3>
		<p>
			Almost all applications with gargantuan user populations &mdash;
			<i>Instagram</i>, <i>Facebook</i>, <i>TikTok</i>, <i>Uber</i>,
			<i>Airbnb</i>, <i>Instacart</i>, <i>Grubhub</i>, <i>Hinge</i>,
			<i>Pokemon Go</i>, <i>Starcraft</i>, <i>YouTube</i>,
			<i>Snapchat</i> &mdash; are <b>${n}$-tier systems</b>. These are
			systems with more than the three components of a user interface,
			backend server, or database. Some examples of such components:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				A <i>cache component</i> &mdash; code implementing the procedures
				for reading, writing, organizing, and saving cache data.
			</li>
			<li>
				A <i>messaging component</i> &mdash; code implementing how
				different components of the application communicate to one another.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Load balancer</i> &mdash; code implementing procedures for
				directing network traffic across servers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Search servers</i> &mdash; code implementing procedures for
				processing queries, indices, and returning results.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<p>
		There are many more components. Why so many components (and by
		extension, tears)? Because of two principles in software design:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The <b>single reponsibility principle (SRP)</b>, and</li>
		<li><b>separation of concerns (SoC)</b></li>
	</ol>
	<section id="srp">
		<h3>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>
		<p>
			SRP provides that a component must have one, and only one,
			responsibility. For example, if we write a component ${f}$ for
			reading a file, ${f}$ must only read that file. The component ${f}$
			should not be doing tasks like saving particular data it encounters
			or editing some other file.
		</p>
		<p>Adhering to SRP has several benefits:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong><b>loose coupling.</b></strong> A
				<i>loosely-coupled component (LCC)</i> is a component that does not
				depend on another component to perform its task. In contrast, a
				<i>tightly-coupled component (TCC)</i> is a component whose task
				can only perform its task if another component performs its task.
				Suppose ${f}$ is a component tightly coupled to another component
				${c.}$ Because ${f}$ is a TCC, changes to ${c}$ will affect how
				${f}$ performs its task.<sup></sup>
			</li>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					A loosely-coupled system is called an <i>orthogonal system</i>.
					The term <i>orthogonal</i> is borrowed from geometry. Two lines
					are orthogona if they meet at right angles. For example, the
					${\text{$x$-axis}}$ and ${\text{$y$-axis}}$ on a graph. Moving
					along the ${\text{$x$-axis}}$ has no effect on moving along the
					${\text{$y$-axis}}$ and vice versa. Following this analogy, in
					computing, two or more components are orthogonal if changes in
					one do not affect any other.
				</p>
			</div>
			<li>
				<strong><b>reduced complexity.</b></strong> The most obvious
				advantage to following SRP is reduced complexity. With every
				component having one, and only one responsibility, it's much, much
				easier to think about what the code is doing. Bugs are easier to
				spot because they can be traced to a particular component.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="SoC">
		<h3>Separation of Concerns (SoC)</h3>
		<p>
			SoC provides that an application should be separated into distinct
			sections, so that each section addresses a distinct concern with
			little overlap with other sections. We can think of a
			<b>section</b> as a collection of components working together to
			complete a particular concern. A <b>concern</b> is a large task
			composed of many smaller tasks. For example, <q>user interface</q> is
			a concern consisting of many small tasks &mdash; displaying a button,
			calculating a proportion, returning a color, and so on. This sounds
			like SRP, but the key difference is that it applies at a broader
			level &mdash; instead of components, we're thinking in terms of many
			<i>modules of components</i>.
		</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="web_architecture">
	<h2>Web Architecture</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>web architecture</b> is the way components like a database,
		message queue, cache, user interface, etc., are organized and operate
		together to produce an online service. A typical web application might
		have the following architecture:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/web_architecture_1.svg' %}"
			alt="web architecture"
			loading="lazy"
			height="130px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the architecture above, we have ${5}$ separate components (the user
		interface lies resides with the client). This is just one architecture.
		We'll lookg at a few more architectures in detail.
	</p>
	<section id="client_server">
		<h3>The Client-Server Architecture</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>client-server architecture</b> is the fundamental building
			block of the web. Almost all other web architectures are essentially
			architectures that build on top of the client-server
			architecture.<sup></sup>
			The architecture looks something like the following:
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				We say <q>almost all</q> because there is another achitecture, the
				<i>peer-to-peer architecture</i>, fairly different from the
				client-server architecture. Peer-to-peer is an uncommon
				architecture, but we will examine it in a later section.
			</p>
		</div>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/client_server_architecture.svg' %}"
				alt="client-server architecture"
				loading="lazy"
				height="60px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			In the graph above, ${q}$ indicates a <b>request</b> (i.e., a
			<i>question</i>), and ${a}$ indicates a <b>response</b> (i.e., an
			<i>answer</i>). This corresponds to the fact that the client-server
			architecture corresponds to the <b>request-response model</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the client-server architecture, the
			<i>user interface</i> resides with client. The
			<b>user interface</b> is the section for the application's
			presentation to the user. In the context of the web, the user
			interface is written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Various libraries
			may be used to help write that interface: vanilla JavaScript, jQuery,
			React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>client</b> is the entry point to the application. It might be
			a mobile application, or a browser window on some device like a
			desktop or tablet. Whatever it is, the client executes commands to
			interact with the backend server.
		</p>
		<p>There are two types of clients:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The <i>thin client</i>, and</li>
			<li>the <i>thick client</i> (or <i>fat client</i>)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A <b>thin client</b>, is a client that holds only the user interface
			of the application. With a <b>thick client</b>, the client holds both
			the user interface <em>and</em> business logic.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/thin_v_fat.svg' %}"
				alt="Thin versus fat clients"
				loading="lazy"
				height="200px"
			/>
			<figcaption>
				Where UI is the user interface and BL is the business logic.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because the thin client contains no business logic, the client must
			send requests to the backend server for logic-related requests.
			Without a connection to the backend server, the application is
			substantially limited. Contrast this with the thick client, where
			business logic resides with the client.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="web_server">
		<h3>Web Servers</h3>
		<p>
			The second component in the client-server architecture is the
			<b>backend server</b> or <b>web server</b>. The web server is the
			component that receives requests from the client and responds after
			executing the business logic according to the client's parameters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Servers that run web applications are often called
			<i>application servers</i>. But there are also various types of web
			servers:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>proxy servers</li>
			<li>mail servers</li>
			<li>file servers</li>
			<li>virtual servers</li>
			<li>data storage servers</li>
			<li>batch job server</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Server implementation depends on what the application's backend
			code's implementation. For example, if the backend code is written in
			Java, then we ought to use Apache Tomcat or Jetty. Most simple web
			applications use Apache HTTP Server. In recent years, there's been an
			increased use of
			<i>server-side rendering</i> &mdash; constructing the user interface
			on a server and sending the constructed UI to the client.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="client_server_communication">
		<h3>Client Server Communication</h3>
		<p>
			As we saw in the diagrams, the client and server communicate with one
			another &mdash; the client sends a <b>request</b>, and the server
			sends a <b>response</b> to that request. If no request is made, there
			is no response.
		</p>
		<p>
			Communications between a client and the server are governed by the
			<b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b>. We can think of HTTP as a
			set of rules defining how data is transmitted over the
			<i>world wide web</i> (i.e., the internet).
		</p>
		<section id="rest_api">
			<h4>REST API &amp; API Endpoints</h4>
			<p>
				<b>REST (Representational State Transfer)</b> is a style of
				software architecture for implementing web services. Web services
				implemented using the REST architectural style are called
				<i>RESTful web services.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				In modern ${n}$-tier web applications, all clients must hit a
				<b>REST endpoint</b> to fetch data from the web server. On the
				server side, the application code implements a <b>REST API</b>.
				This is essentially an interface for incoming requests, implemented
				under REST principles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within the context of APIs, REST architecture consists of two key
				components:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Client</b> &mdash; The entity using the the API. For example,
					a developer using the Twitter API to read and write data from
					Twitter, or a browser calling the Twitter API to render
					information on the screen.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Resource</b> &mdash; Some object that the API provides
					information about. For example, with the Twitter API, a resource
					might be trending hashtags, or with the Instagram API, an ordered
					list of most followed users.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In REST APIs, the client and the server communicate with HTTP
				methods. The client sends a request with either
				<var><mark>GET</mark></var
				>, <var><mark>POST</mark></var
				>, <var><mark>PUT</mark></var
				>, or <var><mark>DELETE</mark></var
				>, HTTP request methods. Because no information or memory is
				carried over from previous communications, all communications
				between the client and server are <i>stateless</i>. Because of this
				fact, each time a client sends a request to the server, the client
				must also send authentication information. This way, the server can
				determine if the client is authorized to read data.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the client sends a request with one of the HTTP methods, that
				request is sent to a <b>REST endpoint</b>. We can think of this as
				the URL the request is sent. That endpoint might look something
				like <var>https://servo.com/users/{username}</var>. In this case,
				the REST-based service <var>servo</var> exposes this URL to all its
				clients for to <i>fetch</i> user details.
			</p>
			<p>
				By establishing communications through REST endpoints, the client
				and server are completely decoupled. Developers can have many
				different implementations for different clients, while providing a
				common API for those implementations.
			</p>

</section>

<section id="http_methods">
	<h2>HTTP Mechanisms</h2>
	<p>
		In this section, we'll examine HTTP's <var><mark>pull</mark></var> and
		<var><mark>push</mark></var> methods. As most web communication is done
		over HTTP, knowing these methods at a greater level of detail is
		invaluable to understanding web architectures.
	</p>
	<section id="http_pull">
		<h3>HTTP Pull</h3>
		<p>
			Recall that the web communication sequence always follows the
			sequence:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Client sends a <i>request</i>.</li>
			<li>Server receives requestion.</li>
			<li>Server sends a <i>response</i>.</li>
			<li>Client receives response.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			This is the default mode of HTTP communications, and it's implemented
			through the HTTP <var><mark>pull</mark></var> method. The client
			<i>pulls</i> data from the server <i>whenever they'd like</i>.
			Because of this feature, there's a significant cost: Bandwidth
			consumption is out of the developer's hands and in the client's.
			Every request received by the server adds load to the server; the
			greater the load the greater the bandwidth consumption; the greater
			the bandwidth consumption, the more expensive it is to keep the
			servers running.
		</p>
		<p>
			But do clients really make that many requests? Depending on the
			service, yes. Web services that provide the news, sports updates,
			public health statistics, weather forecasts, and so on, might
			experience many thousands of hits from various applications,
			depending on the web service's quality. With the
			<var>pull</var> method, the client sends requests however frequently
			they'd like, even if there hasn't been any update to the data.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="http_push">
		<h3>HTTP Push</h3>
		<p>
			The HTTP <var><mark>push</mark></var> method provides an alternative
			to address this cost. The mechanism:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Client sends the server one <i>request</i>.</li>
			<li>Server receives the request.</li>
			<li>Server sends a response.</li>
			<li>Client receives the response.</li>
			<li>
				Server continues sending a response if new updates are available.
			</li>
			<li>
				Client continues receiving responses unless they communicate to the
				server to stop.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			With the <var>push</var> method, bandwidth control is back in the
			developer's hands. The part of the process where the server receives
			a request and responds only if there's an update is called a
			<i>callback</i>.
		</p>

	<h2>HTTP PULL</h2>
	<p>
		Now that we a broad overview of the the <var>PUSH</var> and
		<var>PULL</var> methods, we can examine some of the implementation
		details. Several technologies play various roles in the implementation:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ajax Long Polling</li>
		<li>Web Sockets</li>
		<li>HTML5 Event Source</li>
		<li>Message Queues</li>
		<li>Streaming over HTTP</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We examine each of these technologies in turn.</p>

		<h3>Getting Data from a Server</h3>
		<p>
			The act of getting data from a server is also called
			<b>pulling</b> or <b>fetching</b>. Clients have two ways to do so:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Sending requests by calling the HTTP
				<var><mark>GET</mark></var> method manually.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sending requests automatically at set intervals through AJAX.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<section id="get_method">
			<h4>HTTP <var>GET</var> Method</h4>
			<p>The <var>GET</var> method has the syntax:</p>

			<pre class="language-bash"><code>
				GET <i>⟨fileName.html⟩</i>
			</code></pre>

			<p>
				Here's an example of what an HTTP <var>GET</var> request might look
				like on Google Chrome:
			</p>

			<pre class="language-bash"><code>
				GET / HTTP/1.1
				Host: reqbin.com
				Connection: keep-alive
				User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.88 Safari/537.36
				Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
				Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
				Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
				Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
			</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="ajax">
			<h4>AJAX</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)</b> is how we can send
				requests automatically at set intervals. To send the requests to
				the server, AJAX uses an <b>XMLHttpRequest object</b>. This object
				is built in browser, and uses JavaScript to update the HTML DOM.
			</p>
			<p>
				The technique of automatically sending requests at set intervals is
				called <b>polling</b>, or <b>AJAX polling</b>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="ttl">
			<h4>Time to Live (TTL)</h4>
			<p>
				Under HTTP PULL, there's a specific time frame &mdash; determined
				by the browswer &mdash; for when the client should receive a
				response from the server after sending a request. This time frame
				is called
				<b>Time to Live (TTL)</b>. For example, if a browser has a TTL of
				${30 \texttt{s.},}$ then: When the client sends a request to a
				server, client must receive a response of ${30 \texttt{s.}}$ If a
				response is not received within ${30 \texttt{s.,}}$ the browser
				kills the connection, and the client must resend the request if
				needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				TTL is a means of reducing the number of connections to a server.
				Connections require memory; the more connections a server must
				maintain and track, the more memory the server must use. And with
				enough connections, the server will eventually run out of memory.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem with TTL is when we know that it will always take
				longer than the browser's TTL to receive a response. For example,
				we might know that sending a request to a particular server always
				takes ${40 \texttt{s.}}$ to receive a response from, but the
				browser has a TTL of ${30 \texttt{s.}}$ Is there a way around this
				hurdlle? Yes &mdash; a
				<b>persistent connection</b>.
			</p>
		</section>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="http_push">
	<h2>HTTP PUSH</h2>
	<p>
		With HTTP PULL, every request has a TTL of anywhere from ${30
		\textsf{s}}$ to ${60 \textsf{s.}}$ The TTL is imposed because
		otherwise, the browser would keep an open connection to the server.
		With enough open connections, the server will run out of memory and
		crash.
	</p>
	<section id="persistent_connection">
		<h3>Persistent Connection</h3>
		<p>
			A <b>persistent connection</b> is a network connection between the
			client and the server that remains open after the initial
			communication, regardless of whether a response is received within or
			outside the browser's TTL. Because the connection remains open for
			future requests, the client can send HTTP PUSH requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			This connection remains open through <b>heartbeats</b> &mdash;
			essentially blank requests and responses between the client and
			server. As long as these heartbeats keep getting sent back and forth,
			the connection remains open.
		</p>
		<p>
			Persistent connections are resource intensive. An open connection is
			an open connection, and the server must still use memory to maintain
			that connection. Persistent connections, however, are necessary for
			cetain web applications &mdash; browser-based multiplayer games,
			video-chatting, and other applications that require data to be
			constantly sent, updates or not. Fortunately, there are other HTTP
			PUSH methods and technologies.
