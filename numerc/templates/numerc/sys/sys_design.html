<h1>System Design</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		Having examined the low level details of computer organization, we'll
		now launch into orbit and look at <b>system design</b>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="tiers">
	<h2>Tiers</h2>
	<p>
		Software applications are classified in <b>tiers</b>. Some applications
		are <i>single-tier</i> (or <i>1-tier</i>), some are
		<i>two-tier</i> (<i>2-tier</i>), others are
		<i>three-tier</i> (<i>3-tier</i>) &mdash; more generally, software
		applications are class by some ${n}$-tier, where ${n}$ is the number of
		tiers.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what is a tier? A <b>tier</b> is a logical separation between a
		system's <b>components</b>. We can also think of it as a
		<q>layer.</q> The number ${n}$ in the term ${n}$-tier corresponds to
		the number of tiers. The system itself can have a wide variety of
		components:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>a database,</li>
		<li>a backend application server,</li>
		<li>a user interface,</li>
		<li>a messaging server,</li>
		<li>a cache server,</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		and so on. The list above contains ${5}$ items. If we separated all of
		the components above into programs that run separate machines, we would
		have a ${5}$-tier system. If we kept the backend server, messaging
		server, and cache server on machine ${1,}$ the database on machine
		${2,}$ and the user interface on machine ${3,}$ then would have a
		${3}$-tier system. We examine each of these terms in turn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many creators approach their applications with three pieces in mind:
		The <i>interface</i> (the code implementing whatever the user sees and
		interacts with), <i>logic</i> (the code implementing the application's
		decision-making process), and <i>data</i> (the code implementing how
		the application organizes and moves data). These are generalizations,
		however, and we'll find that there are many ways to create tiers.
	</p>

	<section id="single_tier">
		<h3>Single-tier Systems</h3>
		<p>
			In a <b>single-tier system</b>, the frontend (user interface),
			backend (business and program logic), and the database are all
			bundled together on the same machine. A few examples of single-tier
			applications:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><i>Mac's TextEdit</i></li>
			<li><i>Vim</i></li>
			<li><i>Emacs</i></li>
			<li><i>Gimp</i></li>
			<li><i>VLC</i></li>
			<li><i>QuickTime</i></li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			There are several benefits to implementing a system as single-tier.

							over someone tweaking and reverse-engineering the system.

	<section id="two_tier">
		<h3>Two-tier System</h3>
		<p>
			A <b>two-tier system</b>, also called a <b>client-server system</b>,
			is a software application that consists of two tiers:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				A <b>client</b> &mdash; which bundles the <i>user interface</i> and
				the <i>business logic</i> in a single machine.
			</li>
			<li>
				And a <b>server</b> or <b>backend server</b> &mdash; which contains
				the <i>database</i> on a separate machine.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A common example of a two-tier system is a reminder application. The
			logic and the user interface exist on the same machine, but if the
			application provides some mechanism for allowing data to
			<i>persist</i> (e.g., allow the user to see her reminders across
			different machines), the user's data is stored in some backend
			server, likely a <i>database server</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few other examples: Mobile games with persistent state. The user
			downloads the system's user interface and logic once. And to save
			game states, network calls are made to the database server.
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Benefits</th>
				<th>Costs</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Because the business logic and the user interface are kept on
						the same machine, there are fewer network calls to the backend
						server. This keeps latency low, but not as low as a single-tier
						application.
					</td>
					<td>
						Like the single-tier system, once the creator ships the system,
						UI and logic bugs can only be exterminated if the user decides
						to update.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Easy to develop, implement, and optimize. Because there are
						only two tiers, we just need to handle two separate areas.
					</td>
					<td>
						Because the system's logic is on the client side, it can be
						difficult to reuse logic, as clients have different machines.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Low cost of deployment. Because there are only two tiers,
						resources for development and management only have to be
						divided into two budgets: client (the user interface and
						logic), and server (database).
					</td>
					<td>
						<p>
							Increased cost of database maintenance. Because all of the
							deployed applications share database servers, more resources
							must be spent to ensure database servers do not fragment
							users (i.e., some users access a server one way, other users
							access another, some users have access, others do not).
						</p>
						<p>
							There's also an increased cost of database usage overall. As
							the user population increases, the number of requests made to
							the database also increases, which either (a) increases
							database usage fees or (b) slows down database performance.
						</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>

	<section id="three_tier">
		<h3>Three-tier System</h3>
		<p>
			Websites like blogs and news sites are <b>three-tier systems</b>. In
			a three-tier system, the <i>user interface</i>,
			<i>business logic</i>, and <i>database</i> each exist on different
			machines, physically separated. This creates three tiers, per its
			name. For example, a news site where users can create accounts and
			post articles or comments: The user interface is likely written using
			HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (perhaps all through some framework like
			React), the logic is likely handled on an Apache server, and the
			database in MySQL.
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Benefits</th>
				<th>Costs</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>
						Creator has increased control over shipped systems. Logic and
						database related bugs can now be remedied.
					</td>
					<td>
						Increased latency. With a three-tier system, there are three
						places that must be visited &mdash; the user interface, the
						logic, and the database.
					</td>
				</tr>

	<section id="n_tier_applications">
		<h3>${n}$-tier Applications</h3>
		<p>
			Almost all applications with gargantuan user populations &mdash;
			<i>Instagram</i>, <i>Facebook</i>, <i>TikTok</i>, <i>Uber</i>,
			<i>Airbnb</i>, <i>Instacart</i>, <i>Grubhub</i>, <i>Hinge</i>,
			<i>Pokemon Go</i>, <i>Starcraft</i>, <i>YouTube</i>,
			<i>Snapchat</i> &mdash; are <b>${n}$-tier systems</b>. These are
			systems with more than the three components of a user interface,
			backend server, or database. Some examples of such components:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				A <i>cache component</i> &mdash; code implementing the procedures
				for reading, writing, organizing, and saving cache data.
			</li>
			<li>
				A <i>messaging component</i> &mdash; code implementing how
				different components of the application communicate to one another.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Load balancer</i> &mdash; code implementing procedures for
				directing network traffic across servers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Search servers</i> &mdash; code implementing procedures for
				processing queries, indices, and returning results.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<p>
		There are many more components. Why so many components (and by
		extension, tears)? Because of two principles in software design:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The <b>single reponsibility principle (SRP)</b>, and</li>
		<li><b>separation of concerns (SoC)</b></li>
	</ol>
	<section id="srp">
		<h3>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>
		<p>
			SRP provides that a component must have one, and only one,
			responsibility. For example, if we write a component ${f}$ for
			reading a file, ${f}$ must only read that file. The component ${f}$
			should not be doing tasks like saving particular data it encounters
			or editing some other file.
		</p>
		<p>Adhering to SRP has several benefits:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong><b>Loose Coupling.</b></strong> A
				<i>loosely-coupled component (LCC)</i> is a component that does not
				depend on another component to perform its task. In contrast, a
				<i>tightly-coupled component (TCC)</i> is a component whose task
				can only perform its task if another component performs its task.
				Suppose ${f}$ is a component tightly coupled to another component
				${c.}$ Because ${f}$ is a TCC, changes to ${c}$ will affect how
				${f}$ performs its task.<sup></sup>
			</li>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					A loosely-coupled system is called an <i>orthogonal system</i>.
					The term <i>orthogonal</i> is borrowed from geometry. Two lines
					are orthogona if they meet at right angles. For example, the
					${\text{$x$-axis}}$ and ${\text{$y$-axis}}$ on a graph. Moving
					along the ${\text{$x$-axis}}$ has no effect on moving along the
					${\text{$y$-axis}}$ and vice versa. Following this analogy, in
					computing, two or more components are orthogonal if changes in
					one do not affect any other.
				</p>
			</div>
			<li>
				<strong>Reduced Complexity.</strong> The most obvious advantage to
				following SRP is reduced complexity. With every component having
				one, and only one responsibility, it's much, much easier to think
				about what the code is doing. Bugs are easier to spot because they
				can be traced to a particular component.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="SoC">
		<h3>Separation of Concerns (SoC)</h3>
		<p>
			SoC provides that an application should be separated into distinct
			sections, so that each section addresses a distinct concern with
			little overlap with other sections. We can think of a
			<b>section</b> as a collection of components working together to
			complete a particular concern. A <b>concern</b> is a large task
			composed of many smaller tasks. For example, <q>user interface</q> is
			a concern consisting of many small tasks &mdash; displaying a button,
			calculating a proportion, returning a color, and so on. This sounds
			like SRP, but the key difference is that it applies at a broader
			level &mdash; instead of components, we're thinking in terms of many
			<i>modules of components</i>.
		</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="web_architecture">
	<h2>Web Architecture</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>web architecture</b> is the way components like a database,
		message queue, cache, user interface, etc., are organized and operate
		together to produce an online service. A typical web application might
		have the following architecture:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/web_architecture_1.svg' %}"
			alt="web architecture"
			loading="lazy"
			height="130px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the architecture above, we have ${5}$ separate components (the user
		interface lies resides with the client). This is just one architecture.
		We'll lookg at a few more architectures in detail.
	</p>
	<section id="client_server">
		<h3>The Client-Server Architecture</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>client-server architecture</b> is the fundamental building
			block of the web. Almost all other web architectures are essentially
			architectures that build on top of the client-server
			architecture.<sup></sup>
			The architecture looks something like the following:
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				We say <q>almost all</q> because there is another achitecture, the
				<i>peer-to-peer architecture</i>, fairly different from the
				client-server architecture. Peer-to-peer is an uncommon
				architecture, but we will examine it in a later section.
			</p>
		</div>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/client_server_architecture.svg' %}"
				alt="client-server architecture"
				loading="lazy"
				height="60px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			In the graph above, ${q}$ indicates a <b>request</b> (i.e., a
			<i>question</i>), and ${a}$ indicates a <b>response</b> (i.e., an
			<i>answer</i>). This corresponds to the fact that the client-server
			architecture corresponds to the <b>request-response model</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the client-server architecture, the
			<i>user interface</i> resides with client. The
			<b>user interface</b> is the section for the application's
			presentation to the user. In the context of the web, the user
			interface is written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Various libraries
			may be used to help write that interface: vanilla JavaScript, jQuery,
			React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>client</b> is the entry point to the application. It might be
			a mobile application, or a browser window on some device like a
			desktop or tablet. Whatever it is, the client executes commands to
			interact with the backend server.
		</p>
		<p>There are two types of clients:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The <i>thin client</i>, and</li>
			<li>the <i>thick client</i> (or <i>fat client</i>)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A <b>thin client</b>, is a client that holds only the user interface
			of the application. With a <b>thick client</b>, the client holds both
			the user interface <em>and</em> business logic.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/thin_v_fat.svg' %}"
				alt="Thin versus fat clients"
				loading="lazy"
				height="200px"
			/>
			<figcaption>
				Where UI is the user interface and BL is the business logic.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because the thin client contains no business logic, the client must
			send requests to the backend server for logic-related requests.
			Without a connection to the backend server, the application is
			substantially limited. Contrast this with the thick client, where
			business logic resides with the client.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="web_server">
		<h3>Web Servers</h3>
		<p>
			The second component in the client-server architecture is the
			<b>backend server</b> or <b>web server</b>. The web server is the
			component that receives requests from the client and responds after
			executing the business logic according to the client's parameters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Servers that run web applications are often called
			<i>application servers</i>. But there are also various types of web
			servers:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>proxy servers</li>
			<li>mail servers</li>
			<li>file servers</li>
			<li>virtual servers</li>
			<li>data storage servers</li>
			<li>batch job server</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Server implementation depends on what the application's backend
			code's implementation. For example, if the backend code is written in
			Java, then we ought to use Apache Tomcat or Jetty. Most simple web
			applications use Apache HTTP Server. In recent years, there's been an
			increased use of
			<i>server-side rendering</i> &mdash; constructing the user interface
			on a server and sending the constructed UI to the client.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="client_server_communication">
		<h3>Client Server Communication</h3>
		<p>
			As we saw in the diagrams, the client and server communicate with one
			another &mdash; the client sends a <b>request</b>, and the server
			sends a <b>response</b> to that request. If no request is made, there
			is no response.
		</p>
		<p>
			Communications between a client and the server are governed by the
			<b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b>. We can think of HTTP as a
			set of rules defining how data is transmitted over the
			<i>world wide web</i> (i.e., the internet).
		</p>
		<section id="rest_api">
			<h4>REST API &amp; API Endpoints</h4>
			<p>
				<b>REST (Representational State Transfer)</b> is a style of
				software architecture for implementing web services. Web services
				implemented using the REST architectural style are called
				<i>RESTful web services.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				In modern ${n}$-tier web applications, all clients must hit a
				<b>REST endpoint</b> to fetch data from the web server. On the
				server side, the application code implements a <b>REST API</b>.
				This is essentially an interface for incoming requests, implemented
				under REST principles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within the context of APIs, REST architecture consists of two key
				components:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Client</b> &mdash; The entity using the the API. For example,
					a developer using the Twitter API to read and write data from
					Twitter, or a browser calling the Twitter API to render
					information on the screen.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Resource</b> &mdash; Some object that the API provides
					information about. For example, with the Twitter API, a resource
					might be trending hashtags, or with the Instagram API, an ordered
					list of most followed users.
				</li>
			</ol>
