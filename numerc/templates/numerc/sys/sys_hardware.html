<h1>Computer Hardware: An Overview</h1>
<section id="hardware">
	<h2>The Hardware</h2>
	<p>
		If we drew a rough sketch of how a computer is organized, it would look
		something like this:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/hardware.svg' %}"
			alt="hardware"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If this picture looks fairly complex, don't worry. One of our goals is to
		fill in the details. To get started, let's just go over a few key parts.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we study computer hardware, it's often helpful to think of the whole
		system as a busy metropolis, where different places rely on one another. The
		whole city is powered by electricity, and its inhabitants are the bits, tiny
		creatures that are either 1 or 0. The bits usually work in groups of 8,
		forming a byte. The city's ultimate goal is facilitating the movement of
		these bits, and more broadly, bytes.
	</p>

		<span class="topic">Buses.</span> In the diagram above, there are blue lines
		connecting each of the hardware pieces. These are called
		<span class="term">buses</span>. Despite their name, buses are better
		thought of as lanes, or roads, where bytes travel from one location in
		hardware to the next. The buses are typically designed to transfer one group
		of bytes at a time. That group is called a <span class="term">word</span>.
		On most systems, a word consists of either 4 bytes (32 bits) or 8 bytes (64
		bits).
