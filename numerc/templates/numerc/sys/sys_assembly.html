<h1>Assembly</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<div id="nandGate"></div>
	<p>
		In this module, we examine some basic ideas in assembly language. This
		will provide much of the foundations for later discussions. To do so,
		we will use the <b>6502 Assembly Language</b>, as employed on the Atari
		2600 (<q>the 2600</q>) platform. Such a simple platform is used for
		several reasons: (1) It allows us to avoid having to address the
		enormous stretches of complexity on modern devices, and (2) it captures
		most, if not all, of the most important ideas in assembly and computer
		architecture concisely.
	</p>
	<p>The Atari 2600's hardware at a glance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The 2600 uses a 6507 processor, running at ${1.19~\text{MHz}}$
			(${1.19 \times 10^6}$ instructions per second). Atari originally
			selected the 6502 processor, but in production, the cheaper version,
			6507, was used. Both architectures are similar, but we'll note a few
			differences as we proceed. Of note, the 6502 powered many computers:
			the Apple II, various Commodore machines, the Tamagotchi, NES, and
			Bender from <i>Futurama</i>.
		</li>
		<li>
			For audio and video, the 2600 uses a TIA (Television Interface
			Adapter) chip.
		</li>
		<li>
			In terms of RAM (<q>Read-Access Memory</q>), the 2600 employs a 6532
			RIOT (<q>RAM Input Output Timer</q>) Chip, capable of storing &mdash;
			wait for it &mdash; 128 bytes. Yes, that's all we get.
		</li>
		<li>
			In terms of ROM (<q>Read-Only Memory,</q> i.e., the game catridge),
			we have ${4~\text{kB}}$ to work with. The ROM is where we will read
			our instructins from for the 2600's processor.
		</li>
		<li>
			For input, we're working with two controller ports, connecting some
			non-keyboard peripheral &mdash; e.g., a joystick.
		</li>
		<li>
			For output, the 2600 uses a <b>cathode-ray tube (CRT) television</b>.
			Note that <i>CRT TVs</i> are different from <i>CRT Monitors</i>.
			We're operating under the assumption of working with a CRT TV, not a
			CRT monitor.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We should now see why the Atari 2600 is an ideal medium for exploring
		assembly programming. We're working with extremely tight constraints:
		The processor can only do so much; audio and video have to be manually
		taken care of; the set of possible user inputs is small; and memory is
		unquestionably scarce.

	<h2>Signals</h2>
	<p>
		Before we get to a functioning computer, we must assemble its
		components. Before we assemble its components, we must understand
		Boolean logic from the computer's perspective. And before we understand
		the computer's perspective, we must understand what <i>bits</i> are.
		And to understand what bits are, we must study <b>signals</b>.
	</p>

	<section id="whats_a_signal">
		<h3>What's a Signal?</h3>
		<p>
			If we look at the Great Wall of China, we see that it's not just some
			massive, vertical wall. It has considerable thickness for people to
			travel along the wall. Every few meters or so, there's a large tower.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/great_wall_of_china.svg' %}"
				alt=""
				loading="lazy"
				style="width: 200px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			These large, protruding structures are called <i>beacon towers</i>.
			They were used for storing supplies and sheltering soldiers. But more
			importantly, they were used to transmit messages. When a sentinel saw
			intruders approaching during the day, the soldier would set smoke (if
			the threat occurred during the day) or light a fire (if the threat
			occurred at night). The sentinel in the neighboring tower would see
			the signal and perform the same, that tower's neighboring tower would
			see the signal and do the same, and that tower's neighbor, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			The message transmitted was simple: Smoke or fire, there was an
			intruder; else, just another day along the wall. This was a fairly
			limited form of communication. More complicated messages like
			<q>Running low on water at tower ${5}$</q> had to be delivered by
			messenger. Nevertheless, China's beacon towers present a
			straightforward introduction to the notion of a <i>signal</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mathematically, a <b>signal</b> is just a function ${s(t).}$ What
			separates it from other functions, however, is what it represents:
			The variation of some <i>physical quantity</i> with respect to some
			parameter, most commonly <i>time</i>. Because it measure some
			physical quantity, the key characteristic of a signal is that its
			range is an <i>interval</i> &mdash; a set consisting of real numbers
			between some real number ${a}$ and a real number ${b.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, for the soldiers along the Great Wall, the signal can be
			mathematically modeled as:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ s(\text{beacon}) = \begin{cases}
			\text{intruder}~~~~~~~~~~\text{if}~~~\text{beacon} \in \{ \text{fire,
			smoke} \} \\ \text{no intruder}~~~~~\text{else} \end{cases} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			We can write this more abstractly. Denote ${\text{beacon}}$ as ${b,}$
			the existence of a fire or smoke as ${1,}$ and the nonexistence of a
			fire or smoke as ${0:}$
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ s(b) = \begin{cases} \exists(\text{intruder}) ~~~ b=1 \\
			\nexists(\text{intruder}) ~~~b=0 \end{cases} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			From this definition of a signal, we can see that many kinds of
			functions qualify as signals. For example, if we took temperature
			readings on a particular from ${8}$AM to ${8}$PM and found that the
			trendline resembled a graph ${2t^2,}$ the function ${T(t) = 2t^2}$
			constitutes a signal. Plug in a time, and we get back a
			<i>variation</i> of the temperature. This is the defining
			characteristic of a signal: it's a function that returns some
			<i>object</i> &mdash; perhaps a number, or the fact that an intruder
			is approaching &mdash; from an interval.
		</p>
		<p>
			For electronics, e.g., a computer, a signal is a function
			representing some variation in a measurement of electricity with
			respect to time. That measurement could be electrical voltage or a
			pulse of current. For our purposes, we'll think of the measure in
			terms of current pulses, but really, it doesn't matter. The important
			point is that the measurement is one among a finite set of possible
			measurements.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="analog_v_digital">
		<h3>Analog versus Digital</h3>
		<p>
			The terms <i>analog</i> and <i>digital</i> refer to the signal's
			codomain. For example, the sine function, ${y = \sin(x),}$ is an
			<b>analog signal</b>. Its codomain is the interval ${\{ y \in \R \mid
			-1 \leq y \leq 1 \}.}$ We say classify it as an analog signal because
			it can output infinitely many signals &mdash; there are infinitely
			many real numbers between ${-1}$ and ${1.}$
		</p>
		<div id="sine_graph"></div>
		<p>
			A <b>digital signal</b>, however, restricts the codomain to a subset
			of the analog signal's codomain. For example, consider the function:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ s(t) = \dfrac{\sin(2 \pi f t)}{2\lvert \sin(2 \pi f t) \rvert } +
			\dfrac{1}{2} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Where ${f,}$ the <i>frequency</i>, is ${1,}$ and ${t}$ is the time.
			This function results in a <b>square wave</b> whose graph appears as:
		</p>
		<div id="analog_sine_graph"></div>
		<p>
			Notice that we've now restricted the codomain even further: The
			signal can only be ${0}$ or ${1.}$ This is a key feature of digital
			signals, and it is what's used by electronic devices to make the
			measurements of electricity we mentioned earlier. Interpreting the
			graph above, the ${y}$-axis is the electrical measurement &mdash;
			perhaps volts (units of voltage) or amperes (units of electric
			current) &mdash; and the ${x}$-axis is time.
		</p>
		<p>
			In essence, restricting the domain means we're restricting the number
			of possible outputs. And by restricting the number of possible
			outputs to just two &mdash; ${0}$ or ${1}$ &mdash; we enter a world
			where pretty much everything is black and white, true or false. This
			greatly reduces complexity, because now we can model everything with
			a switch:
		</p>
		<div id="bit_1"></div>
		<p>
			This single switch is called a <b>bit</b>. Using enough of these
			bits, we can implement Boolean and arithmetic operations. And from
			these basic operations, we can emulate <i>memory</i>, all the way up
			to a full-fledged, functioning computer.

<section id="boolean_logic">
	<h2>Boolean Logic</h2>
	<p>
		In the world of computing, there are only two values: <var>0</var> and
		<var>1.</var> With just <var>0</var> and <var>1</var>, we can perform a
		wide variety of operations.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">AND.</span> The logical <var>AND</var> has the
		following truth table:
	</p>
	<div id="and_truth_table"></div>
	<p>
		Formally, the logical <var>AND</var> is represented with the symbol
		${\land,}$ or, in the case of bitwise operations, the ampersand
		<var>&amp;</var>. The operation <var>a∧b</var> returns true if, and
		only if, both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are true. Otherwise, it
		returns false.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">OR.</span> The logical <var>OR</var> has the
		following truth table:
	</p>
	<div id="or_truth_table"></div>
	<p>
		In formal logic, the logical <var>OR</var> is represented with the
		symbol ${\lor,}$ or, in bitwise notation, the pipe character
		<var>|</var>. Examining the truth table, we see that
		<var>a|b</var> returns false if and only if <var>a</var> and
		<var>b</var> are both false. Otherwise, it returns true.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">NOT.</span> The logical <var>NOT</var> is a
		<i>unary operator</i>. In formal logic, we represent the logical
		<var>NOT</var> with the symbol ${\neg,}$ and in bitwise logic, we use
		the exclamation mark <var>!</var> (some texts use the tilde,
		<var>~</var>). The truth table:
	</p>
	<div id="not_truth_table"></div>
	<p>
		With just these three operations &mdash; <var>AND</var>, <var>OR</var>,
		and <var>NOT</var> &mdash; we can create much more elaborate and
		complex operations.
	</p>

	<section id="boolean_identities">
		<h3>Logical Equivalences</h3>
		<p>
			Like the algebraic identities, Boolean logic also has laws like
			commutativity, associativity, and so on. These laws are called
			<b>logical equivalences</b> because their proofs are established by
			the fact that ${a \equiv b}$ if and only if ${a}$ is logically
			equivalent to ${b.}$
		</p>
		<h4>Identity Laws</h4>
		<p>The identity laws provide that:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} x \land 1 \equiv x \\ x \lor 0 \equiv x
			\end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			In other words, the conjunction of some variable signal ${x}$ and a
			signal that's always ${1}$ will always return the variable signal
			${x.}$ Similarly, the disjunction of some variable signal ${x}$ and a
			signal that's always ${0}$ will always return the variable signal
			${x.}$ The proof:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & x \land y & x \lor z \\
			\hline & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<h4>Domination Laws</h4>
		<p>The domination laws state:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} x &\lor 1 \equiv 1 \\ x &\land 0 \equiv 0
			\end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			This domination laws provide that if we have a variable signal ${x}$
			and a constant signal ${y,}$ then if ${y = 1,}$ the disjunction
			returns ${1,}$ and if ${y = 0,}$ the conjunction returns ${0.}$ The
			proof:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & x \land y & x \lor y \\ \hline
			& 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ & 1 & 1 & 1
			& 1 \\ \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<h4>Indemponent Laws</h4>
		<p>
			The word
			<q>indemponent</q> is a mathematical term: An operation is
			<i>indemponent</i> if it can be applied multiple times without
			changing the result beyond the initial application. For example, the
			constant function ${f(x) = 2}$ is indempotent. No matter how many
			times we apply it (i.e., passing different values of ${x}$), we will
			always get back ${2.}$ Similarly, the absolute value operator is
			indempotent: ${\lvert x \rvert = \lvert \lvert x \rvert \rvert
			=\lvert \lvert \lvert x \rvert \rvert \rvert.}$ Not matter how many
			times we apply it, we will always get back ${\lvert x \rvert.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			The same phenomenon exists in Boolean logic through the indempotent
			laws:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Indempotent Laws</small>
			<p>Where ${x}$ is logically equivalent to ${y:}$</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} x \lor y &\equiv x \\ x \land y &\equiv y
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
		</dfn>
		<p>The proof:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & x \land y & x \lor y \\ \hline
			& 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Note that this implies a corollary:</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Corollary</small>
			<p>Where ${x}$ is logically equivalent to ${y:}$</p>
			<figure>$$ x \land y \equiv x \lor y $$</figure>
		</dfn>

		<section id="double_negation">
			<h4>Double Negation Laws</h4>
			<p>
				The double negation law is similar to the
				<cite>odd-even sign rule</cite> in mathematics. Recall that the
				odd-even sign rule provides that:
			</p>
			<dfn>
				<small>Odd-Even Sign Rule</small>
				<p>Where ${n \in \Z,}$</p>
				<figure>
					$$ (-1)^n = \begin{cases} 1 ~~~\text{if}~~ n \in \Z_{\text{even}}
					\\ -1 ~~~\text{if}~~ n \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \end{cases} $$
				</figure>
			</dfn>
			<p>
				In other words, ${-1}$ raised to an even number power returns ${1}$
				(e.g., ${-1 \cdot -1 = 1}$) while ${-1}$ raised to an odd number
				power returns ${-1}$ (e.g., ${-1 \cdot -1 \cdot -1 = -1}$). The
				same idea applies to the <var>NOT</var> operator. ${\neg(\neg x)
				\equiv x}$ and ${\neg (\neg (\neg x)) \equiv \neg x.}$
			</p>
			<dfn>
				<small>Double Negation Law</small>
				<p>Where ${x}$ is some signal:</p>
				<figure>$$ \neg (\neg x) \equiv x $$</figure>
			</dfn>
			<p>The proof:</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & x & \neg x & \neg(\neg x) \\ \hline & 0
				& 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{array} $$
			</figure>
		</section>

		<section id="commutative_law">
			<h4>Commutative Law</h4>
			<p>
				The Boolean commutative law provides that inter-changing the order
				of operands in a Boolean equation does not change its result:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} (x \land y) &\equiv (y \land x) \\ (x \lor y)
				&\equiv (y \lor x) \end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>For example, consider the following propositions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>${n &lt; m}$ and ${m &lt; w}$</li>
				<li>${m &lt; w}$ and ${n &lt; m}$</li>
				<li>${a &lt; b}$ or ${a = b}$</li>
				<li>${a = b}$ or ${a &lt; b}$</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The commutative law provides that the propositions (1) and (2) are
				the same. In other words, it doesn't matter if we determine whether
				${n}$ is less than ${m}$ first, or if we determine ${m}$ is less
				than ${w}$ first. This idea is encapsulated in the expression ${n
				&lt; m &lt; w.}$ It also provides that propositions (3) and (4) are
				the same. It doesn't matter whether we determine that ${a}$ is less
				than ${b}$ first, or if we determine that ${a = b}$ first. Hence
				the encapsulating expression ${a \leq b.}$
			</p>
			<p>
				The Boolean commutative law is closely related to the commutative
				law of set theory:
			</p>
			<div class="tripart">
				<figure>
					$$ \begin{aligned} A \cup B &= B \cup A \\ A \cap B &= B \cap A
					\\ \end{aligned} $$

					/>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<p>
				In the diagram above, ${\text{card}(A) = 6}$ and ${\text{card}(B) =
				5.}$ To determine the cardinality of ${A}$ and ${B}$ combined, it
				doesn't matter if we count the number of elements in ${A}$ first or
				the number of elements in ${B}$ first. We still get:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \text{card}(A \cup B) &= \text{card}(B \cup A) =
				\text{card}(A) + \text{card}(B) - \text{card}(A \cap B) \\ &= 6 + 5
				- 2 \\ &= 9 \end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>The same goes for intersection:</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \text{card}(A \cap B) &= \text{card}(A) +
				\text{card}(B) - \text{card}(A \cup B) \\ &= 6 + 5 - 9 \\ &= 11 -

		<h3>Boolean Expressions</h3>

			Because <var>AND</var>, <var>OR</var>, and <var>NOT</var> are

			<b>Boolean expressions</b>. For example, here's a simple Boolean

		<figure>$$ \neg (0 \lor (1 \land 1)) $$</figure>

			Unlike real functions, Boolean functions have a finite number of

		<h3>Constructing Boolean Functions</h3>
		<p>Suppose we were given the following truth table:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
			\\ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 0 &
			0 & 1 \\ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
			\end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			We want to construct a Boolean function that produces this truth
			table. The trick to doing so is to focus on one row at a time: First,
			write a function that particular row, apply it to the rest of the
			values. Second, focus on another row that doesn't match, write a
			function for that particular row, apply it, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>For example, let's focus on the first row:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f \\ \hline &
			\color{salmon} 0 & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{salmon} 0 &
			\color{salmon} 1 \\ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1
			& 0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ & 1 &
			1 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			A function that produces this row would be: ${(\neg x) \land (\neg y)
			\land (\neg z):}$
		</p>
	</section>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f & (\neg x) \land (\neg y)
		\land (\neg z) \\ \hline & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{salmon} 0 &
		\color{salmon} 0 & \color{salmon} 1 & \color{salmon} 1 \\ & 0 & 0 & 1 &
		0 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ & 0 & 1 &
		1 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ & 1 &
		0 & 1 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ &
		1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>We then consider the next ${1}$ output:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
		\\ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 1 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ & 1 &
		0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		A possible function would be: ${(\neg x) \land y \land (\neg z).}$ This
		results in the truth table:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f & (\neg x) \land y \land
		(\neg z) \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 \\ & 0 &
		0 & 1 & 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 \\ & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 1 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 1 & \color{cornflowerblue} 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0
		& \color{cornflowerblue} 0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \color{cornflowerblue}
		0 \\ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0
		\\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		That takes care of the second ${1}$ output. Now we write a function for
		the third ${1}$ output:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
		\\ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ &
		\color{green} 1 & \color{green} 0 & \color{green} 0 & \color{green} 1
		\\ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array}
		$$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here a possible function is ${x \land (\neg y) \land (\neg z),}$
		yielding the truth table:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f & x \land (\neg y) \land
		(\neg z) \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \color{green} 0 \\ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
		& \color{green} 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & \color{green} 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 &
		0 & \color{green} 0 \\ & \color{green} 1 & \color{green} 0 &
		\color{green} 0 & \color{green} 1 & \color{green} 1 \\ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0
		& \color{green} 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \color{green} 0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 &
		0 & \color{green} 0 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Putting it all together, we get:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & z & f & \color{salmon} (\neg x)
		\land (\neg y) \land (\neg z) & \color{cornflowerblue} (\neg x) \land y
		\land (\neg z) & \color{green} x \land (\neg y) \land (\neg z) \\
		\hline & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{salmon} 0 &
		\color{salmon} 1 & \color{salmon} 1 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{green} 0 \\ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 0 & \color{green} 0 \\ & \color{cornflowerblue}
		0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 1 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 1 & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 1
		& \color{green} 0 \\ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 &
		\color{cornflowerblue} 0 & \color{green} 0 \\ & \color{green} 1 &
		\color{green} 0 & \color{green} 0 & \color{green} 1 & \color{salmon} 0
		& \color{cornflowerblue} 0 & \color{green} 1 \\ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 &
		\color{salmon} 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 & \color{green} 0 \\ & 1 &
		1 & 0 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 & \color{green}
		0 \\ & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \color{salmon} 0 & \color{cornflowerblue} 0 &
		\color{green} 0 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		All that's left to do is to just string these three functions with
		<var>OR</var> operators:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f(x, y, z) = [(\neg x) \land (\neg y) \land (\neg z)] \lor [(\neg x)
		\land y \land (\neg z)] \lor [x \land (\neg y) \land (\neg z)] $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Although this function is correct, it's fairly complex. A better
		definition would be to simplify the expression. First, examining the
		first two functions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} & [(\neg x) \land (\neg y) \land (\neg z)] \\ &
		[(\neg x) \land y \land (\neg z)] \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		we see that in both of these expressions, we have ${(\neg x)}$ and
		${(\neg z).}$ This means that the only fixed values are ${(\neg x)}$
		and ${(\neg z).}$ The value for ${(\neg y)}$ is captured in both
		expressions. Thus, all we really need to know is ${(\neg x)}$ and
		${(\neg z):}$
	</p>
	<figure>$$ (\neg x) \land (\neg z) $$</figure>
	<p>This reduces our function definition to:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f(x, y, z) = [(\neg x) \land (\neg z)] \lor [x \land (\neg y) \land
		(\neg z)] $$
	</figure>
	<p>We can then reduce the term:</p>
	<figure>$$ [x \land (\neg y) \land (\neg z)] $$</figure>
	<p>to:</p>
	<figure>$$ [(\neg y) \land (\neg z)] $$</figure>
	<p>resulting in the definition:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f(x, y, z) = [(\neg x) \land (\neg z)] \lor [(\neg y) \land (\neg
		z)] $$
	</figure>
	<p>From there we can reduce the definition even further:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f(x, y, z) = (\neg z) \land [(\neg x) \lor (\neg y)] $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		As we might be able to tell, constructing Boolean functions from a
		given truth table is a difficult task. Moreover, finding the shortest
		possible equivalent expression for a given Boolean expression is an
		NP-complete problem. There is no algorithm for finding such an
		expression. This means that, at the moment, a significant aspect of
		designing the logic circuits behind processors depends on human
		ingenuity and labor.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's more remarkable, however, is that we've seen a demonstration of
		the following theorem:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Canonical Representation Theorem</small>
		<p>
			Any Boolean function can be represented using the operations of
			${\land}$ (<var>AND</var>), ${\lor}$ (<var>OR</var>), and ${\neg}$
			(<var>NOT</var>).
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		This is a very special theorem. It is because of this theorem that
		computers exist. It turns out, however, that we don't actually need the
		<var>OR</var> operator. We can get away with just <var>AND</var> and
		<var>NOT</var>. This is because the <var>OR</var> operator can be
		expressed with <var>AND</var> and <var>NOT</var>, following De Morgan's
		laws:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ x \lor y \equiv \neg(\neg x) \land (\neg y) $$</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we have the more generalized form of the theorem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>General Canonical Representation Theorem</small>
		<p>
			Any Boolean function can be represented using the operations of
			${\land}$ (<var>AND</var>) and ${\neg}$ (<var>NOT</var>).
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>But we can go even a step further:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>NAND Representation Theorem</small>
		<p>
			Any Boolean function can be represented using the ${\uparrow}$
			(<var>NAND</var>) operator.
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		The <var>NAND</var> (<var>NOT AND</var>) operator is the result of the
		function:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ f(x,y) = x \uparrow y \equiv \neg (x \land y) $$</figure>
	<p>The truth table:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c:c} & x & y & x \land y & \neg(x \land y)
		\equiv x \uparrow y \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ & 1
		& 0 & 0 & 1 \\ & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		The proof of the <cite>NAND representation theorem</cite> stems from
		the fact that we can represent <var>AND</var> and <var>NOT</var> with
		<var>NAND</var>. From the
		<cite>General Canonical Representation Theorem</cite>, we know that
		every Boolean function can be be represented using <var>AND</var> and
		<var>NOT</var>, so if we can write these two operations with
		<var>NAND</var>, the <cite>NAND representation theorem</cite> directly
		follows. In this case, we can. The <var>NOT</var> operation is simply:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \neg x \equiv \neg (x \land x) \equiv x \uparrow x $$</figure>
	<p>and the <var>AND</var> operation is just:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} x \land y &\equiv \neg (\neg(x \land y)) \\ &\equiv
		\neg (x \uparrow y) \\ &\equiv (x \uparrow y) \uparrow (x \uparrow y)
		\end{aligned} $$

	<h2>Logic Gates</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>logic gate</b> is a device that implements some functionality that
		can be modeled with Boolean functions. There are two kinds of logic
		gates: <b>elementary gates</b> (gates that implement a strictly Boolean
		operation) and <b>composite gates</b> (gates that a functionality
		beyond a strictly Boolean operation, e.g., addition, multiplication,
		etc.). We begin by covering a few elementary gates.

			We might be wondering, how exactly do these gates work physically?
			This is a fair question, because the gate schematics are really an

	<section id="hardware_description_language">
		<h3>Hardware Description Language</h3>
		<p>
			When we're asked to design a logic gate, we want to always ask for as
			much information as we can. This means we always want to possibly
			construct a truth table. For example, suppose the client asks for a
			gate that:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<p>
				Outputs <var>1</var> if and only if one of its two inputs is
				<var>1</var>.
			</p>
		</figure>
		<p>Specifying this as a truth table:</p>
		<div id="xor_truth_table"></div>
		<p>This particular gate is called a <b>XOR gate</b>:</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/xor_gate.svg' %}"
				alt="or circuit"
				loading="lazy"
				style="width: 130px"
			/>
			<figcaption><var>XOR</var> gate</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			With this information, we can specify this design through
			<b>hardware description language (HDL)</b> &mdash; a computer
			language for describing the structure and behavior of digital logic
			circuits. For the <var>XOR</var> gate, we would write the following
			in an <var>.hdl</var> file:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			/** Xor gate: out = (a And Not(b)) Or (Not(a) And b)) */
			CHIP Xor {
				IN a, b;
				OUT out;

				PARTS:
				// Implementation goes here
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			In the code above, the implementation (currently noted as
			"Implementation missing") is written in an HDL stub file. To write
			this implementation, we'll need to come up with a way to implement
			<var>XOR</var> using the gates we already have, <var>AND</var>,
			<var>OR</var>, <var>NOT</var>, and <var>NAND</var>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so, we take a closer look at the truth table. In this case, we
			see that there are only two cases where the output is <var>1</var>:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<var>a</var> is <var>0</var> and <var>b</var> is <var>1.</var>
			</li>
			<li>
				<var>a</var> is <var>1</var> and <var>b</var> is <var>0</var>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Accordingly, we have the diagram:</p>

				src="{% static 'images/XOR_implementation.svg' %}"
				alt="or circuit"
				loading="lazy"
				style="width: 350px"

			<figcaption><var>XOR</var> implementation</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>In our <var>hdl</var> file, we write:</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			/** Xor gate: out = (a And Not(b)) Or (Not(a) And b)) */
			CHIP Xor {
				IN a, b;
				OUT out;

				PARTS:
				Not (in=a, out=nota);
				Not (in=b, out=notb)
				And (a=a, b=notb, out=aAndNotb);
				And (a=nota, b=b, out=notaAndb);
				Or  (a=aAndNotb, b=notaAndb, out=out);
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			The <var>hdl</var> file is really nothing more than a textual
			description of the gate diagram.

		<h3>Buses</h3>
		<p>
			Computers often require manipulating groups of bits together. For
			example, sending some sequence ${00101011}$ from one area to another
			would be much more efficient if we could send it all together rather
			than sending it one by one.
		</p>
		<p>
			To help achieve this efficiency, we treat a group of bits as a single
			entity called a <b>bus</b>. For example, suppose we want to add two
			${16}$ bit numbers. To do so, we build a gate called a
			<b>${16}$-bit adder</b>. Such a gate requires two inputs that feed
			${16}$ bits each, and output ${16}$ bits. Thus, the gate has ${32}$
			wires feeding into it as input, and ${16}$ wires leaving it as
			output:

		<p>
			Instead of thinking about all of these wires individually, we
			abstract each group of ${16}$ wires as a <i>bus</i>, corresponding to
			groups of ${16}$ bits:

				The multiplexor takes three inputs: The usual <var>a</var> and

				messages as a single stream of bits &mdash; far more cost-efficient

	<h2>The ALU</h2>
	<p>
		The <b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</b> can be thought of as the
		computer's brain. Using the elementary logic gates, we can implement
		<b>adders</b> &mdash; chips designed to add numbers. Once we can
		perform addition, a whole host of other operations are available
		&mdash; subtraction, numeric comparison, and other logical operations.
		The ALU is essentially a packaging of all these new, complex
		operations. And once we have an ALU, we can begin building a
		<i>CPU</i>. Before we begin implementing these adders, however, we must
		review binary arithmetic.

		<h3>Bitstreams & Words</h3>
		<p>
			Suppose we have boxes that can only be filled with either a single
			<var>0</var> or a single <var>1</var>. The boxes are arranged
			linearly to form a package, and packages are unique depending on how
			the boxes are arranged. With just ${1}$ box, how many possible
			packages are there? From combinatorics, we have two possible
			packages:
		</p>
		<div class="horizon">
			<div id="array_of_1"></div>
			<div id="array_of_0"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now suppose we had two boxes. If we had two boxes, then we have four
			possible packages:
		</p>
		<div class="horizon">
			<div id="array_of_4_1"></div>
			<div id="array_of_4_2"></div>
			<div id="array_of_4_3"></div>
			<div id="array_of_4_4"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			And if we had three boxes, we would have eight possible packages:
		</p>
		<div class="horizon">
			<div id="array_of_8_1"></div>
			<div id="array_of_8_2"></div>
			<div id="array_of_8_3"></div>

			<div id="array_of_8_7"></div>
			<div id="array_of_8_8"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
			In general, if we have ${n}$ bits, where ${n}$ is a positive integer,
			we have ${2^n}$ possible packages. This analysis extends to
			computation. For computers, the boxes are <b>bits</b>, and the
			packages are <b>bitstreams</b> (sequences of bits):

			Look at the binary number representations. Those are really just
			bitstreams. More importantly, at each power of ${2,}$ we need an
			additional bit. This demonstrates that with ${k}$ bits, the largest
			decimal number we can represent is ${2^k-1}$ (minus ${1}$ because we
			must represent ${0}$; i.e., the count starts from ${0}$). For
			example, with just ${1}$ bit, the biggest number we can represent is
			${2^1 - 1 = 1.}$ With ${2}$ bits, the biggest number we can represent
			is ${2^2 - 1 = 3.}$ With ${8}$ bits, the biggest number we can
			represent is ${2^8 - 1 = 255.}$ And with ${32}$ bits, the biggest
			number we can represent is ${2^{32} - 1 = 4~294~967~295.}$<sup></sup>
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Note that these numbers change if we're representing negative
				numbers. For example, suppose we wanted to represent both positive
				numbers and their negative counterparts. How we represent the
				negative numbers (to be covered shortly) impacts the range of
				decimal numbers we can represent. For example, if we used the
				<i>signed-magnitude approach</i>, we use the first bit to indicate
				the signum &mdash; <var>1</var> for negative, and <var>0</var> for
				positive. This leaves us with just ${7}$ bits for the actual
				numbers. And with just ${7}$ bits, the largest decimal we can
				represent is ${2^7 - 1 = 127.}$ Thus, the largest number we can
				represent is ${127,}$ and the smallest number we can represent is
				${-127.}$ ${127}$ bitstreams are used to represent the negative
				numbers, ${127}$ bitstreams for the positive numbers, and ${2}$
				bitstreams for zero (<var>00000000</var> and <var>10000000</var>).
				This exhausts all of the possible bit streams: ${127+127+2=256.}$
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			For simple computers, only so many numbers can be represented &mdash;
			there's a ceiling on how many bits are used to make a bitstream. In
			other words, returning to our box-package analogy, there's a limit on
			how many boxes the computer can fit into a single package. That limit
			is called a <b>word size</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, for computers with a word size of ${8}$ bits, there are
			${256}$ possible bitstreams, or ${256}$ possible words. For computers
			with a word size of ${32}$ bits, there are a little over ${4}$
			billion possible words.

	<section id="binary_arithmetic">
		<h3>Binary Arithmetic</h3>
		<p>
			Because binary numbers are just representations of numbers, we can
			perform addition over binary numbers. Later, when we consider how to
			represent negative numbers, subtraction and numeric comparisons
			(i.e., <var>&lt;</var>, <var>&gt;</var>, <var>&geq;</var>,
			<var>&leq;</var>, and <var>=</var>) are trivial. More complex
			operations like multiplication and division, however, are implemented
			with higher level software rather than the ALU.
		</p>
		<p>
			Binary addition is fairly straightforward. We just add the ones and
			zeros:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} &0~0~1 \\ +~&0~1~0 \\ \hline &0~1~1 \end{aligned}
			$$
		</figure>
		<p>If we converted the numbers to decimal, we get:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} &1 \\ +~&2 \\ \hline &3 \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Easy enough. But what happens when we get ${11_{[2]}+11_{[2]}?}$
			Well, we can think about a simpler problem, ${1_{[2]}+1_{[2]}.}$ In
			terms of decimal numbers, ${1_{[10]} + 1_{[10]} = 2_{[10]}.}$ We know
			that ${2}$ in binary is ${10_{[2]}.}$ Thus, ${1_{[2]} + 1_{[2]} =
			10_{[2]}.}$ This means that when we perform binary addition, the
			addition ${1_{[2]} + 1_{[2]}}$ results in a
			<b>carry bit</b> of ${1_{[2]}.}$ Accordingly, we have the following
			carry over combinations:
		</p>
		<div class="horizon">
			$$ \begin{aligned} 1~\phantom{1} & \\ 0~1& \\ +~~~0~1& \\ \hline 1~0&
			\end{aligned} $$ $$ \begin{aligned} 1~\phantom{1} & \\ 1~1& \\
			+~~~0~1& \\ \hline 1~0~0& \end{aligned} $$ $$ \begin{aligned}
			1~\phantom{1} & \\ 1~1& \\ +~~~1~1& \\ \hline 1~1~0& \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
		<p>
			For example, suppose we want to compute ${1101_{[2]} + 0111_{[2]}}$
			(in decimal, ${13 + 7}$). We have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned}
			\color{purple}{1}~\color{green}{1}~\color{blue}{1}~\color{firebrick}{1}~\phantom{1}&
			\\ 1~1~0~1& \\ +~~~0~1~1~1& \\ \hline
			1~\color{purple}{0}~\color{green}{1}~\color{blue}{0}~\color{firebrick}{0}&
			\end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			We can see that this is correct, given that ${10100_{[2]}}$ is ${20}$
			in decimal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Considering the output above, suppose our computer's word size is
			${4.}$ If the word size is ${4,}$ then the computation of
			${1101_{[2]} + 0111_{[2]}}$ results in a number whose binary
			representation exceeds the word size:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 1~1~0~1& \\ +~~~0~1~1~1& \\ \hline
			{\color{indianred}1}~0~1~0~0& \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			When a computation results in a word that exceeds the computer's word
			size, we have an <b>overflow</b>. What happens when an overflow
			occurs? For most ALUs, nothing. The carry bit that does not fit into
			the word is simply ignored, and we end up with:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 1~1~0~1& \\ +~~~0~1~1~1& \\ \hline 0~1~0~0&
			\end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Thus, for the computer with a word size of ${4,}$ computing ${13 +
			7}$ results in ${4.}$ This illustrates a critical point about
			computers: The addition performed is not real integer addition. There
			are infinitely many integers, but computers can only handle a subset
			&mdash; the integers whose binary representations can fit within its
			word size. More formally, computer addition is actually
			<b>${\bmod~2^{\omega}}$ addition</b>, where ${\omega}$ is the word
			size. Thus, for the computer with a word size of ${4,}$ we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 13~+_{2^4}~7 &= 13~+_{16}~7 \\ &= \text{rem}(13+7,
			16) \\ &= \text{rem}(20, 16) \\ &= 4 \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Note that we get this result because we're only representing positive
			integers. When we discuss negative integer representation, we'll see
			how an overflow leads to some interesting, albeit similar, results.

	<section id="adders">
		<h3>Adders</h3>
		<p>
			Now that we understand binary arithmetic, we can now discuss
			<b>adders</b> &mdash; logic gates for performing addition. As we saw
			earlier, when we perform binary addition, there are really just two
			cases we have to consider: Adding two bits (no carryover occurs) and
			adding three bits (a carryover occurs). Accordingly, to implement an
			adder, we need two simpler adders:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The <b>half-adder</b> &mdash; a logic gate that adds two bits.
			</li>
			<li>
				The <b>full-adder</b> &mdash; a logic gate that adds three bits.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Once we have these two simpler adders, we can implement a
			<b>multibit-adder</b> &mdash; a logic gate that adds two
			<i>numbers</i>.
		</p>
		<section id="half_adder">
			<h4>Half-adder</h4>
			<p>
				The <i>half adder</i> has one, and only one, job: Adding two bits.
				Suppose the bits are called <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>. Because
				we have two bits, there are ${2^2 = 4}$ permutations for
				<var>a</var> and <var>b</var>:
			</p>
			<div id="half_adder_a_and_b"></div>
			<p>If we compute the sum for each of the rows:</p>
			<div id="half_adder_a_and_b_sum"></div>
			<p>
				Notice that the last row results in the sum <var>10</var>. Because
				a bit can only be either <var>0</var> or <var>1</var>, we need a an
				additional column &mdash; a second output &mdash; indicating the
				carry bit, if any:
			</p>
			<div id="half_adder_a_and_b_sum_carry"></div>
			<p>
				Do we notice a pattern in this truth table? Well, for starters, we
				see that the <var>sum</var> column's values are really the result
				of ${a ⊻ b.}$ In other words, <var>XOR(a, b)</var>. And the
				<var>carry</var> column's values are the result of ${a ∧ b,}$ or
				<var>AND(a,b)</var>.
			</p>
			<p>Thus, we have the HDL implementation:</p>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				CHIP HalfAdder {
					IN a, b;
					OUT sum, carry;

					PARTS:
						Xor(a=a, b=b, out=sum);
						And(a=a, b=b, out=carry);
				}
			</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="full_adder">
			<h4>Full-adder</h4>
			<p>
				Now that we have a half-adder, let's consider the full-adder. The
				full-adder's purpose is to add three bits. Let's say those bits are
				called <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and <var>c</var>. Just as we saw
				with the half adder, the full-adder has two outputs: a
				<var>sum</var> and a <var>carry</var>. With three bits, we have
				${2^3 = 8}$ permutations. Laid out as a truth table:
			</p>
			<div id="full_adder_truth_table"></div>
			<p>
				While it may seem difficult to determine how we would implement the
				full-adder, it's helpful to start by just considering
				<var>a</var> and <var>b</var> first. If we add these two bits
				together, there's a carry bit and a sum bit. The sum bit from
				adding <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> must then be added to
				<var>c</var>. The result is the final sum, and a final carry. The
				final sum is straightforward &mdash; we pass <var>a</var> and
				<var>b</var> to a half adder, and pass its sum and
				<var>c</var> into another half adder.
			</p>
			<div class="horizon">
				<div id="half_adder_a_and_b_sum_carry_sum1"></div>
				<div id="full_adder_truth_table_expanded"></div>
			</div>
			<p>
				But what about the final carry? Well, if we think a little more
				carefully about adding three bits, we have a carry of
				<var>1</var> if we get a carry from adding <var>a</var> and
				<var>b</var>, <em>or</em> if we get a carry from adding
				<var>sum1</var> and <var>c</var>. Accordingly, we have the
				implementation:
			</p>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				CHIP FullAdder {
					IN a, b, c; 
					OUT sum, carry;
			
					PARTS:
						HalfAdder(a=a, b=b, sum=sum1, carry=carry1);
						HalfAdder(a=c, b=sum1, sum=sum, carry=carry2);
						Or(a=carry1, b=carry2, out=carry);
				}
			</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="multi_bit_adder">
			<h4>Multibit-adder</h4>
			<p>
				Now that we have a full-adder and a half-adder, the multibit-adder
				is almost trivial. Let's say we're working with ${16}$-bit
				integers. This means we want a ${16}$-bit adder &mdash; an adder
				with two ${16}$-bit inputs, and one ${16}$-bit output. If we again
				recall how binary addition works, we add from right to left. The
				right-most column is a simple half-adder, since there is no carry
				bit when we first perform the addition. All other columns must be
				computed with a full-adder.

		<h3>Negative Integers</h3>

			So far, we've only been working with nonnegative integers, ${0, 1, 2,

				With sign bit representation, the first bit is reserved for the
				integer's signum, and the remaining bits represent a nonnegative
				integer. Intuitive as it may be, sign bit representation has
				downsides; so much so that it's the least popular approach for
				representing negatives.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, we have two distinct representations for zero: ${-0}$ and
				${+0.}$ While those coming from languages like JavaScript may be
				comfortable with this notion, it flies in the face of mathematics
				and requires further implementations for handling the two cases of
				zero. This kind of complexity at such a low level is undesirable
				&mdash; it's very, very easy to entangle ourselves in elaborate
				case-handling schemes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, subtraction is not straightforward. From mathematics, we
				know that subtraction is just the addition of a nonnegative and a
				negative. If we tried doing so with sign bit representation, we get
				strange results. For example, suppose we wanted to compute ${5-2.}$
				Using sign bit representation, we have:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 0~1~0~1 & \\ 1~0~1~0 & \\ \hline 1~1~1~1
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				Clearly, this is not the right answer. We expected to get ${3,}$
				but instead we got ${1~1~1~1,}$ which is ${-7.}$ The fact is, the
				binary additional algorithm <em>does not</em> work with sign bit
				representation. Instead, we have to perform a more elaborate
				procedure. First, we determine which of the two numbers is greater.
				In this case, it's ${5.}$ This means that the sign of the sum is
				<var>1</var>. Then, we perform subtraction on the non-sign bits. If
				we encounter ${0-1,}$ we borrow from the leftmost column, and
				compute ${1:}$
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 0~1~\phantom{1}& \\ \cancel{1}~\cancel{0}~1 & \\
				-~~~0~\cancel{1}~0 & \\ \hline 0~1~1 \end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>Then we add the sign for the larger number:</p>
			<figure>$$ 0~0~1~1 $$</figure>
			<p>
				which give us the correct answer, ${3.}$ This is a needlessly
				complicated process requiring an entirely separate logic gate, a
				<b>subtractor</b>, with the following truth table:
			</p>
			<div id="sign_bit_subtractor"></div>
			<p>
				Third, we're reducing the number of bits available for
				representation. With sign bit representation, if we have a word
				size ${\omega,}$ the largest number we can represent is ${2^{\omega
				- 1}-1.}$ For example, consider the table above. Suppose a
				computer's word size is ${4.}$ With sign bit representation, the
				largest number we can represent is ${7.}$ If it weren't for that
				additional representation of ${0,}$ we'd at least have ${8.}$

			<h4>One's Complement Representation</h4>
			<p>
				Another representation approach is <b>one's complement</b>. With
				one's complement, negative numbers are formed by <q>flipping</q> or
				<q>reflecting</q> all of the bits &mdash; turn all the ones into
				zeros, and all the zeros into ones. For example, the binary number
				${1011_{\texttt{b}},}$ flipped, is ${0100_{\texttt{b}}.}$ This
				<q>flipped</q> form of ${1011_{\texttt{b}},}$ the binary number
				${0100_{\texttt{b}},}$ is called the <b>complement</b> of
				${1011_{\texttt{b}},}$ and the operation of reflecting or flipping
				the digits is called <b>complementing</b>. Through complementing,
				the most significant bit communicates the number's sign. Note,
				however, that this is <em>not</em> sign bit.

				Compared to sign bit representation, subtraction in one's
				complement is a little simpler. For example, to compute ${a-b}$ in
				binary, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are positive integers, we perform the
				following procedure:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Compute the one's complement of the ${b.}$ Let ${b_c}$ be the
					result.
				</li>
				<li>Compute ${a + b_c.}$ Let ${S}$ be the result.</li>
				<li>
					If ${a + b_c}$ results in a carry over ${C,}$ drop ${C}$ and add
					${1}$ to the least significant bit of ${S.}$ Else, return ${S.}$
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				For example, suppose we wanted to compute ${7-2.}$ In binary, this
				amounts to computing:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 0~1~1~1 &\\ -~~~0~0~1~0 &\\ \hline \end{aligned}
				$$
			</figure>
			<p>
				We compue the one's complement of ${0010_{\texttt{b}},}$ which is
				${1101_{\texttt{b}},}$ corresponding to ${-2.}$ We then add this
				result to the minuend, ${0111_{\texttt{b}}:}$
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 0~1~1~1 &\\ +~~~1~1~0~1 &\\ \hline 1~0~1~0~0&
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				Notice that this results in an overflow bit. We drop this bit and
				add it to the least significant bit of our result:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 0~1~0~0 &\\
				+~~~\phantom{0}~\phantom{0}~\phantom{0}~1 &\\ \hline 0~1~0~1 &
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				The result is in line with our expected answer, ${5.}$ Undoubtedly,
				one's complement representation leads to an easier implementation
				of subtraction compared to sign bit representation. To find the
				complement of a given word, all we have to do is invert the ones
				and zeros &mdash; passing the bitstream into a NOT-gate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although one's complement provides a simpler way to implement
				subtraction, it still shares problems with sign bit representation.
				We still have two representations for the integer zero: For a 4-bit
				word size computer, ${1111_{\texttt{b}}}$ and
				${0000_{\texttt{b}}.}$
			</p>

		<section id="twos_complement">
			<h4>Two's Complement Representation</h4>
			<p>
				As much as one's complement falls short, its development led to the
				most common form of sign representation &mdash;
				<b>two's complement representation</b>. In two's complement
				representation, we represent signed numbers with two's complements,
				rather than one's complements. What is the two's complement of a
				number? It's just the result of complementing that number and
				adding ${1.}$
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, consider the number ${1}$ in binary. Positive ${1}$ is
				represented as:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ 0~0~0~1_{\texttt{b}} $$</figure>
			<p>
				To find its two's complement, we first compute its one's
				complement:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \texttt{c}~~0~0~0~1 & \\ \hline 1~1~1~0 &
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>Then we add ${1_{\texttt{b}}}$ to the result:</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 1~1~1~0 &\\
				+~~~\phantom{0}~\phantom{0}~\phantom{0}~1 &\\ \hline 1~1~1~1 &
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				The binary number ${1111_{\texttt{b}}}$ corresponds to ${-1.}$ Like
				sign bit representation and one's complement, the most significant
				bit is used to represent the sign.

				To compute ${a + b,}$ we simply use the binary addition algorithm.
				If there's an overflow bit, we discard it. To compute ${a - b,}$ we
				apply the binary algorithm to ${a + b_c,}$ where ${b_c}$ is the
				two's complement of ${b,}$ again discarding an overflow bit, if
				any.
			</p>
			<p>For example, suppose we wanted to compute ${6-5}$ in binary:</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} 0~1~1~0 &\\ +~~~1~0~1~1 &\\ \hline
				{\color{firebrick}1}~0~0~0~1 & \\ \end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				Above, we disregard the overflow bit ${1_{\texttt{b}},}$ leaving us
				with the answer ${0001_{\texttt{b}},}$ which corresponds to the
				decimal ${1,}$ the expected result of ${6-5.}$
			</p>
			<p>
				With two's complement, we're getting a little of the best from
				one's complement and sign bit representation. Addition and
				subtraction are easy to implement. While we don't have as much
				readability as sign bit representation, we're still using the most
				significant bit to represent the number's sign. This isn't a
				particularly large tradeoff, given that most computer users aren't
				directly manipulating bits. But perhaps most importantly, we have
				exactly one representation of zero. At the end of the day, this is
				what we truly wanted. Having just one, unique representation for
				zero greatly simplifies the ALU's implementation.

		<h3>The Arithmetic Logic Unit</h3>
		<p>
			So, we now know how to perform addition and subtraction with logic
			gates. Our next step is examining the
			<b>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</b>. Schematically, the ALU looks
			like:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/ALU_schematic.svg' %}"
				alt="ALU diagram"
				loading="lazy"
				style="width: 350px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The first thing to note is that the ALU is just another chip &mdash;
			it's an abstraction of some process. And just like the chips we've
			seen so far, it has inputs and outputs. Two inputs called
			<var>input1</var> and <var>input2</var>, and a third input denoed
			${f.}$ That third input ${f}$ is <i>function</i>. The ALU takes these
			three inputs, and returns the output
			<var>${f}$(input1, input2)</var>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The function ${f}$ is one out of a set of pre-defined arithmetic and
			logical functions. That set determines what the ALU can and cannot
			do. For most ALUs, the set includes
			<b>arithmetic functions</b> (integer addition, subtraction, and for
			some, multiplication and division), <b>logical functions</b> (AND,
			OR, XOR, NOT, and so on), and even
			<b>bitwise functions</b> (bitwise-AND, bitwise-NOT, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the hardest decisions an ALU designer must make is determining
			which operations the ALU should perform. Making these decisions is
			more economics than it is computer science. Hardware-implemented
			operations are much, much faster than operations implemented via
			software. So in that sense, there's potential for performance gains.
			That, however, can backfire. With more operations, the ALU becomes
			much more complex, and with greater complexity, the more difficult it
			is to debug and maintain the ALU. Moreover, excessive operations can
			lead to <i>slower</i> and more expensive ALUs. Chips are a valuable
			commodity, and at the hardware level, we do not want to waste what
			little real estate we have.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ALU schematic above is a common diagram for denoting the ALU
			among other components. Here's another, more detailed diagram:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/ALU_intro1.svg' %}"
				alt="ALU diagram 2"
				loading="lazy"
				style="width: 350px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Notice how the ALU really is just another chip. We can think of it as
			a bigger, more formidable logic gate. Where the logic gates we've
			been working with can be thought of as small boutique shops, the ALU
			is a massive retail store.
		</p>
		<p>
			Examining the diagram above, we see that the ALU has ${11}$ pins. The
			blue arrows indicate single-bit buses, and the red arrows indicate
			${16}$-bit buses. The single-bit bus inputs, <var>zx</var>,
			<var>nx</var>, <var>zy</var>, <var>ny</var>, <var>f</var>, and
			<var>no</var> all feed either a ${0}$ or ${1}$ into the ALU. These
			inputs are called <b>control bits</b>. Notice that there are ${6}$ of
			these bits. With ${6}$ bits, we have ${2^6 = 64}$ possible
			bitstreams. Those bit streams can then be assigned to particular
			functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Indeed, this is how we <q>pass functions</q> to the ALU. We pass
			specific values for each of the control bits, and the ALU performs
			its operation: Determine which function we're asking for. Here is the
			truth table for just a few of the possible functions:
		</p>
		<div id="ALU_sample_table"></div>
		<p>
			For example, if we send the control bit sequence (called the
			<b>control input</b>):
		</p>
		<div id="control_input_neg"></div>
		<p>
			The ALU computes <var>10 + 3</var>, and outputs <var>13</var>. The
			ALU <q>knows</q> to perform these operations because each of the
			control bits are sent to particular gates. The specifications:
		</p>
		<div class="horizon">
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The zx input:
				if (zx ≡ 1) ⟹ x = 0;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The nx input:
				if (nx ≡ 1) ⟹ x = ¬x;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The zy input:
				if (zy ≡ 1) ⟹ y = 0;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The ny input:
				if (ny ≡ 1) ⟹ y = ¬y;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The f input:
				if (f ≡ 1) ⟹ out = x + y;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The f input:
				if (f ≡ 0) ⟹ out = x & y;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The no input:
				if (no ≡ 1) ⟹ out = ¬out;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The zr output:
				if (out ≡ 0) ⟹ zr = 1;
				else: zr = 0;
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
				// The ng output:
				if (out &lt; 0) ⟹ ng = 1;
				else: ng = 0;
			</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Following these specifications, let's consider an example. Suppose we
			wanted to compute <var>!x</var>. For simplicity, let's just say we're
			using four bits.
		</p>
		<p>
			To compute <var>!x</var>, we must first determine what the control
			input is. In this case, it's the sequence:
		</p>
		<div id="not_sequence"></div>
		<p>
			Suppose our <var>x</var> input is <var>1101</var> and our
			<var>y</var> input is <var>1001</var>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We pass this control input to the ALU, and the respective control bit
			gates execute. First, the gate corresponding to <var>zx</var>. Here,
			its input is <var>0</var>, so we leave <var>x</var> and
			<var>y</var> alone:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			x: 1100
			y: 1011
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Next, the gate corresponding to <var>nx</var>. Here, <var>nx</var> is
			<var>0</var>, so again we leave <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> alone:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			x: 1101
			y: 1011
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Next, <var>zy</var>. Here, we see that <var>ny</var> is <var>1</var>,
			so we zero the <var>y</var> input:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			x: 1100
			y: 0000
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Then we have <var>ny</var>. Again we have <var>ny</var> as
			<var>1</var>. This means we must negate the <var>y</var> input:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			x: 1100
			y: 1111
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Next up, <var>f</var>. If <var>f</var> is <var>1</var>, we compute
			<var>x+y</var>. Here, <var>f</var> is <var>0</var>, so we instead
			compute the bitwise-AND:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			x:   1100
			y:   1111
			out: 1100 
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Finally, we have <var>no</var> set to <var>1</var>. So, we compute
			the bitwise-NOT:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
			x:   1100
			y:   1111
			out: 0011
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Examining the final <var>out</var> value, we see that we get the
			negation of <var>x</var> &mdash; <var>0011</var>.

		<h3>Implementing the ALU</h3>
		<p>
			With a high-level understanding of how the ALU operates, we can now
			examine its implementation. As said earlier, we're only looking at a
			subset of the ALU's possible functions. For an ALU with a control
			input of ${6}$ single-bit buses, we have ${64}$ possible control
			inputs. The schematic below illustrates only ${18}$ of the possible
			control inputs.
		</p>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/ALU_implement.svg' %}"
			alt="Sample implementation"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</section>
	<p>
		Let's break down the implementation in HDL. First, we need the ALU's
		<var>IN</var> and <var>OUT</var> pins:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		CHIP ALU {
			IN
				x[16], y[16],
				zx,
				nx,
				zy,
				ny,
				f,
				no;
			OUT
				out[16]
				zr,
				ng;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now we examine the parts. First, the <var>zx</var> input feeds into a
		gate that zeros the <var>x[16]</var> input if <var>zx</var> is
		<var>1</var>. To implement an if-statement, we need a multiplexor:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		// zx input
		Mux16(a[0..15]=x, b[0..15]=false, sel=zx, out=zxoutputx);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Above, the muliplexor's <var>b</var> input is always <var>0</var>,
		since we're only concerned with the <var>x[16]</var> input. The
		<var>sel</var> input is then used to toggle the multiplexor &mdash; if
		<var>x = 1</var>, then zero <var>x[16]</var>, otherwise, leave
		<var>x[16]</var> alone. We'll call the result <var>zxoutputx</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, the <var>nx</var> control bit. We use this control bit to
		determine if the <var>x</var> input should be negated (bitwise-NOT). To
		do so, we have <var>zxoutputx</var> feed into two inputs &mdash; one
		feeding into a NOT16-gate (whose output is called <var>notx</var>), and
		the other feeding into the <var>a</var> input of MUX16-gate. The
		NOT16-gate's output is then fed into the <var>b</var> input of the
		MUX16-gate. The MUX16-gate has its <var>sel</var> input receive the
		<var>nx</var> control bit, and its output called <var>nxoutputx</var>.
		If <var>nx</var> is <var>1</var>, we output the <var>nxoutputx</var> is
		<var>notx</var>, otherwise is <var>nxoutputx</var>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		// nx input
		Not16(in[0..15]=zxoutputx, out[0..15]=notx);
    Mux16(a[0..15]=zxoutputx, b[0..15]=notx, sel=nx, out[0..15]=nxoutputx);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		After the <var>nx</var> control bit, we have the <var>zy</var> control
		bit. This control bit toggles a gate that zeroes the
		<var>y[16]</var> input. The implementation is the same as the
		<var>zx</var> control, the only difference being we're using
		<var>y[16]</var> as the input and leaving <var>x[16]</var> alone.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		// zy bit
		Mux16(a[0..15]=y, b[0..15]=false, sel=zy, out[0..15]=zyoutputy);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Similar to the <var>nx</var> control's implementation, the
		<var>ny</var> control determines whether to apply the bitwise-NOT to
		the <var>y[16]</var> input.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
    // ny bit
    Not16(in[0..15]=zyoutputy, out[0..15]=noty);
    Mux16(a[0..15]=zyoutputy, b[0..15]=noty, sel=ny, out[0..15]=nyoutputy);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		These implementations take care of the unary operations. The
		<var>f</var> control bit introduces the binary operations. First, if
		the <var>f</var> control bit is <var>1</var>, we compute
		<var>x + y</var>. Otherwise, we compute <var>x & y</var> (bitwise-AND).
		Once again, we're modelling an if-statement, so we need Mux16-gate.
		Because the operations we're implementing take <var>x</var> and
		<var>y</var> as operands, we have to feed the <var>nxoutputx</var> and
		<var>nyoutputy</var> outputs into two gates: a Add16-gate and an
		And16-gate. The Mux16-gate then determines which of the two to output,
		depending on its <var>sel</var> input, the <var>f</var> control bit:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
    // f bit
    Add16(a[0..15]=nxoutputx, b[0..15]=nyoutputy, out[0..15]=xplusy);
    And16(a[0..15]=nxoutputx, b[0..15]=nyoutputy, out[0..15]=xandy);
    Mux16(a[0..15]=xandy, b[0..15]=xplusy, sel=f, out[0..15]=fout);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We'll call the output of the Mux16-gate <var>fout</var>. The last
		control bit is <var>NO</var>. If <var>NO</var> is <var>1</var>, we
		negate <var>fout</var>. Otherwise, we leave <var>fout</var> alone. So,
		we need another Mux16-gate. One of Mux16-gate's inputs receives the
		result of feeding <var>fout</var> into a Not16-gate, the other
		<var>fout</var> directly:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
    // no bit
    Not16(in[0..15]=fout, out[0..15]=notfout);

    // Output 'out'
    Mux16(
        a[0..15]=fout, 
        b[0..15]=notfout, 
        sel=no, 
        out=out
    );
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We've now taken care of all the control bits. All that remains is the
		<var>zr</var> and <var>ng</var> outputs. The <var>zr</var> output
		determines whether the result of the final computation is zero, and the
		<var>ng</var> output determines whether result of final computation is
		negative. Both outputs depend on what <var>out</var> outputs. If
		<var>out</var> is <var>0</var>, then <var>zr</var> outputs
		<var>1.</var> Otherwise, <var>zr</var> outputs <var>0</var>. If
		<var>out</var> is a negative number, then <var>ng</var> outputs
		<var>1</var>. Otherwise, <var>ng</var> outputs
		<var>0.</var>
	</p>
	<p>
		Of these outputs, <var>ng</var> is the easiest. To determine if
		<var>out</var> is negative, we just need the most significant bit of
		<var>out</var>. So, in our final Mux16-gate, we can extract the bit at
		the index <var>15</var> and output that as <var>ng</var>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		// no bit
		Not16(in[0..15]=fout, out[0..15]=notfout);

		Mux16(
			a[0..15]=fout, 
			b[0..15]=notfout, 
			sel=no, 
			out[16]=ng, // 'ng'
			out=out // 'out'
		);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		For the <var>zr</var> output, we must first determine if
		<var>out</var> is zero. Since we're using two's-complement
		representation, the value zero occurs when all of the bits are zero.
		There are many ways to do this. The approach we'll use is to separately
		output two halves of the Mux16-gate's output bits: one called
		<var>lowFinalOut</var>, corresponding to <var>out[0..7]</var>, the
		other called <var>highFinalOut</var>, corresponding to
		<var>out[8..15]</var>. We then feed these inputs into two separate
		Or8Way-gates respectively. Then, we feed the outputs of these two
		Or8Way gates into an OR-gate. The output of the OR-gate, called
		<var>AorBOut</var>, is then fed into a NOT-gate, whose output is
		<var>zr</var>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
    // 'out', 'ng' outputs
    Mux16(
        a[0..15]=fout, 
        b[0..15]=notfout, 
        sel=no, 
        out[0..7]=lowFinalOut,
        out[8..15]=highFinalOut,
        out[15]=ng,
        out=out
    );

    // zr output
    Or8Way(in[0..7]=lowFinalOut, out=lowOut);
    Or8Way(in[0..7]=highFinalOut, out=highOut);
    Or(a=lowout, b=highOut, out=AorBOut);
    Not(in=AorBOut, out=zr);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		To illustrate why this works, suppose the final <var>out</var> is
		<var>1001 0010 0101 1101</var>. It follows that
		<var>lowFinalOut</var> is <var>0101 1101</var>, and
		<var>highFinalOut</var> is <var>1001 0010</var>. Passing these two
		inputs into separate Or8Way-gates, we get <var>1</var> and
		<var>1</var>. Passing <var>1</var> and <var>1</var> into an OR-gate, we
		get <var>1</var>. And passing that into a NOT-gate, we get
		<var>0</var>. This is correct, given that the final <var>out</var>
		<var>1001 0010 0101 1101</var> is not zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alternatively, suppose the final <var>out</var> is
		<var>0000 0000 0000 0000</var>. We thus have <var>0000 0000</var> for
		<var>lowFinalOut</var> and <var>0000 0000</var> for
		<var>highFinalOut</var>. Passing these to two <var>Or8Way</var>'s, we
		get <var>0</var> and <var>0</var>. Passing <var>0</var> and
		<var>0</var> into an OR-gate, we get <var>0</var>. And passing
		<var>1</var> into a NOT-gate, we get <var>1</var>. Again this is
		correct, given that the final <var>out</var>
		<var>0000 0000 0000 0000</var> is zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we can likely tell, an ALU with just ${6}$ control inputs &mdash;
		called a <b>${6}$-bit ALU</b> &mdash; is already fairly complex. Early
		computers had ${4}$- and ${8}$-bit ALUs (thus capable of implementing
		${16}$ operations and ${256}$ hardware-based operations respectively).
		Later, computers progressed to ${32}$-bit ALUs (over ${4}$ billion
		possible operations), and today, ${64}$-bit ALUs (over ${18}$
		quintillion possible operations). Again, just because we have these
		possibilities does not mean designers exhaust all of them. Gates are
		<i>expensive</i>, and it's not at all unreasonable for designers to
		only use some of the possible bitstreams. For example, computers that
		used the Z80 processor in the 1970s could very well have implemented an
		${8}$-bit ALU, since the Z80 had a word size of ${8}$ bits.
		Nevertheless, the designers stuck with just ${4}$ control bits, saving
		power and transistor costs.

<section id="time">
	<h2>Implementing Time</h2>
	<p>
		The gates we've implemented so far all execute instantenously. We can
		perform Boolean and arithmetic operations, but the operations occur all
		at once. This is because our implementations have been pure
		applications of <b>combinatorial logic</b> &mdash; the logical analysis
		of <i>fixed</i> propositions, or propositions whose truth values are
		predetermined. Computers, however, operate on
		<b>sequential logic</b> &mdash; the logical analysis of
		<i>variable</i> propositions, or propositions whose truth values are
		not predetermined. The key difference between these two forms of logic:
		Combinatorial logic does not account for time, or change, but
		sequential logic does. With sequential logic, we're concerned with what
		happend <q>previously</q>. For computers, the ability to
		<q>remember</q> &mdash; <i>memory</i> &mdash; is everything. It's what
		gives the digital calculator an upperhand over an abacus.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once we implement a way for our machine to recall, or remember, we
		suddenly have several features:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Hardware components can be reused.</li>
		<li>
			State can be saved. This allows us to perform <i>loops</i> &mdash;
			repeating computations.
		</li>
		<li>Imposing speed limits.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The final feature may seem odd, but it's crucial that computers do not
		perform computations faster than it can.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the real world, <i>time</i> is a continuous scalar &mdash; a line
		with infinitely many points. Computers, however, are finite things, so
		they can only understand discrete values. Thus, we need a way to
		represent time for a computer. To do so, we divide time into discrete,
		equal-sized blocks.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/computer_time.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 350px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In computer terms, the length of each block is called a
		<b>cycle</b> &mdash; the computer's unit of time. Question: How do we
		divide time with a computer? With a device called a <b>clock</b>, or
		more generally, an electronic oscillator. The clock is a circuit that
		takes direct current (DC), and converts it into alternating current
		(AC) &mdash; <var>0</var> and <var>1</var>. This results in square
		waves, and each period of the square wave &mdash; the time between
		going from <var>1</var> (called a <i>tick</i>) to <var>0</var> (called
		a <i>tock</i>) and back to <var>1</var> &mdash; is the length of a
		block, or a cycle.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/computer_time_square_wave.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 350px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With this clock, we can assign each block a unique integer. The first
		block is <var>t=1</var>, the second block is <var>t=2</var>, the third
		block is <var>t=3</var>, and so on. And within each of these blocks, we
		can execute some operation with the gates we implemented. For example,
		maybe at <var>t=1</var> a logical <var>AND</var> is performed, then at
		<var>t=2</var> a logical <var>NOT</var> is performed, then an
		<var>ADD16</var>, etc:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sequential_functions.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 500px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice what we've accomplished &mdash; sequential operations; perform
		an <var>AND()</var>, then a <var>NOT()</var>, then an
		<var>ADD16()</var>. Let's iron out some of the details.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first problem with our approach is that the clock takes time to go
		from <var>0</var> to <var>1</var> (called the <b>rise time</b>) and
		from <var>1</var> to <var>0</var> (called the <b>fall time</b>). These
		are delays.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/jitter.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 500px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The fact is, signals never make instantaneous transitions from
		<var>0</var> to <var>1</var>. This extends to the logic gates
		themselves &mdash; it takes time for charges to build up and dissipate.
		This delay, called <b>propogation delay</b>, slows down the speed at
		which bits travel from one gate to another.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fortunately, there's a fix: Just make the blocks shorter. In other
		words, instead of defining the cycle as strictly the time it takes to
		go from <var>0</var> to <var>1</var>, we define the cycle as something
		shorter than that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/true_cycle.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 500px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		By defining the blocks in this way, we leave some time to account for
		delays; i.e., allowing the system to stabilize. In doing so, we do not
		have to concern ourselves with the complexities of delay handling.
	</p>
	<p>
		With this notion of time, sequential logic is now more apparent. To
		repeat, with combinatorial logic, we were effectively computing:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{out}(t) = f(\texttt{in}(t)) $$</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, the output of some Boolean function ${f}$ at time ${t}$
		is the the result of operating on an input fed to the function at time
		${t.}$ This is instantaneous:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/combinatorial_logic.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>With sequential logic, we can now perform the following:</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{out}(t) = f(\texttt{in}(t-1)) $$</figure>
	<p>
		I.e., the output of some Boolean function ${f}$ at time ${t}$ is the
		result of operating on an input fed to the function at time ${t-1.}$
		I.e., whatever input was fed in the previous cycle:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sequential_logic.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because of this ability to use the output of the previous cycle, we do
		not necessarily have to output different bit, or bitstream, at each
		cycle. Instead, we can pass a single bit or bitstream through all of
		the wires, modifying that bit or bitstream as it passes through the
		gates:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/state_sequential.svg' %}"
			alt="computer time divide"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 400px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This evidences a key point in computing: Sequential logic is what
		introduces the notion of bits, or more broadly, objects, having a
		<i>state</i>. And because states exist, we can perform state-dependent
		computations:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{state}(t) = f(\texttt{state(t-1)}) $$</figure>
	<p>
		Indeed, it is precisely because sequential logic that we have a common
		dividing factor among programming languages &mdash; mutability (using a
		single object and changing its state) versus non-mutability (producing
		new objects and recalling as needed).
	</p>

<section id="memory">
	<h2>Primitive Memory</h2>
	<p>
		So, we know that operations can be performed strictly within certain
		blocks of time. The question then, is, how do we move information from
		one block to another? In other words, let's say the block is ${t,}$ and
		the block before it is ${t-1.}$ How do we move information from ${t-1}$
		to ${t?}$ Through a special chip called a <i>flip-flop</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To understand how the flip-flop works, it's helpful to consider its
		cousin, the <b>SR latch (Set-resest latch)</b>. The SR latch is a chip
		with two outputs, <var>Q</var> and ${\overline{\texttt{Q}}.}$ The
		values of these two ouputs depends on its two inputs,
		<var>set</var> and <var>reset</var>.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/SR_latch.svg' %}"
			alt="flip flop"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		There are two types of latches: (1) the
		<b>active-high SR latch (HSRLatch)</b> and (2) the
		<b>active-low SR latch (LSRLatch)</b>. For the HSRLatch, we have the
		following truth table:
	</p>
	<div id="hsr_latch"></div>
	<p>
		We can obtain this truth table by <i>cross-coupling</i> two nor-gates:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/hsrLatch.svg' %}"
			alt="lsr latch"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 190px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the truth table above, <var>NC</var> indicates <i>no-change</i>,
		meaning that the the outputs of <var>Q</var> and
		${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$ remain in their present state &mdash; either
		<var>(Q=0, ${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$=0)</var>,
		<var>(Q=0, ${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$=1)</var>, or
		<var>(Q=1, ${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$=0)</var>. Notice that from the
		truth table, we see the HSRLatch's mechanism. If <var>set=1</var>, then
		<var>Q=1</var>. <var>Q</var> stays as <var>1</var> until
		<var>reset=1</var>. Only when <var>reset=1</var> and
		<var>set=1</var> does <var>Q</var> go back to <var>0</var>, and
		<var>${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$=1</var>. Contrast this with the
		LSRLatch's truth table:
	</p>
	<div id="lsr_latch"></div>
	<p>The LSRLatch is implemented by cross-coupling two nand-gates:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/lsrLatch.svg' %}"
			alt="lsr latch"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 190px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Compared to the HSRLatch, the <var>set</var> and
		<var>reset</var> inputs for the LSRLatch are always set to
		<var>1</var>. When <var>set=0</var>, the
		<var>${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$</var> output sends <var>1</var>. It
		stays at <var>1</var> until <var>set=0</var> and <var>reset=1</var>.
		And when both <var>set=0</var> and <var>reset=0</var>, the two outputs
		go back to <var>1</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In both of the truth tables, <var>NC</var>, which indicates no-change.
		If we think about this a little more carefully, we can see that this is
		effectively a way of <i>persisting</i> data &mdash; <var>Q</var> and
		<var>${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$</var> do not change until either the
		<var>set</var> or <var>reset</var> inputs change. Thus, we now have a
		way of saving, or remembering, data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first obvious problem with the SR latch is the fact that we can
		accidentally change <var>set</var> and <var>reset</var>, thereby losing
		the current state. The fact is, the SR latches are fragile chips. It's
		too easy to lose the current state.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second problem is indicated by the <var>⊥</var> symbols (the
		logical symbol for a contradiction) in the truth tables. These are
		considered <i>indeterminate states</i> &mdash; for those particular
		values of <var>set</var> and <var>reset</var>, the ouputs
		<var>Q</var> and <var>${\overline{\texttt{Q}}}$</var> could be
		anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of these two problems, SR latches are not commonly used
		directly. Instead, they're more of a component for a more common chip
		&mdash; the <b>flip flop</b>. The flip flop is a essentially a latch
		without the risk of accidentally changing the <var>set</var> and
		<var>reset</var> inputs (i.e., a solution to the first problem). To
		prevent accidental setting or resetting, we need two more nand-gates,
		and an <var>enable</var> pin:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/flipflop.svg' %}"
			alt="flip flop"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 300px"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		By using two additional nand-gates and an <var>enable</var> pin, we can
		no longer accidentally set or reset the SR latch. If the
		<var>enable</var> pin is fed the <var>clock</var>'s output (inputs
		oscillating between <var>0</var> and <var>1</var>), we get the
		following truth table:
	</p>
	<div id="flip_flop_truth_table"></div>
	<p>
		Notice that when the
		<var>clock</var> feeds <var>0</var>, no change occurs &mdash; the
		current state persists. Only when the <var>clock</var> feeds
		<var>1</var> do we have the opportunity to change the current state.
		Because of this characteristic, we can write a more expressive truth
		table:
	</p>
	<div id="flip_flop_truth_table_2"></div>
	<p>
		In the table above, ${\texttt{T}_{n}}$ corresponds to the current state
		of the SR latch's output (the output <var>Q</var>), and
		${\texttt{T}_{n-1}}$ corresponds to the previous state of the SR
		latch's output. We still, however, have the problem of an indeterminate
		state &mdash; the situation where <var>clock=1</var>, <var>s=1</var>,
		and <var>r=1</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
		How might we get around this problem? Well, let's look at the truth
		table. The indeterminate state occurs when <var>set=1</var> and
		<var>reset=1</var>. More generally, we only enter the indeterminate
		state when <var>set</var> and <var>reset</var> are the same.
		Accordingly, we can get around this problem by: (1) instead of inputs
		directly into the <var>set</var> and <var>reset</var> pins, we instead
		pass a single input to a pin called <var>in</var>, (2) the input fed
		into <var>in</var> goes in two directions: (a) to the
		<var>set</var> pin, and (b) to a NOT-gate. The output of the NOT-gate
		is then fed into the <var>reset</var> pin:
	</p>

			alt="A dflip-flop gate"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 400px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Using this approach, we never reach a point where <var>set</var> and
		<var>reset</var> are the same. Thus, our truth table now looks like:
	</p>
	<div id="dflipflop_truth_table"></div>
	<p>
		This particular gate is called a <b>data flip flop)</b> or
		<b>D flip flop</b> (abbrevated <b>DFF</b>). Because the D flip-flop is
		the most basic component for implementing memory, it's generally
		encapsulated as a single chip with the following diagram:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/flip-flop_gate.svg' %}"
			alt="flip flop"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the diagram, the small triangle corresponds to the
		<var>clock</var> input. Because of this encapsulation, we have the
		following truth table for the D flip-flop:
	</p>
	<div id="dflipflop_final_truth_table"></div>
	<p>
		In the table above, we see that we still have the ability to persist
		state. We lose the previous state only if the clock is <var>1</var> and
		we change the input for <var>in</var>. If we keep <var>in</var> at
		<var>0</var>, then the <var>out</var> remains <var>0</var>. Only when
		we we change <var>out</var> to <var>1</var> and the clock is
		<var>1</var> does the state change to <var>1</var>. Accordingly, this
		truth table can be thought of as:
	</p>
	<div id="dflipflop_simplified"></div>
	<p>Viewed in this way, we see that:</p>
	<figure>$$ \large \texttt{out(T)} = \texttt{in(T-1)} $$</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, the output of the D flip-flop is whatever the previous
		input was. That's memory. But, as hinted at by this section's title,
		it's <i>primitive</i>. We can only remember what the
		<i>previous input</i> was. This is useful, but it also means that once
		we change inputs, the previous output is lost. And for many
		applications, we <i>want</i> to recall the previous output:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \large \texttt{out(T)} = \texttt{out(T-1)} $$</figure>
	<p>
		This is, in fact, what classical computer storage is. To implement this
		behavior, we need a special chip called a <i>register</i>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="registers">
	<h2>Registers</h2>
	<p>
		If we examine the D flip-flop closely, it's apparent that the chip
		does, in fact, output <var>out(T-1)</var>. That's just the current
		<var>out</var> viewed by the next <var>out</var>. This means that, to
		get <var>out = out(T-1)</var>, we just need a way to toggle the D
		flip-flop's output. If it's <var>1</var>, return <var>in(T-1)</var>,
		and if it's <var>0</var>, return <var>out(T-1)</var>. Now, how do
		implement if-then with the gates we have so far? With a multiplexor:

	<p>
		In the schematic above, we have a Mux-gate feeding into a DFF. The
		Mux-gate then has a <var>sel</var> input called <var>load</var>, and
		two inputs &mdash; whatever we pass as <var>in</var> currently, and
		<var>out</var>, whatever the DFF is outputting currently. If the
		<var>load</var> bit is <var>1</var>, then the output is whatever the
		last input was. If the <var>load</var> bit is <var>0</var>, then the
		output is whatever the last output was. In HDL:

	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>

			PARTS:
			DFF(in=muxOut, out=out, out=dffOut);
			Mux(a=dffOut, b=in, sel=load, out=muxOut);
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This chip is called a <b>${1}$-bit register</b>, or a
		<b>binary cell</b>, and we encapsulate it as such:

		This is a big, big breakthrough. Why? Because we can line ${8}$ of them
		up into an array, using a single multiplexor to provide the load bit:

		The result: A <b>multibit register</b>. More specifically, the register
		above is an ${8}$-bit register, reminiscent of early computers. Today,
		we have ${16,}$ ${32,}$ ${64,}$ and even ${128}$-bit registers. The
		number of binary cells used to construct a single register &mdash; be
		it ${4}$ or ${128}$ &mdash; is called the register's <b>width</b>. At
		any given moment, these registers store some piece of data &mdash; what
		we know as <b>words</b>.

<section id="computer_memory">
	<h2>Computer Memory</h2>
	<p>
		In computer science, the word <q>memory</q> is a general term, or
		abstraction, for any device or system that provides a means to persist
		data across time. Hence, the term is somewhat ambiguous, because there
		are numerous examples of such devices. This is evidenced by the fact
		that laypersons, upon hearing the word <q>memory,</q> often think of
		the ${1}$TB or ${512}$TB hard drive mentioned in laptop ads. But when
		placed in a computer science lecture, they might be confused by the
		speaker talking about memory in terms of something smaller than the
		hard drive they thought of &mdash; ${8}$GB, ${16}$GB, ${32}$GB, or more
		recently, ${64}$GB. This confusion results from the fact that the
		speaker and the layperson are thinking of two different <i>forms</i> of
		memory. The speaker is thinking about <i>main memory</i>, and the
		layperson is thinking about <i>secondary memory</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The registers we saw in the previous section constitute the computer's
		<b>main memory</b>. Main memory itself consists of two types:
		<b>Random Access Memory (RAM)</b> and <b>Read-only Memory (ROM)</b>.
		RAM is the memory we'll address first in the next section, and it's
		what we have so far with the registers we've made.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the registers we've made, we can see that there are two states:
		(1) save, or (2) change. ROM is memory without the second state; we can
		<i>read</i> the data saved, but we cannot <i>write</i> (i.e., change)
		it. We will examine ROM in more detail later. Both RAM and ROM comprise
		the computer's main memory.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike main memory, <b>secondary memory</b> is memory
		<i>outside</i> the computer's motherboard. Thus, secondary memory is
		more akin to a <i>peripheral</i> like a keyboard, mouse, or monitor.
		Secondary memory is what many laypersons think of when they hear the
		word <q>memory</q> in the computer context. It includes devices like
		hard disk drives (HDD) and solid state drives (SSDs). However, it also
		includes devices and systems that don't immediately spring to mind:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<i>Punch cards.</i> The earliest computers were gargantuan machines
			that were really just powerful calculators, with instructions fed via
			punch cards.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Magnetic tape.</i> Think casettes and VHS tapes. This also
			includes floppy disks, which, while now more commonly relegated to
			the <i>save</i> icon, are still in use by Boeing 747's and the U.S.
			nuclear weapons forces.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Magnetic core.</i> The predominant form of RAM from 1955 to 1975,
			magnetic core is the precursor for the modern <i>flash memory</i>, a
			kind of secondary memory. Flash memory includes devices like SD
			cards, USB thumb drives, microSDs, and solid-state drives.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Magnetic drums.</i> Modern hard disk drives, like the large HDD's
			built into laptops trace their roots to magnetic drums, one of the
			earliest forms of secondary memory.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Cloud storage.</i> Given how secondary memory is used, modern
			cloud storage is arguably secondary memory. Examples include Amazon's
			<i>AWS</i>, <i>Microsoft Azure</i>, <i>Google Cloud</i>,
			<i>Dropbox</i>, <i>Box</i>, and many more.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		All memory, main or secondary, can be classified as one of two types:
		<b>volatile</b> and <b>non-volatile</b>. With everything we know so
		far, it's clear that everything we've built only works if our machine
		has access to electricity. The distinction between volatile and
		non-volatile memory boils down to how they answer the following
		question: What happens to the saved data when the elecricity's cut off?
		For volatile memory, it's all lost. Accordingly, because of the way RAM
		is implemented (as we'll see in the next section), RAM is considered
		volatile memory. For non-volatile memory, nothing &mdash; the last
		saved data persists even when the electricity's cut off. Examples of
		non-volatile memory include ROM and most forms of secondary memory.
	</p>

<section id="ram">
	<h2>RAM</h2>
	<p>
		RAM is a chip the computer uses to store a program's instructions, and
		the data those instructions operate on. This is a very high-level
		overview. To understand what this means, let's see how the RAM is
		built. To do so, let's review how registers work.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we saw earlier, we can arrange ${w}$ binary cells to form an
		${w}$-bit register. Knowing that, we can now forget about the
		register's implementation details and just think of it as a single
		chip:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/multibit_register.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 350px"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		In the diagram above, the register consumes its inputs with a ${w}$-bit
		bus, and produces with a ${w}$-bit bus of outputs. The register has a
		<b>width</b>, ${w,}$ which is the number of binary cells comprising the
		register. As we'll see in later sections, because we never actually
		work with bitstreams directly when we're programming in a high-level
		language (at that level of abstraction, we're working with registers
		indirectly), the register's width is also called the <b>word size</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alongside the word size, the register also has a <b>state</b> &mdash;
		the current sequence of outputs in each of the register's ${w}$ binary
		cells. Because those outputs can be given meaning, the register's state
		can also be defined as the current <i>value</i> being expressed by the
		register. Or even more abstractly, the current <i>data</i> stored in
		the register.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we saw with the register's implementation, with the use of a
		<var>load</var> bit, there are two actions we can perform: (1) access,
		or in computer science terms, <b>read</b>, the data currently stored in
		the register, or (2) change, or <b>write</b>, the data inside the
		register. To read the register, we simply set the <var>load</var> bit
		to <var>0</var>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		// Read the register
		set out = 0;
	</code></pre>
	<p>To write the register:</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		// Write the register
		set in   = v;
		set load = 1;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		where <var>v</var> is the new value we want the register to store. So
		we have a single register. Implementing a ${16}$-bit register in HDL is
		just a matter of wiring together ${16}$ binary cells:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		module Register (in[16], load, out[16]);

			input in[16], load;
			output out[16];
		
			PARTS:

				Bit(in=in[1],  load=load,  out=out[1]);
				Bit(in=in[2],  load=load,  out=out[2]);
				Bit(in=in[3],  load=load,  out=out[3]);

	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Where does the RAM come in? Well, RAM is just a chip that encapsulates
		a <i>stack</i> of these registers:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/ram_registers.svg' %}"
			alt="ram registers"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 600px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the schematic above, we see that the RAM consists of a stack of
		registers. If there are ${n}$ registers, we say that the RAM
		constitutes ${n}$-register memory, or, in short, RAM${n.}$ Thus, for an
		${8}$ register RAM, we have RAM8, and for a ${64}$ register RAM, we
		have RAM64.
	</p>
	<p>
		The RAM has ${5}$ pins: four pins for inputs, and one pin for output.
		The four pins:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>An <var>in</var> pin to feed new data into some register.</li>
		<li>
			A <var>load</var> pin to toggle between reading and writing some
			register.
		</li>
		<li>A <var>clock</var> pin to feed the clock's output.</li>
		<li>And an <var>address</var> pin to feed an address.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Wait. What address? Well, since the registers are stacked, they
		inherently have order. The topmost register can be interpreted as the
		first register, and the bottommost register can be interpreted as the
		last register. And because they have an inherent order, each register
		has a <i>unique</i> place among the other registers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, by address, we mean a particular bitstream that, when passed to
		some computation, produces a partricular register's place in the stack.
		This is demonstrated by the diagram: Notice that all of the inputs are
		fed into a dashed box labeled <i>direct access logic</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This box represents the RAM's separate internal logic. It's not really
		a chip (hence the dashed box); it's the algorithm underlying the RAM's
		mechanism. So what does this direct access logic do? It takes the
		address passed and determines which register we're referring to. Once
		it makes that determination, it either reads or writes the data inside
		that particular register, depending on the <var>load</var> bit. If the
		<var>load</var> bit is <var>0</var>, it sends the bits passed to
		<var>in</var> to the correct register. And if we want to read a
		particular register's data, we simply pass that register's address to
		the RAM. The RAM identifies the address, and its <var>out</var> becomes
		the final <var>out</var>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		/* 
		*
		* Let: 
		*   S ≔ state of the selected register
		*   α ≔ unique some address
		*   𝑣 ≔ some value
		*
		*/

		// To read:
		set(address) = α
		set(in)      = 𝑣

		// To write:
		set(address) = α
		set(in)      = 𝑣
		set(load)    = 1

		if load ≡ 1 then {
			S   = in
			out = S      // from the next cycle onward
		}
		else out = S
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Again, registers do not have hardcoded addresses. It's pure logic. We
		think of them as having addresses because once we take a step back and
		abstract away the implementation details, they truly seem to have
		addresses. So what do these addresses look like? They're just unique
		bitstreams. For example, suppose we have a RAM8. This RAM consists of
		${8}$ registers. To give them unique addresses, we just need ${3}$
		bits, since ${3}$ bits produces eight unique bitstreams:
	</p>
	<div id="ram8"></div>
	<p>
		With RAM4, that's four registers, so we need ${2}$ bits, since ${2^2 =
		4.}$ Based on this analysis, we have the following proposition:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Definition: Minimum Address Width</small>
		<p>
			Given a RAM${n,}$ where ${n}$ is the number of registers in the RAM,
			the number of ${k}$ bits needed to assign unique addresses to each
			register is:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ k = \log_{2}n $$</figure>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		In the diagram above, we indicate this proposition by denoting the
		<var>address</var> input as a bus of ${k}$ width.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before doing so, we should state some implications of this design
		approach:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Given a sequence of ${n}$ addressable registers, the addresses are
			${0}$ to ${n-1.}$
		</li>
		<li>
			At any given point in time, only <em>one</em> register in the RAM is
			selected.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		So what does the implementation look like? It turns out that all we
		need is an ${8}$-way demultiplexor and an ${8}$-way demultiplexor:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/ram_detail.svg' %}"
			alt="RAM implementation"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Recall that with an ${n}$-way demultiplexor, we feed some input into
		the multiplexor, and depending on the sequence of <var>sel</var> lines,
		it selects one, and only one, of its ${n}$ output pins to output from.
		The same goes for the ${n}$-way multiplexor; depending on the sequence
		of its <var>sel</var> lines, it selects one, and only one, of its ${n}$
		input pins to take input from. Thus, in the schematic above, the
		<var>sel</var> line is actually a ${3}$-bit bus. That bus takes an
		<i>address</i>, and it's fed to both the 8-way multiplexor and 8-way
		demultiplexor as <var>sel</var> inputs. Depending on the particular
		sequence of bits passed to it, both gates select the corresponding
		register. In HDL:

		Examining this implementation, we see that implementing larger RAM
		chips is almost trivial. A RAM64 chip is just a stack of ${8}$ RAM8
		chips. Thus, we again employ an ${8}$-way demultiplexor and an
		${8}$-way multiplexor, only this time we're wiring RAM8 chips instead
		of RAM64 chips. And since a RAM64 chip requires ${6}$ bits to form
		unique addresses, we use ${3}$ bits to access the ${8}$ RAM8 chips, and

		<li>Remove egg and put into plate.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Bap executes the first step and heats the skillet. After a few minutes,
		we hear the fire alarm go off. Running to the kitchen, we see a cloud
		of smoke, the robot staring into a blackening plate. What happened? Bap
		never left the first step; it had no idea which of the steps to execute
		next. All Bap knows is that there's some instruction with a number next
		to it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>program counter (PC)</b>, or more generally, a <b>counter</b>,
		is a chip that solves this problem. The idea is simple: There's a large
		screen next to the robot, displaying a number. That number corresponds
		to the instruction's number. When the screen displays ${0,}$ Bap
		executes step ${0;}$ screen displays ${1,}$ the robot executes step
		${1;}$ screen displays ${2,}$ execute step ${2;}$ and so on. That
		screen is program counter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Program counters are not limited to just incrementing its current
		count. In the algorithm above, if the counter ends at <var>4</var>, Bap
		will cook just ${1}$ egg. But what if we wanted Bap to cook a hundred?
		Well, we just reset the counter to a particular number after
		<var>4</var>. That is, once the counter reaches <var>4</var>, reset it
		to <var>2</var> (not <var>0</var>, since the skillet is already
		heated). In this way, we can get as many fried eggs as we'd like.
	</p>
	<p>
		From our iron chef, we see that the program counter provides a feature
		we don't have yet: Providing the computer a way to keep track of which
		instruction should be <i>fetched</i> and <i>executed</i> next. To do
		so, the PC has three operations:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<var><mark>reset()</mark></var
			>: Fetch the first instruction (<var>PC = 0</var>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<var><mark>next()</mark></var
			>: Fetch the next instruction (<var>PC++</var>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<var><mark>goto(${n}$)</mark></var> Fetch the instruction ${n}$ (<var
				>PC = ${n}$</var
			>)
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The PC's implementation:</p>
	<pre class="language-verilog"><code>
		module PC(in[16], load, inc, reset);

			input  in[16], load, inc, reset;
			output out[16];
		
			PARTS:
				Mux16(a=in, b=false, sel=reset, out=in1);
		
				Or(a=load, b=reset, out=sw1);

	<h2>Machine Language</h2>
	<p>
		With our work so far, we now have three key chips: Registers (which can
		be wired together to form RAM or ROM), an ALU (for performing hardware
		level arithmetic and logical operations), and a PC (to keep track of
		which instruction to perform). The next step is to find a way to pass
		data between all three of these chips. But before we begin thinking
		about implementing the connections and designing how the information
		should flow, we should set a goal. That is, answering the following
		question: How does the user control the machine?
	</p>
	<p>
		Answering this question requires us to forget about all of the
		low-level hardware details, focusing instead on what the end-product
		looks like. Why this sudden jump? Because we must organize our work.
		The fact is, a full-fledged computer is complex in its implementation
		details. Without a clear goal in mind, we risk producing poor designs
		or losing traction in certain areas. The remedy is a common software
		design technique called the <b>top-down approach</b>
		&mdash; we establish the final product's behavior and appearance to the
		user, then break it down into its component parts. In doing so, we gain
		an organized workflow defined by clear paths to particular endpoints.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fortunately, the renowned mathematician and computer scientist John von
		Neumann gives us the final product's high-level design:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/von_neumann_architecture.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice how the diagram above looks very much like the chips we've
		designed so far. This is no coincidence. Servers, laptops, desktops,
		tablets, mobile phones, smart watches &mdash; they're all chips called
		<b>computer systems</b>. There are various ways to design a computer
		system, just as there are various ways to design latches and
		flip-flops. The design above is called the
		<b>von Neumann architecture</b>. Other designs include the
		<i>Harvard architecture</i>, the <i>dataflow architecture</i>, the
		<i>transport triggered architecture</i>, and several others. Of these
		various architectures, the von Neumann architecture is undoubtedly the
		most common, so we will structure our final product accordingly.
	</p>
	<p>The computer system works as such:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Input &mdash; data &mdash; is fed to the computer.</li>
		<li>
			The data is fed into memory. Inside the memory, there is some program
			that instructs the CPU what to do with the data.
		</li>
		<li>The memory sends these instructions to the CPU.</li>
		<li>
			The CPU executes the instructions, and the resulting outputs are
			returned as the computer system's output.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Our first focus is on the second step &mdash; the program containing
		the CPU's instructions. All of these instructions, as a whole, comprise
		the computer system's <b>machine language</b>. Machine language
		instructions can be classified into three categories:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Data instructions.</b> These instructions tell the CPU to perform
			a particular operation. We can also think of these instructions as
			<i>operation instructions</i>. For example, an instruction to add, an
			instruction to subtract, negate, and so on.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Control instructions.</b> These instructions tell the CPU which
			instruction to perform next. For example, if the CPU is currently at
			the fourth instruction in the program, the fifth instruction might
			say, <q>Go back to instruction three.</q>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Address instructions.</b> These instructions can be thought of as
			<i>operand instructions</i> &mdash; they tell the CPU what to operate
			on. As we know, data is stored in memory. Data instructions tell the
			CPU where in memory it can find the necessary data it needs to
			perform its operation instructions. For example, suppose the
			instruction sent to the CPU is to execute <var>x = 9 + 8</var>. This
			instruction consists of two operation instructions, <var>+</var> and
			<var>=</var>. However, it also consists of addresses: The register
			storing <var>9</var>, the register storing <var>8</var>, and the
			register referred to as <var>x</var>. To actually perform the
			operation, the CPU must know where the <var>x</var>, <var>9</var>,
			and <var>8</var> are in memory.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		So what do these machine language instructions look like? They're just
		ones and zeroes. For example, a machine language might have the
		instruction <var>1000101</var> mean <q>perform addition.</q> Or it
		might have the instruction <var>1010111</var> mean
		<q>go to step four.</q> It's entirely up to the computer system's
		architect.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once we have machine language instructions implemented and a way to
		feed these instructions to memory, the computer system is essentially
		complete. For example, to compute <var>a = 1 + 9</var>, the user could
		just pass the following inputs in order:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>0010 0110 0001</li>
		<li>0010 0111 1001</li>
		<li>1001 0110 0111</li>
		<li>0010 1111 1001</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		To say that this isn't user-friendly is an understatement. Think about
		all of the complicated we have computers do in the modern era. If the
		only way we could command a computer is to manually feed ones and
		zeros, daily computer tasks we take for granted like returning the
		current time would be difficult to write, let alone more complicated
		operations like simulating pressure systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because machine languages are unwieldy, computer scientists,
		specifically <b>programming language designers</b>, create programming
		languages that allow us to instead write something like:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>let a = 1 + 9</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		This data input is an instruction in some
		<b>high-level language</b>. That language might be C, Java, Python,
		JavaScript, etc. How these instructions are understood by the computer
		is a complicated process that we'll explore in great detail later. The
		idea, however, is that the instructions are fed to a program called the
		<b>compiler</b>, which transforms these instructions into the
		computer's machine language. To transform the high-level language
		instruction into a machine language instruction, the compiler designer
		must define the high-level language instructions in terms of machine
		language instructions.
	</p>
	<p>
		All the possible instructions in a given computer system's machine
		language is called the computer system's <b>instruction set</b>. The
		computer system's instruction set is its most valuble interface.
		Without an instruction set, there's no way to connect hardware to
		software.
	</p>
	<p>
		How is this connection made? By and large, by tying the machine
		language instructions directly to hardware. For example, a machine
		language instruction for addition might translate to having the ALU
		output from its
		<var>x+y</var> pin. These instructions are called
		<i>simple instructions</i> &mdash; instructions directly tied to
		hardware. However, the machine language can also have
		<i>compound instructions</i> &mdash; an instruction to execute a
		sequence of simple or other compound instructions. In doing so, we can
		provide unique instructions for operations not directly implemented by
		the hardware. Because of the ability to write both simple and composite
		instructions, the computer architect must answer several questions when
		designing the computer system's machine language:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<i
				>What operations should be encapsulated into a single
				instruction?</i
			>
			For example, do we want a unique instruction for division? Computing
			remainders? Squaring?
		</li>
		<li>
			<i
				>What control mechanisms do we want encapsulated into a single
				instruction?</i
			>
			Maybe we want specific instructions for <var>if</var>,
			<var>else-if</var>, and <var>else</var>. Or specific instructions for
			a while loop.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i
				>What data types, if any, do we want the instruction set to
				support?</i
			>
			At the machine language level, a <i>data type</i> is an instruction
			that indicates how many bits comprise a single a unit of data. The
			machine language might have no data types, in which cases every piece
			of data is defined restricted to the computer's
			<i>word size</i> &mdash; a register's width. If the word size is
			${16}$ bits, the user can only work with ${16}$ bits at any given
			moment. Alternatively, we might have many data types &mdash; ${8}$
			bits, ${16}$ bits, ${32}$ bits, and so on. This allows us to directly
			support floating point arithmetic directly within hardware.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Answering these questions requires analyzing tradeoffs. The more
		instructions we have, the bigger the instruction set. And the bigger
		the instruction set, the easier it is to create and support complex
		operations on the computer system. But that also means we get a more
		expensive bill, in terms of time and money. The larger an instruction
		set is over a smaller silicon area, the more time it takes to execute
		instructions. We can reduce that time by getting more silicon, but that
		requires more funding and resigning ourselves to a larger device.
	</p>

	<section id="assembly_language">
		<h3>Assembly Language</h3>
		<p>
			To help the compiler designers (and later, as we'll see, operating
			system designers) construct these definitions, the computer architect
			provides <i>mnemonics</i> for the machine language instructions. For
			example, suppose the computer system has a machine language
			instruction:
		</p>
		<div id="machine_language_instruct_add"></div>
		<p>
			The make these machine language instructions easier to work with, the
			computer architect creates a system of mnemonics to organize and
			easily identify instructions in the machine language:
		</p>
		<div id="assembly_language_instruct_add"></div>
		<p>
			In this case, the mnemonic <var>ADD</var> corresponds to the machine
			language instruction <var>010001</var>, and means the operation
			instruction <q>perform addition</q>. The mnemonic
			<var>R2</var> corresponds to the instruction <var>0011</var>, which
			means <q>register 2</q>. And the mnemonic <var>R1</var> corresponds
			to the instruction <var>0010</var>, which means
			<q>register 1.</q> Putting it all together, when the compiler or
			operating system designer writes:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD R2 R1</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			They're writing the instruction,
			<q>Add the contents of registers 1 and 2,</q> which translates to
			<var>01000100110010</var>. These mnemonics &mdash; <var>ADD</var>,
			<var>R1</var>, <var>R2</var>, and many others &mdash; are called
			<b>assembly language instructions</b>, and they constitute the
			computer system's <b>assembly language</b>. Since assembly language
			instructions are just mnemonics for machine language instructions,
			the computer system's <i>instruction set</i> can also be defined as
			the set of all possible assembly language instructions we can write
			in the computer system.
		</p>
		<p>
			But wait. How does the computer understand <var>ADD</var>,
			<var>R2</var>, and <var>R1</var>? Isn't this the same problem we saw
			with compilers? While it may seem like it's turtles all the way down,
			the last turtle is the <b>assembler</b> &mdash; a program that
			converts the assembly language instructions to machine language
			instructions. This program is written in machine language; at least
			at first. Later, when we examine an assembler's implementation, we'll
			see a technique called <i>bootstrapping</i>, which makes modern
			assembler design easier than it sounds.
		</p>
		<p>
			In designing an assembly language, we want to keep it extremely
			simple while also providing some form of readability (that is, after
			all, why assembly language is provided in the first place).
			Accordingly, some operations are so common that assembly language
			designers provide more concise syntax. For example, instead of having
			the user write <var>R2</var>, a better design would be to have the
			user write:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD Mem[249] Mem[250]</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Recall that main memory is just a giant stack of registers, each with
			unique addresses. Thus, the symbol <var>Mem</var> indicates that
			we're writing a data instruction (i.e., access a particular
			register), and the numbers <var>249</var> and <var>250</var> refer to
			the index of that register in main memory. Thus, wherever we write
			<var>Mem[250]</var>, we're referring to the register with the index
			<var>250</var>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can go a step further and provide an even better design: Instead
			of having the user write <var>Mem[250]</var>, we can design the
			assembly language to understand:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD x y</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Here, <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are called a <b>symbols</b> or
			<b>names</b> the user provides to refer to particular registers. When
			the user sends these instructions to the assembler, the assembler
			sees these symbols, and automatically translates the <var>x</var> and
			<var>y</var> into some unoccupied memory location. For example, if
			the registers <var>Mem[135]</var> and <var>Mem[136]</var> are free,
			<var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are translated into
			<var>Mem[135]</var> and <var>Mem[136]</var>.
		</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="memory_hierarchy">
	<h2>Memory Organization</h2>
	<p>
		Thinking about how the assembler might translate these symbols into
		memory addresses, we notice an additional factor we have to consider
		when designing the computer system's instruction set &mdash;
		<i>addressing</i>. If the computer system has a large amount of memory,
		then our computer must work with long memory addresses. And the longer
		a memory address is, the longer it takes for the CPU to perform its
		operations, since it can only execute its instructions once it's
		received all of the addresses bits. This time delay is further
		increased by the fact that the CPU also has to access the long address.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fortunately, von Neumann provided a solution to this problem: Instead
		of implementing main memory as just one giant block, we implement it as
		a <b>memory hierarchy</b>:
	</p>
	<img
		src="{% static 'images/memory_hierarchy.svg' %}"
		alt="memory hierarchy"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
	<p>
		Memory hierarchy is system for organizing memory. The idea is that we
		take all of the computer's registers, and divvy them up into four
		places. A small amount of registers are given to the CPU. These
		registers are called the <b>processor registers</b>. A slightly larger
		amount of registers are placed immediately next to the CPU. These
		registers are called <b>caches</b>. A large amount of registers are
		placed in <i>main memory</i>, close to the cache but further from the
		CPU. The largest amount of registers are found in the
		<i>disk</i> (i.e., secondary memory); close to main memory but the
		furthest from the CPU.
	</p>
	<p>
		When arranged in this sequential manner, we see that the closer we are
		to the CPU, the shorter the address. Thus, the processor registers are
		the fastest registers to read and write, followed by the cache and main
		memory. The disk's registers are the furthest from the CPU, and take
		the longest to read and write.
	</p>

	<section id="processor_registers">
		<h3>Processor Registers</h3>
		<p>
			Given how fast processor registers are, they're used for a few key
			operations. Some of the registers are <b>data registers</b>. These
			registers are used to store the necessary data for completing an
			operation's execution. For example, if the CPU must execute
			<var>ADD x y</var>, the data contents of <var>x</var> and
			<var>y</var> are stored inside the data registers to perform the
			computation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the registers are <b>address registers</b>. These registers
			are used to store some address outside the CPU, perhaps in main
			memory. For example, suppose the instruction <var>DEF x y</var> means
			<q>assign the value in <var>y</var> to the address <var>x</var>.</q>
			To execute this instruction, the CPU might store the value stored in
			<var>y</var> in some data register, then store the address
			correspoding to <var>y</var> inside an address register.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="addressing_mode">
		<h3>Addressing Modes</h3>
		<p>
			Using memory hierarchy, we have different ways to read and write
			registers, called <b>addressing modes</b>. These modes are triggered
			by the way the assembly language instructions are written.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Immediate addressing</b> is the fastest addressing mode. We're
			explicitly providing data to the CPU:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD 1 2</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b>Register addressing</b> is the next fastest addressing mode. If
			the data's already stored inside the CPU's data registers, we can
			simply provide the Assembly language's instruction representing the
			registers:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD R1 R2</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			<b>Direct addressing</b> is the next fastest. Here, we're explicitly
			specifying the address:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD R1 M[321]</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Finally, the slowest form of addressing is indirect addressing. Here,
			we're using symbols to denote addresses, so the CPU must wait to
			receive the addresses:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>ADD x y</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="instruction_sets">
	<h2>Instruction Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Within the memory hierarchy, registers comprising the computer's main
		memory fall into one of two, physically separate chips: RAM (Random
		Access Memory) and ROM (Read-only Memory). RAM is what's used to store
		the data the user passes as inputs to the computer system. As such, we
		can think of RAM as <i>data memory</i>. For example, the register
		<var>RAM[347]</var> might store the value <var>9</var>, in which case
		<var>RAM[347] = 9</var>. Or, as a ${16}$-bit value:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<var>RAM[347] = 0000 0000 0000 1001</var>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In contrast, the ROM is what's used to store the computer's machine
		language instructions. For example, suppose the instruction for
		<var>ADD</var> is the number <var>4402</var>. This instruction might be
		stored in the ROM register <var>ROM[289]</var>, in which case
		<var>ROM[289] = 4402</var>. Or, in binary:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<var>ROM[289] = 0001 0001 0011 0010</var>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The ROM, RAM, and CPU are the computer system's most important chips.
		Accordingly, the wires transporting the bits to and from these chips
		have special names. If the computer system is comprised of, say,
		strictly ${16}$-bit registers, a <q>bus</q> is a bundle of ${16}$
		wires. The bus moving instructions from the ROM to the CPU comprise the
		<b>instruction bus</b>. The bus transporting data from RAM to the CPU
		comprises the <b>data bus</b>. And the buses transporting addresses
		from the RAM to the CPU comprise the <b>address buses</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Machine language instructions, at the end of the day, are just numbers.
		Accordingly, the number of bits that the computer architect decides to
		use to form a single instruction determines how many possible
		instructions the machine language can express. This number is called
		the computer system's <b>instruction size.</b> For example, if the
		instruction size is ${16,}$ there are ${2^{16} = 65~536}$ possible
		instructions. Again, that doesn't mean we have the architect must use
		all of those possibilities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nevertheless, because of how many instructions we might want to
		support, it's helpful to organize the instructions. To do so, we can
		associate a select number of registers to associate instructions with.
		Say we select three registers &mdash; a data register, an address
		register, a control register, and some register in the RAM. Next, we
		give them names: The <i>D-register</i>, the <i>A-register</i>, the
		<i>C-register</i>, and the <i>M-register</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once we've selected these three registers, we give them a particular
		intepretation. That is to say, we pretend like they have a particular
		meaning when we design the instruction set. In this case, we'll
		interpret the D-register as the register storing data, the A-register
		as the register storing an address, and the M-register the register
		address stored in the A-register.
	</p>
	<p>
		With these registers selected, we can organize our instruction set into
		<b>instruction classes</b> &mdash; groups of instructions that share
		some common functionality. For example, the an instruction set might
		consist of two instruction classes: A-instructions (instructions for
		<i>addressing</i>) and C-instructions (instructions for
		<i>controlling</i> the order instructions are executed). Later, we'll
		see why organizing our instructions into discrete, distinguishable
		groups &mdash; instruction classes &mdash; is so useful. For now, let's
		go over what these instructions classes do.
	</p>

	<section id="a_instructions">
		<h3>A-instructions</h3>
		<p>
			An A-instruction is short for <i>addressing instruction</i>.
			A-instructions are what allow us to communicate to the CPU that we're
			referring to a particular register. This is done by setting the
			A-register to a particular value. For instance, the machine language
			might have the instruction:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>@17</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			which tells the CPU to set the A-register to <var>17</var>. By
			setting the A-register to <var>17</var>, the M-register is now
			<var>RAM[17]</var>. The machine language might then allow us to
			write:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>@17</li>
			<li>M=5</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			which stores he value <var>5</var> inside the RAM memory address
			<var>RAM[17]</var>.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="c_instructions">
		<h3>C-instructions</h3>
		<p>
			A <b>C-instruction</b> (short for <i>control instruction</i>) tells
			the CPU what instruction to perform next. A C-instruction might have
			the form:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li><b>⟨DEST⟩ =</b> ⟨COMP⟩ <b>: ⟨JUMP⟩</b></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In the syntax above, <var>DEST</var> stands for <i>destination</i>,
			<var>COMP</var> for <i>computation</i>, and <var>JUMP</var> for
			<i>jump</i>. Both <var>DEST</var> and <var>JUMP</var> are optional.
			We could just jump.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <var>COMP</var> field can be set to any of the following
			computations:

			<h4>Assignment</h4>
			<p>
				Suppose we want to store the value <var>-5</var> to the D-register.
				We can do so by writing:
			</p>
			<ol class="alg">
				<li>D=-1</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Suppose we want to store the value <var>8</var> in register
				<var>128</var> in main memory. This implies storing <var>8</var> in
				<var>RAM[128]</var>. Because this register is not one of the
				<var>DEST</var> registers (i.e., not a processor register), we
				first need an A-instruction:
			</p>
			<ol class="alg">
				<li>@RAM[128] <var>// A=128, M=RAM[128]</var></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The result of this A-instruction is that the A-register now stores
				the address <var>128</var>. And if the A-register stores the
				address <var>128</var>, the M-register is <var>RAM[128]</var>.
				Since <var>M</var> is one of the possible <var>DEST</var> values,
				all that's left is a C-instruction:
			</p>
			<ol class="alg">
				<li>@RAM[128] <var>// A=128, M=RAM[128]</var></li>
				<li>M=8</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				As an aside, seeing how this is done in assembly demonstrates just
				how convenient higher-level languages are. In a sense, source code
				(code written in a higher-level language) is really just syntactic
				sugar for Assembly code (which is just syntactic sugar for binary
				code). When we write some high-level code like:
			</p>
			<pre class="language-c"><code>
				int x = 5;
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				The equivalent Assembly code might look something like (suppose
				<var>x</var> is the address <var>15</var>):
			</p>
			<ol class="alg">
				<li>@10 <var>// Store 10 in the A-register</var></li>
				<li>D=10 <var>// Store A's value in the D-register</var></li>
				<li>@15 <var>// Store 15 in the A-register</var></li>
				<!-- prettier-ignore -->
				<li>M=D<var>// Assign the value 10 to RAM[15] (the address called x)</var>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section id="conditional_control">
			<h4>Conditional Control</h4>
			<p>
				Now suppose we want to jump to an instruction if the D-register's
				value is
				<var>0</var>. Notice that this is similar to the guard clause for a
				while-loop. To communicate this instruction, we again start with an
				A-instruction:
			</p>
			<ol class="alg">
				<li>@56 <var>// A=56, M=ROM[56]</var></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Following this line, we write:</p>

				<li>D-1; JEQ <var>// if (D-1 ≡ 0), goto A</var></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This instruction <var>JEQ</var> means
				<q>jump if equal to <var>0</var></q
				>. Putting it all together, we're communicating the command,
				<q
					>If subtracting ${1}$ from the value D-register's stored value is
					${0,}$ jump to the instruction stored in <var>ROM[56]</var>.</q

		<h3>Opcodes</h3>
		<p>
			As we've mentioned before, a computer system's machine language can
			be expressed in two ways:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>binary code, and</li>
			<li>symbolic code</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The machine language's binary code can be thought of as its purest,
			or raw, form. The symbolic code, however, is the more human-readable
			form, and it's what comprises the computer system's assembly
			language. That is, the symbolic code is just a more convenient way to
			write the same instruction in binary code:
		</p>
		<div id="symbolic_binary"></div>
		<p>A-instructions, as we saw, have the syntax:</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>
				<span class="orangeText">@</span
				><span class="blueText">⟨VALUE⟩</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			where <var>${0 \leq \texttt{⟨VALUE⟩} \leq 32~767}$</var>. Why does
			${\texttt{⟨VALUE⟩}}$ have this bound? To answer this question, we
			answer a related question: How does the CPU know that some sequence
			<var>0000 0000 0001 0001</var> is an A-instruction and not just some
			number?
		</p>
		<p>
			Through an <b>opcode</b> (short for <i>operation code</i>). When we
			write the instruction:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>
				<span class="orangeText">@</span><span class="blueText">21</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>we're really sending to the CPU is:</p>
		<div id="a_instruction_array"></div>
		<p>
			The most-significant bit, colored orange above, is the
			<i>opcode</i>. This bit is what tells the CPU that the bitstream is
			an A-instruction. The ${15}$ bits following the opcode, colored blue,
			correspond to the value we want loaded into the A-register. That
			value is <var>000 0000 0001 0101</var>, which is <var>21</var> in
			decimal. Examining this value, we see why we have the bound
			<var>${0 \leq \texttt{⟨VALUE⟩} \leq 32~767).}$</var> Because we have
			${15}$ bits to work with, we can represent ${2^{15} = 32~768}$
			possible numbers. Starting at ${0,}$ the largest value we can
			represent is ${2^{15} - 1 = 32~767.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			The same idea &mdash; using opcodes to signal to the CPU what
			instruction we're referring to &mdash; applies to C-instructions.
			Recall the Assembly syntax for the C-instruction:
		</p>
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>
				<span class="redText">⟨DEST⟩</span> =
				<span class="blueText">⟨COMP⟩</span>;
				<span class="greenText">⟨JUMP⟩</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In binary syntax, this is the ${16}$-bit instruction:</p>
		<div id="c_instruction_binary"></div>
		<p>
			Once more, the most-significant bit, colored orange above, is the
			opcode. This tells the CPU that this is a C-instruction. It should
			now be clear why dividing our instruction set into discrete groups is
			needed. Recall that we only have two kinds of instructions,
			A-instructions and C-instructions. If opcodes in the machine language
			consist of just ${1}$ bit, then computer system's instruction set can
			be divided into ${2}$ kinds of instructions, since there are two
			unique sequences, <var>0</var> or <var>1</var> (${2^1 = 2}$). If we
			reserve ${2}$ bits for an opcode, then the instruction set can be
			divided into ${2^2 = 4}$ kinds of instructions.<sup></sup>
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				The hypothetical machine language we've been working with is
				extremely simple. The x86 architecture, which underlies the Intel
				processors used by many computers today, can use up to ${2}$ bytes
				for opcodes &mdash; ${1}$ byte, followed by another byte. This
				leads to ${2^8 + 2^8 = 512}$ possible instruction classes. While
				it's unlikely that Intel uses all ${512}$ possibilities, such large
				opcode sizes indicate just how massive the x86 instruction set is
				&mdash; it has more instructions than there are pages in the Z80
				architecture's instruction set manual. It's likely that no one
				&mdash; perhaps not even Intel &mdash; knows how many instructions
				the x86 has. As we'll see in the
				<span class="title">assembler</span> section, machine languages are
				constructed by building on top of previous machine languages,
				alongside supporting backwards compatibility. This means that a
				significant amount of instructions in the x86 originate in much
				older, no longer documented architectures like the i8086.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Following the opcode are two bits. These bits are called
			<b>padding bits</b>, and by convention, they're set to <var>1</var>.
			We'll see shortly why a machine language instruction might want to
			use padding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following the padding bits are seven bits (colored blue) are used to
			specify the computation (<var>COMP</var>) we want performed. The
			first bit, labeled <var>a</var>, is called the
			<b>computation bit</b>. The ${6}$ bits following, labeled
			${\texttt{c}_n,}$ are the <b>control bits</b> sent to the ALU. All
			together, these bits comprise the <b>computation bitfield</b>. As we
			saw in the <span class="title">alu</span> section, the ALU uses these
			control bits to determine which computation to carry out.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following the control bits are the
			<b>destination bits</b> colored red, which comprise the destination
			the <b>destination bitfield</b> (<var>DEST</var>). And following
			these bits are the <b>jump bits</b>, colored green, which the
			comprise the <b>jump bitfield</b> (<var>JUMP</var>).
		</p>
		<section id="computation_bits">
			<h4>Computation Bitfield</h4>
			<p>
				The computation field consists of ${7}$ bits, ${1}$ bit to specify
				the computation, and ${6}$ bits to instruct the ALU. As we saw,
				with ${6}$ bits, the ALU can perform ${2^6 = 64}$ unique
				operations. Thus, with ${7}$ bits, we can specify ${128}$ unique
				computations. We won't list all of the possible computations, but a
				small subset of the possible computations might look like:

			<div id="computation_field"></div>
		</section>

		<section id="destination_field">
			<h4>The Destination Bitfield</h4>
			<p>
				The destination bitfield &mdash; <var>DEST</var> &mdash; specifies
				the location we want stored. Because the destination bitfield
				consists of ${3}$ bits, we have ${2^3}$ possible bitfields we can
				assign meaning to:
			</p>
			<div id="destination_bitfield"></div>
		</section>

		<section id="jump_field">
			<h4>The Jump Bitfield</h4>
			<p>
				Finally, we have the jump bitfield &mdash; <var>JUMP</var> &mdash;
				which specifies the condition for jumping. Here, we have ${3}$
				bits, so there are ${2^3 = 8}$ possible conditions we can express:
			</p>
			<div id="jump_bitfield"></div>
		</section>

		<section id="padding_bits">
			<h4>Padding Fields</h4>
			<p>
				Having laid out all the possible C-instructions, we can likely
				guess why a machine language instruction might use padding bits.
				When designing a machine language, the computer architect might
				only have a small amount of instructions he or she wants to
				implement. However, if instructions in the language are always
				${n}$-bits long &mdash; in our cases, ${16}$ &mdash; padding bits
				are useful for establishing separation between the different
				bitfields, and to restrict instructions to certain lengths.

	<h2>Peripherals</h2>
	<p>
		One question that might have been looming in the back of our minds: How
		do we connect peripherals? That is, how does the computer system take
		input from, or return output to, devices like the keyboard, mouse,
		camera, printers, speakers, monitors, etc.?
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many ways to connect peripherals and they vary across
		devices. The most common connection method is
		<b>memory-mapped input-output (MMIO)</b>. MMIO assumes that the
		peripheral has its own registers and processor (which for most
		peripherals is the case). When the user passes input to the peripheral,
		the input is transformed into ones and zeros, and the peripheral's
		processor, following its internal logic, stores them in the
		peripheral's registers. These registers are directly <i>mapped</i> to
		registers reserved for input and output on the computer system, called
		<b>device control registers</b>. And because of the device control
		registers are directly mapped, or directly connected, to the
		peripheral's registers, the computer system can access the device's
		registers as if the registers were part of the computer system.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, some peripherals take inputs from the computer. For example,
		consider a printer. Modern printers have a plethora of settings: Print
		black and white, print color, use a particular paper dimension, etc.
		Because of these functionalities, these peripherals are very much like
		computer systems &mdash; they have complex circuitry implementing
		memory, a processor, a program counter, ALU, and so on. More
		importantly, they also have their own machine language. Thus, to send
		instructions to these peripherals via our computer system, we must send
		the sequence of bits as set defined by the peripheral's instruction
		set.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is done by special programs called <b>device drivers</b>, which
		usually come with the peripheral. The device driver is essentially a
		manual instructing the CPU which sequence of bits it should send to the
		peripheral's register. Think of an HP printer. To get the printer to
		work on our computer, it usually comes with a small booklet instructing
		us to download and install some accompanying software. That software
		contains the peripheral's device driver.
	</p>
	<section id="primary_peripherals">
		<h3>Main Peripherals</h3>
		<p>
			There are numerous peripherals we can connect to computer systems:
			Mice, trackpads, microphones, speakers, disk readers, USB ports,
			Ethernet ports, Bluetooth and Wifi antennae, and so on. The two most
			important peripherals, however, are the
			<i>keyboard</i> and <i>display</i>, collectively called the
			<b>main peripherals</b>. They're the most important because without
			these peripherals, controlling the computer system is next to
			impossible. All other peripherals are luxuries, or
			<i>nice-to-haves</i>. We don't need trackpads or mice to control the
			computer, because we can accomplish the same navigation with a
			command line. We also don't need microphones, speakers, or even a way
			to connect to the internet, because none of those are necessary for
			controlling the computer. They're tremendously useful, but they
			aren't indespensible. Accordingly, it's helpful to give special
			attention to how the keyboard and monitor connect to the computer
			system.
		</p>

		<section id="screen">
			<h4>Displays</h4>
			<p>
				A modern display unit (e.g., a laptop screen or a monitor) is a
				matrix of electronic devices called <b>physical pixels</b>. These
				physical pixels can be either red, green, or blue in color. How
				these pixels accomplish this is more electrical engineering than
				computer science, so we won't delve beyond this rudimentary
				understanding. Additionally, to keep things simple, we're going to
				use a simpler display &mdash; the pixels can only be black or
				white, as was the case for early computers. That said, we can
				visualize the display unit as follows:
			</p>
			<div id="display_pixel_array"></div>
			<p>
				Each of the black squares above is a physical pixel. All together,
				they comprise the display.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, from basic data structures and algorithms, we know that
				matrices for a computer are just arrays of arrays. Accordingly,
				each of pixel in the matrix can be identified with a pair of
				indices:
			</p>
			<div id="display_pixel_array_indexed"></div>
			<p>
				To turn the top-left pixel white, we change the color for the pixel
				with the index <var>[3][6]</var> (interpreted as
				<var>[row][column]</var>):
			</p>
			<div id="display_pixel_array_indexed_topLeft"></div>
			<p>By manipulating these pixels, we can display various shapes:</p>
			<div id="display_pixel_array_shape"></div>
			<p>
				Above, we can see what looks like the number <var>1</var>, as
				rendered by a display unit with the <b>display resolution</b>
				<var>9⨉5</var> (<var>9</var> pixels by <var>5</var> pixels). The
				more pixels we have, the <q>sharper</q> the images look:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img
					src="{% static 'images/resolution_1.svg' %}"
					alt="image resolution"
					loading="lazy"
					style="width: 250px"
				/>
				<figcaption>
					Resolutions <var>3⨉3</var>, <var>6⨉6</var>, <var>12⨉12.</var> A
					typical modern display might be <var>1024⨉768.</var>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				We can analogize the phenomenon to basic integral calculus: the
				smaller and smaller we make the blocks (i.e., fitting more pixels
				into a set area), the more things appear smooth. This basic idea
				leads to the <b>ppi (pixels per inch)</b> unit &mdash; the number
				of pixels fit into a ${1 \text{in} \times 1 \text{in}}$ square. For
				example, if the displays above were ${1 \times 1}$ squares, we
				would have the ppis: ${9 \text{ppi},}$ ${36 \text{ppi},}$ and ${144
				\text{ppi}.}$<sup></sup>
			</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					This is why more tech-savvy consumers ask more about a display's
					${\text{ppi}}$ than its resolution. A display with a massive
					resolution is of no use if it consists of just ${4}$ pixels.
					Separately, the terms 360p, 720p, 1080p, and 4k all refer to
					resolution. Specifically, the number of rows of pixels (i.e., the
					height of the display in terms pixels).
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Understanding the display in this manner, we see that to control
				the display, we need registers that map to each of the pixels. And
				in fact, each pixel in a connected display maps to some binary cell
				in a RAM register. The registers housing these cells are placed
				together in a designated data memory area called the
				<b>screen memory map</b>. How big is this memory map?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, suppose we had a display with the resolution
				<var>512⨉256</var>. This means that the display consists of
				${131072}$ pixels. If our computer system's registers can only be
				${16}$-bits wide, a total of ${{131072}/{16} = 8192}$ registers are
				needed to control the display. Thus, each of the pixels in the
				display unit map to registers with indices ${0}$ to ${8191.}$ With
				these mappings, to turn a particular pixel on, we change some
				binary cell in one of the registers to <var>1</var> inside that
				pixel's register, and to turn the pixel off, we change the cell's
				value to <var>0</var>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Question: How do we map each pixel in the display to their
				respective registers? This is somewhat of a challenging question.
				We need a way to represent a ${2}$-dimensional structure as a
				${1}$-dimensional structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				To solve this problem, we must understand our constraints. If a
				computer's register width is ${16}$ bits, read-write operations can
				only be done ${16}$ bits at a time. Why? Because the registers can
				only hold ${16}$ bits at any given moment. This means that data
				values <i>and</i> operations can only be ${16}$ bits long. Thus, to
				change a particular pixel's value, we have to go to that pixel's
				register using a ${16}$-bit address, feed its ${16}$ bits to the
				CPU, and write the CPU's output ${16}$ bits back to the pixel's
				${16}$-bit address.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, so a register can only contain ${16}$ bits. Our display has a
				resolution of <var>512⨉256</var>. Interpreting this in terms of
				matrices, the display consists of ${256}$ rows and ${512}$ columns.
				Viewed in this way, a pixel's location in memory can be found by
				using some formula of two numbers: a <i>row index</i>
				<var>row</var>, and a <i>column index</i> <var>col</var>. Earlier,
				we calculated that we have ${8192}$ registers to work with, each of
				which can only hold ${16}$ bits. With ${16}$ bits, we can represent
				${256}$ unique numbers. Our display has ${256}$ rows, each of which
				has ${512}$ pixels. Dividing ${8192}$ (the number of registers
				we're using) by ${256}$ (the number of unique numbers we can
				represent in each register) we get:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \dfrac{8192}{256} = 32 $$</figure>
			<p>
				Thus, each row in the display can be represented with ${32}$
				sixteen-bit <i>words</i> (i.e., the combined bitstream of the
				${32}$ registers). That is, every ${32}$ registers among the
				${8192}$ registers represents a row. Because each word (i.e., row)
				has ${16}$ bits, we get:
			</p>
			<figure>$$16 \times 32 = 512$$</figure>
			<p>
				which maps to the number of columns we have. Thus, each pixel can
				be turned on or off by changing the value of the ${(\texttt{col}
				\bmod 16)^{\text{th}}}$ bit in the register:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \texttt{RAM}[32 \cdot \texttt{row} + (\text{col} \text{ div }
				16)]$$
			</figure>
			<p>
				To illustrate this mapping technique, let's consider a simpler
				example with a smaller screen and a computer system with a smaller
				register width, say ${4.}$ Suppose we have an
				<var>8⨉4</var> display. We'll give each pixel a label for
				visualization purposes:
			</p>
			<div id="smaller_screen"></div>
			<p>
				Because we have an <var>8⨉4</var> display, there are ${32}$ pixels.
				And because our registers can only hold ${2}$ bits at most, we need
				${\dfrac{32}{2} = 16}$ registers total. Given that our computer
				system only has a register width of ${2}$ bits, we can't fit every
				row of pixels into a single register. Because of this limitation,
				we represent each row with ${4}$ consecutive ${2}$-bit words. I.e.,
				every four registers constitutes a row:
			</p>
			<div id="screen_registers"></div>
			<p>
				Thus, if we want to turn on the pixel <var>c</var>, we first
				determine its row-column index: <var>[0][2]</var>. Using the row
				and column indices, we go to the specific register:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \texttt{RAM}[4 \cdot \texttt{row} +
				(\texttt{col} \text{ div } 2)] &= \texttt{RAM}[4 \cdot 0 + (2
				\text{ div } 2)] \\ &= \texttt{RAM}[0 + 1] \\ &= \texttt{RAM}[1] \\
				\end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				Once we're at that register, we change the bit whose index is
				${\texttt{col} \bmod 2.}$ In this case, that's the bit with the
				index ${2 \bmod 2 = 0.}$ To turn the corresponding pixel on, we
				change that bit from a <var>0</var> to a <var>1</var>:
			</p>
			<div class="horizon">
				<div id="screen_registers_select"></div>
				<div id="smaller_screen_on"></div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Because we have a formula for addressing the pixels, we can place
				all of the pixels' registers in a single chip called
				<var>SCREEN</var>, and refer to any given pixel by writing:
			</p>
			<ul class="syntax">
				<li>SCREEN[A]</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				where <var>A</var> is the address of the pixel's corresponding
				register. This is purely for testing. In production, a display's
				memory map isn't necessarily a separate chip. Instead, it's first
				register, or <i>base address</i>, is designated somewhere in RAM,
				and accessing the screen's pixels is done with:

			<ul class="syntax">
				<li>RAM[b + A]</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				where <var>b</var> is the base address. And to turn the pixel on or
				off, we set the <var>${c}$ % 16</var>th bit of the content in its
				register to <var>0</var> or <var>1</var>. For example,
			</p>
			<p>
				To display images, the physical display is continuously refreshed,
				according to the bits stored in screen memory map's registers. This
				happens many, many times each second. By manipulating the bits in
				these registers, at each frame, what's shown on the physical
				display changes.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="keyboard">
			<h4>Keyboard</h4>
			<p>
				Compared to the display, keyboards are much simpler. Like the
				display, some data memory (RAM) is reserved for the
				<b>keyboard memory map</b>. It turns out, however, that we really
				only need ${16}$ bits to receive input from a keyboard.
				Accordingly, on a ${16}$-bit computer, the keyboard memory map is a
				single ${16}$-bit register that maps to the keyboard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Again like the display, a keyboard is a matrix of <i>keys</i>. The
				keys are connected together in a circuit, forming what's called a
				<b>key matrix</b>. In the default state (no typing), the circuit is
				broken at points directly below each key. Pressing a key is
				essentially a switch &mdash; it closes the circuit and current
				flows to the processor. By designing the circuit a particular way,
				we can generate unique ways of <q>closing the circuit.</q> For
				example, pressing the <var>k</var> key might result in feeding some
				bitstream <var>00101011</var> to the keyboard's processor.
			</p>
			<p>
				This input tells the processor where the keyboard's circuit closed,
				and using its internal logic, it outputs a nonnegative integer
				called the <b>scan code</b>, usually a bitstream of of ${8}$ bits
				(${1}$ byte). That scan code is the integer representation of a
				particular key on the keyboard; every key has a unique scan code.
				How these scan codes are assigned to keys is determined by a
				<b>keyboard standard</b> &mdash; some agreed upon set of rules for
				which numbers represent which keys.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once a key is pressed, the keyboard's processor outputs the scan
				code to the computer system, the computer system receives the scan
				doe as input, and stores it in the keyboard memory map. Once it's
				inside the keyboard memory map, the rest is up to the computer
				system. For example, on a keyboard that follows the PS2 standard,
				the <var>F</var> key has the scan code <var>43</var>. If the
				keyboard outputs ${1}$ byte (most scan codes are ${1}$ or ${2}$
				bytes long), pressing the <var>f</var> key sends the bitstream
				<var>0010 1011</var> to the keyboard memory map. What happens after
				that is up to the computer system. Maybe it results in manipulating
				the display's pixels to show the character <var>f.</var> To do so,
				the computer uses a <b>lookup table</b> to determine what character
				the bitstream <var>0010 1011</var> means. If the computer uses an
				ASCII lookup table, it sees that the scancode <var>43</var> maps to
				<var>102</var> &mdash; the ASCII code for the character lowercase
				<var>f</var> &mdash; and renders accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				An important point to keep in mind about this whole process is that
				as long as the keyboard is connected to a power source (e.g.,
				connecting the cable via USB, or, for Bluetooth keyboards, a
				separate battery) the keyboard is always <q>on.</q> That is to say,
				the keyboard is constantly sending bitstreams to the computer
				following its own internal clock. When no key is pressed, the
				keyboard outputs the scan code <var>0000 0000</var>.

		<h2>Assembly Programs</h2>
		<p>
			In this section, we examine what some of the most common programming
			idioms look like in Assembly. As we'll see, many of the idioms we use
			every day take much longer to write in Assembly. Writing Assembly
			programs is perhaps the greatest way to appreciate higher-level
			languages.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="symbols">
		<h3>Symbols</h3>
		<p>
			Some Assembly languages provide <b>symbols</b>. We can think of these
			as special characters that allow Assembly programmers to write more
			semantically meaningful code. For example, the Assembly language
			might allow its user to write:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>@R25;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Here, the symbol <var>R</var> indicates a register. By providing this
			symbol, the programmer can distinguish between some memory address
			<var>R25</var> and the number <var>25</var>.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="branching">
		<h3>Branching</h3>
		<p>
			Many programming languages provide some form of
			<i>branching.</i> For example, in C, we might write:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-c"><code>
			if (n > 0) {
				x = 1;
			} else {
				x = 0;
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			Once again, much of this syntactic sugar for Assembly. We have no
			notion of if-else in Assembly. Instead, we have the
			<var>goto</var> instructions (C-instructions). The C program above,
			in Assembly, might look like:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>@R0 <var>// A=0, M=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>D=M <var>// D=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>@8 <var>// A=8</var></li>
			<li>D;JGT <var>// If RAM[0] > 0 goto line 8</var></li>
			<li>@R1 <var>// A=1 M=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>M=0 <var>// RAM[1]=0</var></li>
			<li>@10 <var>// A=10</var></li>
			<li>0;JMP <var>// end of program</var></li>
			<li>@R1 <var>// A=1, M=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>M=1 <var>// RAM[1]=1</var></li>
			<li>@10 <var>// A=10</var></li>
			<li>0;JMP <var>// end of program</var></li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Notice the amount of comments we've provided above. Without the
			comments and line numbers, the assembly code looks like:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			@R0
			D=M
			@8
			D;JGT
			@R1
			M=0
			@10
			0;JMP
			@R1
			M=1
			@10
			0;JMP
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			This is extremely cryptic code, and it's another reason why we have
			high-level languages. Because of how cryptic Assembly can be,
			comments and documentation are even more critical in low-level
			programming. Unless we work with compilers, operating systems, or
			low-level systems in general, chances are, we aren't encountering
			Assembly very often. As such, it's unlikely that we, or others, would
			understand what the program above does ${6}$ months from now, let
			alone several years. Always document Assembly code as much as
			possible. As Donald Knuth once explained, our primary task as
			programmers isn't to tell computers what to do &mdash; it's to
			explain to other humans what want the computer to do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of how important documentation is, many Assembly languages
			provide a <b>label</b> construct. Labels are essentially symbols, or
			names, to mark particular locations in the Assembly file. For
			example, our Assembly code above can be written as:
		</p>
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>@R0 <var>// A=0, M=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>D=M <var>// D=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>@POSITIVE <var>// This is a label</var></li>
			<li>D;JGT <var>// If RAM[0] > 0 goto label POSITIVE</var></li>
			<li>@R1 <var>// A=1 M=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>M=0 <var>// RAM[1]=0</var></li>
			<li>@END <var>// Label indicating the end of the program</var></li>
			<li>0;JMP <var>// end of program</var></li>
			<li>(POSITIVE) <var>// Declare label POSITIVE</var></li>
			<li>@R1 <var>// A=1, M=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>M=1 <var>// RAM[1]=1</var></li>
			<li>(END) <var>// Declare label END</var></li>
			<li>@END</li>
			<li>0;JMP <var>// end of program</var></li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="variables">
		<h3>Variables</h3>
		<p>
			What do variables look like in Assembly? For example, suppose we
			wanted to perform the classic switch idiom, presented in most
			introductory programming courses:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-c"><code>
			void switch(int* a, int* b) {
				int temp = *a;
				*a = *b;
				*b = temp;
			}

			int main() {
				int x = 1;
				int y = 2;
				switch(x,y);
				return 0;
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>The same program in some Assembly language might look like:</p>
		<!-- prettier-ignore -->
		<ol class="alg">
			<li>@R1 <var>// A=1, M=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>D=M <var>// D=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>@TEMP <var>// A=${n}$, M=RAM[${n}$]</var></li>
			<li>M=D <var>// RAM[${n}$]=RAM[1]; store bits in RAM[1] in RAM[${n}]$</var></li>
			<li>@R0 <var>// A=0; M=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>D=M <var>// D=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>@R1 <var>// A=1; M=RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>M=D <var>// RAM[1]=RAM[0]; store bits in RAM[0] in RAM[1]</var></li>
			<li>@TEMP <var>// A=${n}$, M=RAM[${n}$]</var></li>
			<li>D=M <var>// D=RAM[${n}$]</var></li>
			<li>@R0 <var>// A=0, M=RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>M=D <var>// RAM[0]=RAM[${n}$]; store bits in RAM[${n}$] in RAM[0]</var></li>
			<li>(END)</li>
			<li>@END</li>
			<li>0;JMP</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In the code above, <var>TEMP</var> is just some variable name. When
			we write <var>@TEMP</var>, what we're really writing is
			<var>A=${n,}$</var> where ${n}$ is some number corresponding to a
			free memory location. Thus, when we write <var>@TEMP</var>, we tell
			the computer to find some location in memory that's not currently
			occupied. If the computer finds, say, memory location
			<var>RAM[27]</var>, the <var>@TEMP</var> symbol is replaced with
			<var>@27</var>, and we get <var>A=27, M=RAM[27]</var>.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="iteration">
		<h3>Iteration</h3>
		<p>
			How about iteration? What does this look like in Assembly? For
			example, consider some code that computes the sum of the natural
			numbers up to ${n:}$
		</p>
		<pre class="language-c"><code>
			int sum = 0;
			int i = 1;
			int n = 100;
			while (i <= n) {
				sum += i;
				i++;
			}
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			In Assembly, the code would appear as the code below. To aid in
			understanding the code, comments are written in a separate block to
			right. Notice that the variables are really just consecutive memory
			addresses that the CPU finds, per the machine language specification:

		<p>
			Accomplishing the same task in Assembly takes many more lines. Before
			we see the program, we should point out a few things about arrays,
			and pointers more generally.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, there's no such thing as an <q>array</q> at the hardware
			level. An array is just an abstraction &mdash; a mental construct we,
			as programmers, have concocted to help think about problems. More
			specifically, arrays exist because the high-level language designer
			provided syntax for them. That syntax is syntactic sugar for a
			particular sequence of instructions in Assembly. When the computer
			system's assembler translates these instructions into machine code,
			all the CPU does is execute them. The CPU does not know what an
			<q>array</q> is.
		</p>
		<p>
			The array instructions, however, are unique in that they always have
			two key components: (1) some <i>base address</i> and (2) some
			positive integer. As we know, arrays are contiguous (its values are
			immediately next to one another). This is made possible because the
			CPU uses the base address and that constant to read and write
			registers.

			can see that the variables <var>arr</var> and <var>i</var> are used
			specifically for addressing &mdash; <var>arr</var> gives the base
			address, and <var>i</var> is used to increment the address number. In
			a higher-level language like C, these variables are called
			<b>pointers</b>. More specifically, pointers are what allow us to
			utilize register indices, rather than the contents of those registers
			themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Viewed in this way, we see that <i>pointer arithmetic</i> really
			isn't that different from regular integer arithmetic. It's just
			computer arithmetic with some constraints. Moreover, pointer
			arithmetic is just arithmetic on register indices &mdash; we're using
			register indices as data.

	<h2>The von Neumann Architecture</h2>
	<p>
		We now have a broad understanding how our computer system should be
		structured. The next step is to put all of our components together
		&mdash; the registers, CPU, input and output, and many others. To do
		so, we begin by examining how information flows in the von Neumann
		architecture.
	</p>
	<section id="buses">
		<h3>Buses</h3>
		<p>
			One way to think about a computer system is to imagine it as a large,
			sprawling city. Each of the components &mdash; the CPU, ALU, RAM,
			ROM, PC, and so on &mdash; are large plants with roads connecting
			them. These roads are <i>wires</i>. All of these roads, however,
			eventually connect to three major highways called <b>buses</b>. A bus
			is simply a collection of many wires. These three major buses are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>The control bus</b>. This bus transfers
				<i>control information</i> &mdash; the actual instructions telling
				which component to do what at any given moment.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The address bus</b>. This bus transfers
				<i>address information</i> &mdash; the bits that tell the CPU where
				particular registers are located.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The data bus</b>. This bus transfers
				<i>data information</i> &mdash; the actual bits stored in
				registers.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here's a general schematic of what these buses look like:</p>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/buses_von_neumann_architecture.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
		/>

		<p>Let's go over these connections individually.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="alu_vn">
		<h3>The ALU</h3>
		<p>
			First, there's a data bus connection to the ALU. The ALU, as we know,
			performs all of the computer's computations. Operations like
			addition, subtraction, negation, logical and bitwise operations, and
			so on. The ALU receives data information from the data bus, and
			returns its results back to the data bus, where it's sent to either
			main main memory or the processor registers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alongside the data bus, the ALU also has a connection to the control
			bus. The ALU needs this connection for two reasons:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The ALU only works if it receives its control bits, and these
				control bits must be sent through the control bus.
			</li>
			<li>
				Because instructions are just bits, and the actual sequence and
				execution of instructions is performed through the ALU's
				computations, the ALU is also responsible for sending instructions.
				Those instructions must be sent through the control bus.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<section id="processor_registers_vn">
		<h3>The Processor Registers</h3>
		<p>
			Second, the processor registers. Processor registers are used to
			store intermediate results during computations, so they need a
			connection to the data bus. Results from the ALU are sent to the data
			bus, then sent to the registers. When the ALU needs one of its
			intermediate results to perform a computation, the contents of the
			register storing those intermediate results are sent to the data bus
			and to the ALU.
		</p>
		<p>
			The processor registers also need a connection to the address bus. As
			we know, some processor registers &mdash; address registers &mdash;
			are used to specify addresses. When we want to access a particular
			register
			<var>RAM[874]</var>, the following sequence occurs:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Control bits are sent to the ALU.</li>
			<li>The ALU sends instructions to memory.</li>
			<li>
				Memory sends the bits comprising the address of that particular
				register to the the proccessor registers, where's it's stored in
				one of the address registers.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Additionally, the registers also have connection to the control bus.
			To specify which register stores what data and which register to
			output data from, instructions must be sent from the the ALU. And
			once again, instructions must be sent through the control bus.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="ram">
		<h3>The RAM</h3>
		<p>
			The last major component is main memory. Like the registers, main
			memory has three connections: a connection to the control bus, a
			connection to the address bus, and a connection to the data bus.
			These three connections are necessary because:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The ALU needs to know the addresses of registers in main memory to
				use those registers. Those addresses must be sent through the
				address bus.
			</li>
			<li>
				For main memory to output its addresses, it must receive
				instructions from the ALU, and those instructions must be sent
				through the control bus.
			</li>
			<li>
				The registers in main memory store data. To store data, it must
				receive the data in the first place, and data must be sent through
				the data bus.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Examining memory, we see two regions of registers:
			<b>data memory</b> and <b>program memory</b>. Data memory registers
			are used to store actual, <i>substantive data</i> &mdash; user input,
			integers, address number, keyboard input, screen input, and so on.
			Program memory registers consist of <i>procedural data</i> &mdash;
			the instructions for what to do with the substantive data. The
			program memory registers contain the actual sequence of instructions.
			These instructions are sent to the control bus and fed to the ALU.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="fetch_execute_cycle">
		<h3>Fetch-execute Cycle</h3>
		<p>
			Seeing all of these buses, we might wonder: How on earth do all of
			these components work together? How do they stay in sync? The answer
			is through the computer's <b>fetch-execute cycle</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As labyrinthine as it may be, the complexity is greatly reduced by a
			fundamental limitation in computing: A single processor &mdash; a
			chip consisting of one ALU, PC, and a few registers &mdash; can only
			execute one instruction at a time.<sup></sup> This isn't just some
			design choice; it's rooted in the very theory of computation that
			gives us computers in the first place. Computer systems, at their
			core, are extremely limited Turing machines. Because Turing machines
			have infinite memory, the operations a computer system can perform
			are a subset of the Turing machine's operations. Thus, if some
			operation is outside the Turing machine's set of operations &mdash;
			i.e., the Turing machine cannot perform it &mdash; that operation is
			outside the computer system's set of operations as well. There are
			several such operations, one of which is executing more than one
			instruction at a single point in time.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Note that we're not talking about multicore or parallel processors.
				We'll discuss those in later sections. We're only talking about the
				single, simple processor we've been working with.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Because of this limitation, computer systems operate by following a
			specific schedule called the <b>fetch-execute cycle</b>. The
			fetch-execute cycle is a very simple schedule:
		</p>
		<div id="fetch_execute_1"></div>
		<p>
			At any given moment in time, the CPU is doing one of these two things
			&mdash; fetching an instruction from program memory, or executing an
			instruction. Fetch, execute, fetch, execute, fetch, execute &hellip;
			that's all a CPU knows, and that's all it does. How does the CPU know
			when to fetch and execute? To answer this question, let's take a
			closer look at the CPU.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="cpu">
		<h3>The CPU</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>CPU</b> (<i>Central Processing Unit</i>), or simply
			<i>processor</i>, is often characterized as the computer system's
			brain &mdash; it's where decisions are made. Like other chips in the
			computer system, the CPU is a chip composed of several chips: (1) the
			ALU, (2) a chip called the <b>control unit</b>, and (3) processor
			registers.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a chip, the CPU receives two inputs:
			<i>procedural data</i> (instructions, i.e., operations) and
			<i>substantive data</i> (the data the instructions operate on, i.e.,
			the operands). Once a CPU is given an instruction, it performs two
			functions:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Executing the received execution, and</li>
			<li>
				in the process of executing the received instruction, determines
				which instruction to execute next.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			To understand how it accomplishes this, let's consider the diagram of
			some very simple ${16}$-bit CPU:
		</p>
		<div id="cpu1"></div>
		<p>The table below describes each of these pins.</p>
		<table class="api">
			<thead>
				<th>Pin</th>
				<th>Bus</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><var>inM</var></td>
					<td>${16}$</td>
					<td>
						This input pin receives ${16}$-bit bitstream from data memory.
						This bitstream corresponds to the value inside the currently
						selected register. For example, if the currently selected
						register is <var>RAM[28]</var>, and <var>RAM[28]</var> contains
						the bits <var>01101010</var>, the bitstream
						<var>01101010</var> is fed through this pin.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>instruction</var></td>
					<td>${16}$</td>
					<td>
						This input pin receives a ${16}$-bit bitstream from the
						currently selected register in instruction memory. The
						bitstreams fed through this pin are the instructions the CPU
						must execute. For example, if the currently selected register
						in instruction memory is <var>RAM[762]</var>, and
						<var>RAM[762]</var> contains some instruction
						<var>1001011</var>, the bitstream <var>1001011</var> is fed
						through this pin.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>reset</var></td>
					<td>${1}$</td>
					<td>
						This input pin receives exactly one bit, called the
						<b>reset bit</b>, directly from the user. We'll discuss what
						this bit does in a later section.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>outM</var>, <var>writeM</var>, <var>addressM</var></td>
					<td>${16,~1,~15}$</td>
					<td>
						The CPU's output pins are best understood together. As we'll
						see later, every instruction in the computer system is
						structured in such a way that it allows the CPU to determine
						whether or not to write to data memory. Thus, the substantive
						output of a CPU is a collection of three outputs:
						<var>outM</var>, which consists of the data that must be stored
						in data memory (if any), <var>writeM</var>,
						<var>addressM</var> (which specifies which register to send the
						data to), and <var>writeM</var> (which toggles the register to
						store the data).
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><var>pc</var></td>
					<td>${15}$</td>
					<td>
						The <var>pc</var> pin outputs a stream of ${15}$ bits. These
						bits comprise the address of a register in instruction memory.
						That register contains the bits for the next instruction to be
						executed.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			Below is a graph of the CPU's internal components. The green nodes
			are the inputs; the red nodes are multiplexors; the blue nodes are
			significant chips; the yellow nodes are control bits; and the purple
			nodes are outputs.
		</p>
		<div id="cpu_internal"></div>
		<p>
			Although it seems like there's a lot to unpack here, in reality, the
			CPU is much simpler than it appears. For the next few sections, we'll
			steadily untangle the diagram above.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="decoding">
		<h3>Decoding</h3>
		<p>
			We begin by looking at the <var>instruction</var> pin. The diagram
			below presents a closer view of this particular part of the CPU:
		</p>
		<div id="instruction_handling"></div>
		<p>
			As mentioned earlier, the instruction pin receives a bitstream of
			machine language instructions. In the diagram, we use the instruction
			<var>0000 1011 1011 1001</var> as an example. For the CPU to
			understand what this instruction is, it must <b>decode</b> the
			instruction. How? By using the instruction's <i>opcode</i>:
		</p>
		<dvi id="a_instruction_cpu_input"></dvi>
		<p>
			The most significant bit (the <var>0</var> colored orange above) is
			the opcode that tells the CPU that this instruction is an
			A-instruction. Because of this opcode, the CPU knows to put the blue
			bits (a ${15}$ bit value) inside the A-register. Indeed, that's
			precisely what the gate does (ignore all of the other parts for now).
		</p>
		<p>
			So that's an A-instruction. What about a C-instruction? Recall that a
			C-instruction looks like:
		</p>
		<dvi id="c_instruction_cpu_input"></dvi>
		<p>
			The orange bit is the opcode, the blue bits are the ALU control bits,
			the red bits are the destination load bits, and the red bits are the
			jump bits. These are the four different fields the CPU must decode
			the instruction into.
		</p>
		<p>
			The C-instruction is precisely why we feed instructions into a Mux16
			rather than just straight into an A-register. A-instructions are
			simple &mdash; they go straight to the A-register. C-instructions,
			however, require computations from the ALU. In that situation, the
			instruction must pass from the A-register to the ALU, then from the
			ALU back to the Mux16. And to toggle the Mux16 to receive the ALU
			output, a control bit is passed to the Mux16.
		</p>
		<p>
			So now we know how the CPU receives instructions. Let's look at the
			ALU:
		</p>
		<div id="alu_internal"></div>
		<p>
			Examining the ALU, we see that there are inputs coming from three
			different sources. A stream of control bits (the blue bits in the
			C-instruction), a bitstream from the D-register, or a bitstream from
			a Mux16. That Mux16 outputs either a bitstream from the A-register,
			or the input bitstream <var>inM</var>. Which bitstream the Mux16
			outputs is determined by one of the bits in the instruction.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ALU's outputs are fanned out to three different pins: (1) The
			D-register, (2) the A-register, and (3) the output pin
			<var>outM</var>. That does not necessarily mean that the ALU's output
			<i>will</i> be kept at those destinations. Whether the D-register
			accepts the output is determined by the control bit it receives.
			Whether the A-register accepts the output is determined by the
			control bit it receives. And whether <var>outM</var> accepts the
			output is determined by the control bit it receives.
		</p>
		<p>
			These control bits are provided by the instruction's
			<b>destination bits</b> &mdash; the red bits in the C-instruction:
		</p>
		<dvi id="c_instruction_cpu_input2"></dvi>
		<p>
			The first red bit is the control bit for the A-register. The second
			red bit is the control bit for the D-register. And the third control
			bit is corresponds to <var>writeM</var>, which determines whether
			<var>outM</var> accepts the ALU's output.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="control_unit">
		<h3>Control Unit</h3>
		<p>
			There's one output from the ALU we didn't address in the previous
			section &mdash; the control bit output. Recalling the ALU section, we
			saw that there were two output bits called <var>zr</var> and
			<var>ng</var>. These output bits indicate if the result of the last
			computation was zero (<var>zr</var>) or negative <var>(ng)</var>.
			These bits are used by the <b>control unit</b>, a collection of chips
			that includes the program counter:
		</p>
		<div id="control_unit_internal"></div>
		<p>
			At this point, we can now address the <var>reset</var> bit. The
			<var>reset</var> bit is what's sent when we push the power button on
			a computer system. That power button is better thought of as a
			<i>reset button</i>. The computer system has a built in program
			&mdash; we can think of it as being burned into ROM &mdash; that
			automatically runs when the reset button is pushed. We'll discuss the
			details at great length in a later section, but for now, we'll leave
			it at that.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, the control unit. Let's say we passed the following instruction:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ \texttt{111~acccccc~ddd~jjj} $$</figure>
		<p>
			Obviously, this is not in binary. We're using letters for the sake of
			illustration; every place in the bitstream is really a
			<var>1</var> or <var>0</var>. From our simple machine language, we
			knowt that he <var>1</var> indicates that this is a control
			instruction.
		</p>
		<p>
			And as we know, the last three bits &mdash; the <var>jjj</var> abovea
			&mdash; are the <i>jump bits</i>. If the jump bits are all
			<var>0</var>, then no jumping occurs. If the jump bits are all
			<var>1</var>, then we have an unconditional jump. Any other
			combination of zeroes and ones corresponds to a conditional jump.
			That's the specification. The question then, is, how do we implement
			this specification in hardware terms? That is, how does the CPU
			<i>know</i> which bit sequence means what? The answer is through the
			<b>program counter (PC)</b>, the chip at the very heart of the
			control unit.
		</p>
		<p>
			The PC's principle responsibility is to always output the address of
			thec register containing the next instruction. To implement this
			property, we begin by using the following specifications:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The program counter, denoted <var>PC</var>, always contains some
				value. Accordingly, it is a kind of register.
			</li>
			<li>
				To start or restart the program's execution, the program counter is
				set to <var>0</var>: <var><mark>PC=0</mark></var
				>. Thus, before a program begins executing, <var>PC=0</var>.
			</li>
			<li>
				To execute the program's first instruction, we increment the
				programv counter: <var><mark>PC++</mark></var
				>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the jump bits are all <var>0</var> (no jump instructions), we
				continue incrementing: <var>PC++</var>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If all the jump bits are <var>1</var> (unconditional jump), then we
				set <var>PC</var> to the contents of the A-register:
				<var><mark>PC=A</mark></var
				>.<sup></sup>
			</li>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					This particular specification rests on the assumption that the
					programmer knows what their doing &mdash; they've ensured that
					the instruction they want executed again has been placed in the
					A-register.
				</p>
			</div>
			<li>
				If some of the jump bits are <var>1</var> and others <var>0</var>,
				then there is a conditional jump &mdash;
				<var><mark>PC=A else PC++</mark></var
				>.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="information">
	<h2>What is information?</h2>
	<p>
		We begin by reviewing the concept of <b>information</b> &mdash;
		knowledge communicated or perceived about a particular fact or
		circumstance. In the computer science context, information is
		processed, organized, or structured data.<sup></sup> That data is a
		resolution of uncertainty &mdash; it answers the
		<i>declarative question</i>: <q>What is ${x?}$</q> where ${x}$ is some
		subject. That subject, ${x,}$ could be anything: The location of the
		closest coffee shop, the likelihood of two individuals forming a
		relationship, or more generally, the answer to a particular question
		${q,}$ and so on.
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			This is a key difference between <i>data</i> and <i>information</i>.
			Data can be a collection of redundant or meaningless symbols, but
			information is organized data that resolves certainty.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		The less predictable the answer to the declarative question is, the
		more information the answer conveys. This is implied by the fact that
		information is a resolution of uncertainty. Let's say the amount of
		information needed to convey a low probability event A is ${A_I.}$ Then
		let's say the amount of information needed to convey a high probability
		event ${B}$ is ${B_I.}$ It follows that ${A_I &gt; B_I,}$ since ${A}$
		is a more surprising event than ${B.}$ More generally, the more
		uncertain, rare, or surprising-if-it-occurs an event is, the more
		information is needed to represent that particular event.
	</p>
	<p>
		How do we represent this information? One way to do so is with
		<i>bits</i>. Say we had a switch for a lighbulb that goes on or off.
		The switch has ${2}$ possible states &mdash; ${0}$ or ${1.}$ If we
		lined up two of these switches and interpreted them as a unit, we would
		have ${4}$ possible states. In general, if we had ${N}$ switches lined
		up, we would have ${2^N}$ possible states. This in turn means that with
		${N}$ switches, we have ${\log_{2}2^N = N}$ bits at our disposal.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can calculate the amount of information there is in an event ${x}$
		using the probability of the event ${x}$:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \text{information}(x) = - \log_2 (~p(x)~) $$
		<figcaption>
			where ${x}$ is some event, and ${p(x)}$ is the probability of ${x.}$
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Suppose you're faced with ${n}$ equally probably choices, and our
		friend Jihei tells us a fact ${x}$ that narrows it down to ${m}$
		possible choices. The fact ${x}$ consists of ${I(x)}$ information:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} I(n) - I(x) &= I(m) \\ I(n) &= I(m) + I(x) \\ I(n) -
		I(m) &= I(x) \\ \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, Jihei gave us:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} I(x) &= I(n) - I(m) \\[1em] &= \log_{2} \left(
		\dfrac{n}{m} \right) \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>bits of information. The amount of information in one coin flip:</p>
	<figure>$$ I(f) = \log_{2} \left( \dfrac{2}{1} \right) $$</figure>
	<p>which is ${1}$ bit of information. The roll of ${2}$ dice:</p>
	<figure>$$ I(d) = \log_{2} \left( \dfrac{36}{1} \right) $$</figure>
	<p>
		which is ${5.2}$ bits. Once we have an idea about how many bits are
		needed, we need to <b>encode</b>. <i>Encoding</i> is the process of
		assigning representations to information. Choosing an appropriate and
		efficient encoding is a real engineering challenge. There numerous
		factors to consider:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Mechanism</i> &mdash; The more mechanisms the process contains,
			the more complex the encoding is, and more difficult it is to improve
			or modify in the future. Too little mechanisms, and we start limiting
			the encodings functionality.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Efficiency</i> &mdash; The number of bits used. We want the
			minimal about of bits as possible to represent as much information as
			possible. Too few bits, the less information we can represent.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Reliability</i> &mdash; We want little to no <i>noise</i>.
			Essentially, the reliability of the encoding in a variety of
			environments. We do not want the encoding breaking down when it's
			suddenly fed different types of information.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Security</i> &mdash; The key issue here is <i>encryption</i>. We
			want the encoding to have maximal security.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If all the choices are equally likely, a simple way to encode is
		<b>fixed-length encoding</b>. For example, with the decimal digits,
		there are ${10}$ possible choices:
	</p>
	$$ \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \} $$
	<p>Since we have ${10}$ possible choices, we need:</p>
	<figure>$$ \log_{2}(10) \approx 3.322 $$</figure>
	<p>bits. Thus, to encode the ${10}$ digits, need ${4}$ bits.</p>
	<p>
		For the standard English characters &mdash; uppercase letters (${26}$),
		lowercase letters (${26}$), decimal digits (${10}$), punctuation
		(${11}$), math (${9}$), finance symbols (${4}$) &mdash; there are
		roughly ${86}$ possible choices. Thus, we need:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \log_{2}(86) \approx 6.426 $$</figure>
	<p>
		bits. Accordingly, we need ${7}$ bits to represent the possible
		choices. Hence the name, <i>7-bit ASCII</i>.

<section id="6502_processor">
	<h2>Overview of the 6502</h2>
	<p>
		Below is a pinout diagram of the 6502 processor. Let's go over some of
		the key features of the pinout.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Every processor manufacturer provides a manual usually called
			<i>Programmer's Environment Manual.</i> These are more generally
			called <b>data books</b>, and they're what they sound like &mdash; a
			manual for working with the processor directly.

	<p>
		First, all of the pins above have specific purposes that we'll go over
		in due time. For example, pin 1 is labeled <var>RDY</var>. This is the
		<b>ready pin</b>. It receives signals &mdash; called
		<i>ready signals</i> &mdash; indicating that something has happened
		(e.g., the television set is ready, the joystick is ready, etc.). At
		pin 4, there's a label ${\overline{\texttt{IRQ}}.}$ This pin receives
		<b>interruption requests</b>. Working with assembly, we'll be turning
		back to this diagram repeatedly for reference.
	</p>
	<p>
		Importantly, there are two large swathes of pins called the
		<b>address bus</b> and the <b>data bus</b>. Notice that the data bus
		region consists of eight pins. This corresponds to the fact that there
		<em>${8}$ bits</em> for the data bus. These eight bits are responsible
		for moving values to and from the <b>processor registers</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What are processor registers? We can think of them as small places
		inside the processor that store bits &mdash; zeroes and ones. On the
		2600, each register in the processor can only hold eight bits at any
		given time. These days, most machines run on 64-bit processors &mdash;
		processors whose registers can hold sixty-four bits.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the data bus, we have a region called the
		<b>address bus</b>. The pins comprising the address bus are responsible
		for storing <b>memory addresses</b>. We can think of them as trackers.
		They're job is to always know where things are at any given time.
		Notice that there are 16 pins. This is why the 2600 has ${16}$ bits
		&mdash; ${2}$ bytes &mdash; to store a memory address.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, that's the 6502. What about the 6507? Well, the 6507 is essentially
		the 6502 with just a few differences: (1) The pins <var>A13</var>,
		<var>A14</var>, <var>A15</var>, and a few interruption lines are
		inaccessible.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 6507 processes ${1.19}$ million instructions per second. We can
		think of this as though the CPU were a clock, ticking ${1.19}$ million
		times per second. In fact, that analogy wouldn't be too far off &mdash;
		formally, each
		<q>tick</q> is called a <b>clock cycle</b>.
	</p>
	<p>We will explore the processor more deeply in a later section.</p>

<section id="numbers">
	<h2>Numbers</h2>
	<p>
		Before we examine assembly code, it's worth quickly reviewing how
		information is represented in a computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		We've heard time and time again &mdash; computers only understand ones
		and zeroes. Now that we're working at such a low level, it's worth
		asking, do they actually? It turns out no. They do not. The ones and
		zeroes are just abstractions to aid in representing a binary system
		&mdash; on or off, yes or no, true or false, <i>one</i> or <i>zero</i>.
		What a computer really understands is just that &mdash; two opposite
		states. Or more concretely, two opposite <i>impulses</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The impulses can come in a variety of forms. Sometimes, they're
		electric impulses: In the processor, we have a
		<i>low voltage</i> or a <i>high voltage</i>. In other cases, they're
		light impulses: On a CD, the impulses are generated by lasers. If the
		laser's light bounces off of the CD, we have a ${1,}$ if it does not,
		we have a ${0.}$ And yet in others, they're magnetic: On a hard disk
		drive, if the driver's lever is magnetically attracted to some area of
		the disk, we have a ${0,}$ and if it's magnetically repelled, we have a
		${1.}$ We call the abstractions of ${1}$ and ${0}$ <b>bits</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, how do numbers come in? Well, thanks to some very clever
		electrical engineers, we can group bits together. The ability to group
		bits together is what allows us to represent the many numbers we work
		with on a daily basis.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="registers">
	<h2>Overview: CPU</h2>
	<p>
		The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a machine for executing programs.
		The two key aspects of the CPU are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>registers, and</li>
		<li>instructions</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We can think of registers as variables. For example, on the 8080
		processor, we have five ${8}$-bit registers. From a ${C}$ perspective,
		we can think of those registers as:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-c"><code>
		unsigned char A;
		unsigned char B;
		unsigned char C;
		unsigned char D;
		unsigned char E;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Every processor has a component called the <b>program counter (PC)</b>,
		which we can think of as a pointer:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-c"><code>
		unsigned char A;
		unsigned char B;
		unsigned char C;
		unsigned char D;
		unsigned char E;

		unsigned char* PC;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		For the CPU, program instructions are hexadecimal numbers, and a
		program is just a sequence of hexadecimal numbers. Each assembly
		language instruction corresponds to ${1}$ to ${3}$ bytes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 6507 processor uses a 28-pin configuration, running at ${1.19
		\text{MHz},}$ or <q>ticking</q> at ${1.19}$ million times per second
		(each tick is called a <b>clock cycle</b>). There are ${13}$ address
		pins and ${8}$ data pins. This means there are ${8}$ bits for data, and
		${13}$ bits for addressing. This totals ${21}$ pins. What about the
		other ${7}$ pins? They're used for the CPU's power, timing clock, rest,
		request bus wait states (e.g., the RDY pin), and read/write commands to
		memory from the CPU (these pins determine whether we're reading or
		writing to memory at any given moment).
	</p>
	<p>
		Importantly, unlike the 6502, we don't get IRQ (interruption request)
		or NMI (non-maskable interrupt) pins. Because these pins are
		unavailable, we cannot perform interrupts on the Atari 2600. This isn't
		pertinent at the moment, but we mention it now to clarify the
		differences between the 6507 and 6502.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are seven main parts to both the 6502 and 6507 processor. A rough
		diagram of the processor is as follows:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/CPU.svg' %}"
			alt="6502 processor"
			loading="lazy"
			width="300px"
			height="300px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The dark area above is the processor &mdash; it communicates with both
		the data bus and the address bus. The data bus transfers data to and
		from memory, while the address bus passes an address, sent from the
		CPU, to the ram &mdash; memory.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also have a component called the <b>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</b>.
		It goes without saying that the processor must perform basic
		computations &mdash; addition, subtraction, determining whether a value
		is less than, greater than, or equal to another, as well as the logical
		deductions from logical operations like AND and OR. Thes are the core
		arithmetic and logical computations, and the ALU, which resides in the
		processor, is responsible for them.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			More accurately, the ALU only performs bitwise operations on integer
			binary numbers. The notion of arithmetic and logic are simply
			abstractions for the ALU's manipulation of zeroes and ones.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Next, we have the <b>registers</b>. The 6502 has six addressable
		registers. These registers are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The <b>program counter (PC)</b>, which is responsible for storing the
			address of the next instruction that must be executed. For example,
			if one of our instructions is to load the integer <var>2</var> in
			memory, that instruction will have an address, stored by the PC
			register.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>stack pointer (SP)</b>, which points to the top of the
			<i>stack</i>. We've heard of the stack and the heap often; the stack
			pointer always holds the memory address of the current top-most frame
			in the RAM's stack memory.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>processor flag register (P)</b> is responsible for storing
			data about what happened in the processor's last execution. For
			example, whether the last computation resulted in an overflow,
			returned negative, or zero.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>X, Y, & A (Accumulator) Registers.</b> These three registers are
			essentially general-purpose registers. We can use them to store any
			kind of value to make our lives easier. For example, these registers
			can be used to keep track of some loop-counter. The accumulator
			register in particular is what we must use if we want to perform
			computations with the ALU.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Because the 6507/6502 is an 8-bit processor, each of the registers
		consists of <em>eight bits</em>. There are, however, two registers that
		are slighly different &mdash; the stack pointer and program counter.
		Because these two registers must keep track of memory addresses, the
		stack pointer and the program counter require ${16}$ bits.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, the processor status register (the <i>P register</i>), has the
		following layout for its eight bits:
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<ol class="array">
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>n</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>v</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>&ThickSpace;</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>b</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>d</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>i</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>z</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>c</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		The <b>c</b> flag stands for <b>carry</b>. If that bit contains a
		<var>1</var>, then the last execution contained a carry.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>z</b> flag stands for <b>zero</b>. If that bit contains a
		<var>1</var>, then the last execution resulted in a zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>i</b> flag stands for <b>IRQ disabled</b>. If the bit is
		<var>1</var>, then the last execution disabled an interrup (i.e.,
		ignoring messages from some hardware). Note that we won't concern
		ourselves with this particular flag since we do not have interrupts.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>d</b> flag stands for <b>decimal mode</b>. This particular flag
		will be explored in a section on to itself. In short, the processor can
		perform its executions in either binary or in
		<i>binary-coded decimal</i> (BCD). Performing executions in BCD leads
		to more accurate computations, but it is much slower than performing
		executions in binary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>b</b> flag stands for <b>break instruction</b>. This flag
		indicates that the last execution was interrupted, per another
		instruction.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>v</b> flag stands for <b>overflow</b>. A <var>1</var> in this
		bit indicates that the last instruction resulted in an overflow. For
		example, adding two values that resulted in overflowing the ${8}$ bits
		available.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>n</b> flag stands for <b>negative</b>. A <var>1</var> in this
		bit indicates that the last execution's result was negative.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that there's one idle bit. It's unclear why this bit was left
		unused, but it's more than likely the result of a manufacturing
		decision after price negotiations.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="carry_flag">
	<h2>Processor Status Flags</h2>
	<p>
		Because of how useful processor flags are, we explore them a little
		more deeply. As we know, we only have eight bits to work with. Say we
		load the integer ${255}$ in memory. This results in:
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<ol class="array">
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>1</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		In other words, we're using all ${8}$ bits. Now say we add a ${1}$ to
		this number. In binary, if we add a ${1}$ to this number, we get the
		following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & & \\ & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &
		1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ + & & & & & & & & 1 \\ \hline 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
		0 & 0 & 0 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		We keep carrying over and over until we reach the last available bit.
		But what happens to that carryover bit? It gets sent to the
		<i>P register</i>'s <var>c</var> flag:
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<ol class="array">
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
					<li>n</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
					<li>v</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
					<li>b</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
					<li>d</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
					<li>i</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>0</li>
					<li>z</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="blueText">1</span></li>
					<li>c</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<p>
		This is what we mean by a <i>carry</i>, in terms of the processor
		flags. Before consider the other flags, we briefly detour into the
		issue of representing negative numbers in a computer.
	</p>

	<section id="negatives">
		<h3>Representing Negative Numbers</h3>
		<p>
			To represent numbers, computers begin with a foundational premise:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>All numbers are one of two states: positive or negative.</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Clearly, this departs from mathematics. We know zero is neither
			positive nor negative, and there are nonreal numbers, i.e., imaginary
			numbers. Computers, however, aren't that smart. They're fast, but
			they aren't Gausses or Eulers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of the premise above, one way to represent negative nubers is
			to reserve the last bit to represent the <i>sign</i> of a number.
			This bit is called the <b>sign bit</b>:
		</p>
		<div class="compare">
			<ol class="array">
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="redText">0</span></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<ul>
						<li>1</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			On most computers &mdash; the 6502/07 included &mdash; a
			<var>0</var> maps to a positive, and a <var>1</var> to a negative.
		</p>
		<p>
			As always, there's a cost to using the sign bit. Because we lose that
			bit, we now only have ${7}$ bits to work with. And given that we only
			have ${7}$ bits, we can only represent numbers in the range
			${(-2^7-1, 2^7-1).}$ In other words, ${-127}$ to ${127.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			This approach to negative number representation is called
			<b>sign-and-magnitude</b>. It is <em>not</em> how most computers
			represent negatives. The most obvious problem with this approach is
			that we end up with two values for zero:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \texttt{+0 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0} \\ \texttt{-0 = 1 0
			0 0 0 0 0 0} \\ \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Moreover, sign-and-magnitude is cumbersome to implement. Adding and
			subtracting, very basic operations, are needlessly tedious under this
			approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			A much better &mdash; and more clever &mdash; take is
			<b>two's complement</b>.
		</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="assembler_flow">
	<h2>The Assembler Flow</h2>
	<p>
		As we mentioned earlier, a program is nothing more than a sequence of
		hexadecimal numbers to the processor. Hexadecimal numbers, however, are
		difficult to write, so use an abstraction &mdash; assembly. Unlike
		other languages like C or Python, Assembly is about as low as we can
		get without having to write code strictly in numerals.
	</p>
	<p>
		But how does the processor understand Assembly instructions? For
		example, how do we tell the processor we want to load the value
		<var>2</var> into the A register? The idea is to send a sequence of
		bits:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \underbrace{\texttt{0101}}_{\normalsize
		\texttt{A}}~~\underbrace{\texttt{1001}}_{\normalsize
		\texttt{9}}~~\underbrace{\texttt{0000}~~
		\texttt{\textcolor{salmon}{0010}}}_{\normalsize 2} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		to the processor's pins. Above, the hexadecimal <var>A</var> is called
		an <b>operation code (opcode)</b> &mdash; a sequence of bits that the
		processor compares against its hardwired opcode table to determine
		which instruction it must execute. In this case, the processor
		determines the sequence as corresponding to <var>A9</var>,
	</p>
	<p>
		Because we're speaking directly with the processor, we have to remember
		a key fact &mdash; computers are remarkably stupid. They don't
		understand things like nuance and context, unless we define them. At
		higher levels, we might think that computers are quickly approaching
		the singularity, but nothing could be further from the truth.
		Processors cannot read our minds &mdash; we have to explicitly state
		the <em>exact</em> series of steps towards accomplishing a particular
		task.
