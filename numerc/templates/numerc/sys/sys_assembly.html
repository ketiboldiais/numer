<h1>Assembly</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		In this module, we examine some basic ideas in assembly language. This will
		provide much of the foundations for later discussions. To do so, we will use
		the <b>6502 Assembly Language</b>, as employed on the Atari 2600 (<q
			>the 2600</q
		>) platform. Such a simple platform is used for several reasons: (1) It
		allows us to avoid having to address the enormous stretches of complexity on
		modern devices, and (2) it captures most, if not all, of the most important
		ideas in assembly and computer architecture concisely.
	</p>
	<p>The Atari 2600's hardware at a glance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The 2600 uses a 6507 processor, running at ${1.19~\text{MHz}}$ (${1.19
			\times 10^6}$ instructions per second). Atari originally selected the 6502
			processor, but in production, the cheaper version, 6507, was used. Both
			architectures are similar, but we'll note a few differences as we proceed.
			Of note, the 6502 powered many computers: the Apple II, various Commodore
			machines, the Tamagotchi, NES, and Bender from <i>Futurama</i>.
		</li>
		<li>
			For audio and video, the 2600 uses a TIA (Television Interface Adapter)
			chip.
		</li>
		<li>
			In terms of RAM (<q>Read-Access Memory</q>), the 2600 employs a 6532 RIOT
			(<q>RAM Input Output Timer</q>) Chip, capable of storing &mdash; wait for
			it &mdash; 128 bytes. Yes, that's all we get.
		</li>
		<li>
			In terms of ROM (<q>Read-Only Memory,</q> i.e., the game catridge), we
			have ${4~\text{kB}}$ to work with. The ROM is where we will read our
			instructins from for the 2600's processor.
		</li>
		<li>
			For input, we're working with two controller ports, connecting some
			non-keyboard peripheral &mdash; e.g., a joystick.
		</li>
		<li>
			For output, the 2600 uses a <b>cathode-ray tube (CRT) television</b>. Note
			that <i>CRT TVs</i> are different from <i>CRT Monitors</i>. We're
			operating under the assumption of working with a CRT TV, not a CRT
			monitor.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We should now see why the Atari 2600 is an ideal medium for exploring
		assembly programming. We're working with extremely tight constraints: The
		processor can only do so much; audio and video have to be manually taken
		care of; the set of possible user inputs is small; and memory is
		unquestionably scarce.

	<h2>Overview of the 6502</h2>
	<p>
		Below is a pinout diagram of the 6502 processor. Let's go over some of the
		key features of the pinout.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, all of the pins above have specific purposes that we'll go over in
		due time. For example, pin 1 is labeled <var>RDY</var>. This is the
		<b>ready pin</b>. It receives signals &mdash; called
		<i>ready signals</i> &mdash; indicating that something has happened (e.g.,
		the television set is ready, the joystick is ready, etc.). At pin 4, there's
		a label ${\overline{\texttt{IRQ}}.}$ This pin receives
		<b>interruption requests</b>. Working with assembly, we'll be turning back
		to this diagram repeatedly for reference.
	</p>
	<p>
		Importantly, there are two large swathes of pins called the
		<b>address bus</b> and the <b>data bus</b>. Notice that the data bus region
		consists of eight pins. This corresponds to the fact that there
		<em>${8}$ bits</em> for the data bus. These eight bits are responsible for
		moving values to and from the <b>processor registers</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What are processor registers? We can think of them as small places inside
		the processor that store bits &mdash; zeroes and ones. On the 2600, each
		register in the processor can only hold eight bits at any given time. These
		days, most machines run on 64-bit processors &mdash; processors whose
		registers can hold sixty-four bits.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the data bus, we have a region called the <b>address bus</b>.
		The pins comprising the address bus are responsible for storing
		<b>memory addresses</b>. We can think of them as trackers. They're job is to
		always know where things are at any given time. Notice that there are 16
		pins. This is why the 2600 has ${16}$ bits &mdash; ${2}$ bytes &mdash; to
		store a memory address.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, that's the 6502. What about the 6507? Well, the 6507 is essentially the
		6502 with just a few differences: (1) The pins <var>A13</var>,
		<var>A14</var>, <var>A15</var>, and a few interruption lines are
		inaccessible.

	<h2>Numbers</h2>
	<p>
		Before we examine assembly code, it's worth quickly reviewing how
		information is represented in a computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		We've heard time and time again &mdash; computers only understand ones and
		zeroes. Now that we're working at such a low level, it's worth asking, do
		they actually? It turns out no. They do not. The ones and zeroes are just
		abstractions to aid in representing a binary system &mdash; on or off, yes
		or no, true or false, <i>one</i> or <i>zero</i>. What a computer really
		understands is just that &mdash; two opposite states. Or more concretely,
		two opposite <i>impulses</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The impulses can come in a variety of forms. Sometimes, they're electric
		impulses: In the processor, we have a
		<i>low voltage</i> or a <i>high voltage</i>. In other cases, they're light
		impulses: On a CD, the impulses are generated by lasers. If the laser's
		light bounces off of the CD, we have a ${1,}$ if it does not, we have a
		${0.}$ And yet in others, they're magnetic: On a hard disk drive, if the
		driver's lever is magnetically attracted to some area of the disk, we have a
		${0,}$ and if it's magnetically repelled, we have a ${1.}$ We call the
		abstractions of ${1}$ and ${0}$ <b>bits</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, how do numbers come in? Well, thanks to some very clever electrical
		engineers, we can group bits together. The ability to group bits together is what allows us to
