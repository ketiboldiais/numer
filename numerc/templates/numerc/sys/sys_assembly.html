<section id="intro">
	<p>
		In this module, we examine some basic ideas in assembly language. This will
		provide much of the foundations for later discussions. To do so, we will use
		the <b>6502 Assembly Language</b>, as employed on the Atari 2600 platform.
		Such a simple platform is used for several reasons: (1) It allows us to
		avoid having to address the enormous stretches of complexity on modern
		devices, and (2) it captures most, if not all, of the most important ideas
		in assembly and computer architecture concisely.
