<h1>Lambda Calculus</h1>
<section id="lambda_calculus">
	<p>
		A <b>calculus</b> is a method of calculation or reasoning.
		<b>Lambda calculus</b> is one such calculus; it is a method of reasoning
		about <i>computation</i>. We start with the bedrock concept for this method
		of reasoning&mdash;the <b>function</b>. In functional programming, we rely
		on <i>only</i> functions. Programming functions are similar to mathematical
		functions, with a few key differences we will see later.
	</p>

	<p>
		Functional programs, at their core, are a combination of
		<span class="boldText">expressions</span>. An <i>expression</i> is a
		syntactic entity that can be evaluated to determine its value. For example,
		values, variables, and functions are all expressions. Some expressions are
		<b>reducible expressions</b> (commonly called <b>redex</b>) &mdash;
		expressions that can be broken down into smaller expressions. Others are in
		<b>normal form</b>, meaning they cannot be broken down any further.
	</p>

	<p>
		Functions, however, are a special kind of expression &mdash; they are
		expressions applied to an argument, or input, and once applied, can be
		<i>reduced</i> and <i>evaluated</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In functional programming languages like Haskell, functions are
		<b>first-class</b>: they can be used as values and passed as inputs, called
		<b>arguments</b>, to other functions. Haskell itself is the epitome of
		functional programming &mdash; it is a <b>pure functional language</b>. The
		word <i>pure</i> in computer science describes the level of a language's
		<b>referential transparency</b>. This is the property where, given a
		function, the function will always output the same result for the same
		inputs.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="functions">
	<h2>Functions</h2>
	<p>
		Mathematically, a function is a relation between a set of elements, called
		the <i>domain</i>, to another set of elements, called the <i>codomain</i>.
		Alternatively, from a computer science perspective: A function is a
		procedure that takes inputs and mapes those inputs to outputs. For example,
		addition can be seen as a function: it takes two inputs, and maps the two
		inputs to an output &mdash; the sum of the two inputs. Here is another
		example:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(0) \mapsto a}$</p>
			<p>${f(1) \mapsto b}$</p>
			<p>${f(2) \mapsto c}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		In the function ${f}$ above, the input set is ${\{ 1, 2, 3 \},}$ and the
		output set is ${\{ a, b, c \}.}$ A crucial point: The function ${f}$
		<span class="underlineText">will always</span> return exactly one output for
		one input, no exceptions. The core idea is: one output per input. The
		following is not a function:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${v(1) \mapsto x}$</p>
			<p>${v(1) \mapsto y}$</p>
			<p>${v(1) \mapsto z}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		This harkens back to the rule of referential transparency &mdash; given the
		same input, the output should be predictable. However, do not confuse the
		idea of one output per input with the idea one one
		<i>unique</i> output per input. The function ${f}$ might have a set of
		inputs, ${\{ 3, 4, 5 \},}$ that map to the same output ${d.}$ For example,
		the following is a function:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${h(1) \mapsto w}$</p>
			<p>${h(2) \mapsto w}$</p>
			<p>${h(3) \mapsto w}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		It is perfectly valid for a function's different inputs to return the same
		output. It is never valid for a function's input to return more than one
		output. The controlling question: Is the relationship predictable? To be
		predictable, every input must have one, and only one, output.
	</p>

	<p>
		The function itself defines the relationship between the inputs and the
		outputs. In the previous example, we gave no such relationship. When we
		explicitly provide that relationship, we
		<i>define</i> the function:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = x^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>If we pass the inputs ${\{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}:}$</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(1) \mapsto 1^2 = 1}$</p>
			<p>${f(2) \mapsto 2^2 = 4}$</p>
			<p>${f(3) \mapsto 3^2 = 9}$</p>
			<p>${f(4) \mapsto 4^2 = 16}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="lambda_terms">
	<h2>Lambda Terms</h2>
	<p>
		There are three basic components, called
		<b>lambda terms</b>, to a lambda function:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>expressions</i>,</li>
		<li><i>variables</i>, and</li>
		<li><i>abstractions</i></li>
	</ul>

	<section id="expressions">
		<h3>Expressions</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Expressions</b> is the superset of all the components &mdash;
			expressions, variables, and abstractions. The simplest expression is a
			single variable. A <b>variable</b> has no meaning or value; a variable is
			simply a name for potential inputs to functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			An <b>abstraction</b> is a function. The function itself has two
			components:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>a <i>head</i>, and</li>
			<li>a <i>body</i>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			A function's head is a lambda, ${\lambda,}$ followed by a variable name.
			The body of a function is another expression. Here is a simple function in
			lambda terms:
		</p>

		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\lambda x.x}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>

		<p>
			The variable named in the head, ${x,}$ is called the
			<i>parameter</i>. It <i>binds</i> all instances of ${x}$ in the function's
			body. Variables inside the body that are not bound in the head are called
			<b>free variables</b> (more on this later). What does <i>bind</i> mean? It
			means that when we pass an argument into the function, each ${x}$ in the
			function's body will have the value of the argument. Separating the head
			from the body is a dot.
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/lambda_terms.svg' %}"
				alt="lambda terms"
				class="twenty-p"
				loading="lazy"
			/>
		</figure>

		<p>
			When we write ${f(x) = x^2,}$ the function has a name &mdash; ${f.}$ We
			call such functions <b>named functions</b>. In contrast, the function
			${\lambda x.x}$ has no name; it is an <b>anonymous function</b>. The
			difference? We can call named functions by referencing its name, but we
			cannot do the same with anonymous functions.
		</p>
	</section>
</section>

<section id="alpha_equivalence">
	<h2>Alpha Equivalence</h2>
	<p>
		The variable ${x}$ has no meaning other than its role in a single
		expression. Because of this, the actual variable used is irrelevant when
		comparing functions similarly structured. For example, ${\lambda x.x}$ is
		the same function as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda a.a}$</p>
			<p>${\lambda g.g}$</p>
			<p>${\lambda w.w}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The functions above are all
		<i>alpha equivalent</i>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="beta_reduction">
	<h2>Beta Reduction</h2>
	<p>
		The expression we input to a function is called an <b>argument</b>. Once an
		argument is input to a function, the function is <i>applied</i> to the
		argument &mdash; all instances of the bound variables (the parameters) are
		substituted with the input expression inside the function's body. When these
		bound variables are substituted, they become bound to the input expression.
		Because they are now bound to the input expressions, the function's head is
		eliminated, since its only purpose was to bind a variable. We call this
		process <b>beta reduction</b>.
	</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>${\lambda x.x}$</li>
			<li>${\darr}$</li>
			<li>${(\lambda x.x) 2}$</li>
			<li>${\darr}$</li>
			<li>${2}$</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here, there is only one bound variable, ${x,}$ so applying the function to
		the input expression 2 returns 2. We call this the
		<b>identity function</b> &mdash; a function that consumes a single argument
		${x,}$ and returns the same argument ${x.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		In lambda calculus, we use parentheses to clarify the function's lambda
		terms. Here is another lambda function:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(\lambda x.x+1)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Passing the input expression 2:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>${(\lambda x.x+1) 2}$</li>
			<li>${\darr}$</li>
			<li>${2 + 1}$</li>
			<li>${\darr}$</li>
			<li>${3}$</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Beta reduction continues as long as there are (1) heads or (b) lambdas
		(i.e., abstractions). Once there are no more heads and no more lambdas, beta
		reduction ceases.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="lambda_abstractions">
	<h2>Abstractions as Arguments</h2>
	<p>We can also pass lambda abstractions as inputs:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we pass a lambda abstraction as an input, we substitute ${x}$ with the
		lambda abstraction, just as we would with numbers. We can denote this
		process with ${[x \coloneqq z,]}$ meaning, ${z}$ will substitute all
		occurrences of ${x.}$ In this case, ${z}$ is the abstraction ${\lambda
		y.y.}$ The beta reduction looks like:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{aligned} (\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y)& \\ [x \coloneqq (\lambda
		y.y)]& \\ \lambda y.y& \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="additional_arguments">
	<h2>Additional Arguments</h2>
	<p>A lambda abstraction can take additional arguments:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y)z}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		How do we reduce the lambda abstraction above? By following this rule:
		Applications are <span class="underlineText">left-associative</span>. This
		means, if there are no parentheses, then the abstractions group to the left.
		Thus, the abstraction above is evaluated as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${((\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y))z}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The beta reduction is thus:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{aligned} ((\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y))z& \\ [x \coloneqq (\lambda
		y.y)]& \\ (\lambda y.y)z& \\ [y \coloneqq z]& \\ z& \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="free_variables">
	<h2>Free Variables</h2>
	<p>
		The body of a function may sometimes contain a variable that is not defined
		in the function's head. For example, the general form of a logarithmic
		function:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${t(x) = \log_{b}(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The only variable defined in the head is ${x,}$ but ${b}$ is another
		variable, denoting the <i>base</i>. In lambda terms, we might have a
		function:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda x.xy}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As we briefly mentioned in a previous section, such variables &mdash; those
		not defined in the function's head &mdash; are called
		<i>free variables</i>. When we reduce the abstraction above, there is
		nothing we can do to the free variable ${y;}$ it is <b>irreducible</b>.
		Suppose we encountered the lambda abstraction ${(\lambda x.xy)z.}$ The beta
		reduction:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{aligned} (\lambda x.xy)z& \\ (\lambda[x \coloneqq z].xy)& \\ zy&
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		The second step in the reduction above merits careful attention. Since ${x}$
		is a bound variable, all instances of ${x}$ in the body are substituted with
		${z.}$ Hence the inclusion of ${[x \coloneqq z]}$ inside the function's
		head. Only then do we proceed to the third step, where we replace all
		instances of ${x}$ in the body with ${z,}$ and eliminate the head.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of note, the rule of alpha equivalence does not apply to lambdas with free
		variables. In other words, ${(\lambda x.xz)}$ is not equivalent to ${\lambda
		x.xy.}$ This is because ${z}$ and ${y}$ are not bound in the head, and as
		such, are both capable of meaning different things. If, however, we wrote
		${\lambda xz.xz}$ and ${\lambda xy.xy}$ (binding ${y}$ and ${z}$ in the
		function's head), then alpha equivalence applies, since ${y}$ and ${z}$ are
		no longer free variables. But, the lambdas ${\lambda x.xy}$ and ${\lambda
		z.zy}$ are alpha equivalent, because both lambdas leave the free variables
		alone.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="multiple_arguments">
	<h2>Multiple Arguments.</h2>
	<p>
		A lambda can bind one, and only one parameter, and can only accept one, and
		only one, argument. If a function requires multiple arguments, then its
		corresponding lambda must have
		<span class="underlineText">multiple and nested</span> heads. How are such
		lambdas evaluated? By eliminating the first (leftmost) head, then the next,
		then the next, etc. We call this process <b>currying</b>. Here is a lambda
		that represents a function consuming multiple arguments:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda x.(\lambda y.xy)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		As a matter of short-hand syntax, we write the lambda above more concisely
		as:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda xy.xy}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Do not confuse this short-hand syntax as implying a lambda whose head binds
		multiple parameters. The expression above should always be read as a lambda
		with multiple, nested heads: ${\lambda x(\lambda y.xy).}$ Now, when we
		evaluate the argument, we first bind ${x,}$ the variable bound by the
		outermost lambda. For example, suppose the lambda ${(\lambda xy.xy) 1 \space
		2}$ The beta reduction:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{aligned} (\lambda xy.xy) 1 \space \space 2& \\ (\lambda x (\lambda
		y.xy)) 1 \space \space 2& \\ [x \coloneqq 1]& \\ (\lambda y.1y) \space 2& \\
		[y \coloneqq 2]& \\ 1 \space \space 2& \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Here is another example:</p>

	<div class="mproof">
		<div class="premises">
			<ul>
				<li>${\lambda xy.xy}$</li>
				<li>the lambda</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>${a}$</li>
				<li>
					no ${z}$ in the body of the function, so there is nowhere to place 1;
					eliminate the head, and this is the final result
				</li>

<section id="normal_forms">
	<h2>Beta Normal Form.</h2>
	<p>
		The term
		<b>beta normal form</b> is a fancy word for when we cannot beta reduce the
		term any further. For example, the number 5 is the beta normal form of the
		term ${25,000/5,000.}$ We use the term "beta normal form" because there are
		different kinds of normal forms resulting from different kinds of reduction.
		In programming, beta normal form is exemplified through either (a)
		fully-evaluated expression or (b) a fully-executed program (this second
		point yields insight: in Haskell, a program is just another lambda
		function).
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a distinction between a term in normal form and a
		<b>saturated term</b>. The term ${10-5}$ is a saturated term (a term whose
		arguments have applied). There is a function, subtraction, and there are
		arguments applied &mdash; 10 and 5. But, ${10-5}$ is not fully-evaluated. It
		is saturated, but the normal form is 5.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="combinators">
	<h2>Combinators.</h2>
	<p>Consider the following lambda functions:</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda x.x}$</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda xy.x}$</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda xyz.xz(yz)}$</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		Notice that every term in the function's body also appears in the function's
		head. Each function above is called a
		<b>combinator</b> &mdash; a lambda term with no free variables. The
		functions above contrast from these functions:
	</p>

	<div class="compare">
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda y.x}$</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>${\lambda x.xz}$</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		These functions are no combinators, since they have
		<i>free variables</i>. In the first, ${y}$ is bound to the function's head,
		but ${x}$ is not. The same goes for the second function, ${x}$ is bound to
		the function's head, but ${z}$ is not.
