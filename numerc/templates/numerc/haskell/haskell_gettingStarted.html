<h1>Basic Data</h1>
<section id="start">
	<p>
		In this article, we'll learn the basic constructs for writing Haskell
		programs. This article assumes familiarity with at least 2 languages, so we
		will go through the constructs and common programming idioms fairly quickly.
		This is done for the sake of expediency; the interesting parts of Haskell
		aren't so much its syntax or lexicon, but what it can do and the ideas it
		represents.

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>
		The first step to using Haskell is to
		<a href="https://www.haskell.org/downloads/" target="_blank"
			>install the Haskell compiler</a
		>. Compiler installed, we'll create a new file called
		<span class="monoText">lab.hs</span>. As we can probably tell, Haskell files
		use the extension <span class="monoText">.hs</span>. To compile and execute
		<span class="monoText">main.hs</span>, we write in our terminal:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		ghc lab.hs
		./main
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Haskell also has a REPL called <span class="monoText">GHCi</span>. To use
		the REPL, we write:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		ghci
		Prelude> :l lab.hs
		*Main>
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This will load <span class="monoText">lab.hs</span> into the REPL, allowing
		us to use everything inside <span class="monoText">lab.hs</span>. To run
		<span class="monoText">lab.hs</span>, we will simply write:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		ghci
		Prelude> :l lab.hs
		*Main> :r
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As we can tell from these commands, <span class="monoText">:l</span> is an
		instruction to <span class="italicsText">load</span>
		<span class="monoText">lab.hs</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">:r</span> is an instruction to
		<span class="italicsText">run</span> <span class="monoText">lab.hs</span>.
	</p>

	<section id="comments">
		<p><span class="topic">Comments.</span> As with any other language, the first construct we should learn is how to comment. Haskell supports both single and multiline comments:</p>
		<pre class="language-haskell"><code>
			-- Single line comments are indicated with two dashes
			
			{-
				Multiline comments start with an 
				open curly-brace followed by a dash
				And end with a 
				dash followed by a closed curly-brace
			-}
		</code></pre>
