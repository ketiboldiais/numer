		<h3>Singletons</h3>
		<p>
			We can think of the singleton object as akin to the Federal Reserve.
			The Federal Reserve provides both money to banks. However, there's
			only so much money the Federal Reserve can give. It must make
			decisions about how much money to give, as well as keep track of how
			much money it's given out.
