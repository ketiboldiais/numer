<h1>Software Design</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		Unlike the others, this volume focuses more so on best practices in
		programming. Topics including approaches to naming, writing functions,
		classes, structures, and other data structures, as well as software design
		patterns in a variety of environments. As such, much of the topics covered
		here are language agnostic; they apply broadly to most programming
		languages.
	</p>
	<p>
		Computer science isn't just an academic discipline. It's also an applied
		field, and many of the topics we learn are intended to solve real-world
		problems. Coming up with a solution, however, is only half the battle. There
		is still the aspect of implementation, and as with any other problem-solving
		discipline, there are guidelines we can follow to make both ours, and
		others', lives easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		Software design practices are often domain-specific. Whether that domain is
		a language, a problem, or a data model, some practices are more readily
		applied in one situation over the next. Accordingly, the ability to spot and
		remedy implementation issues is a skill in itself. That ability is bolstered
		by examining what some domains identify to be issues and their approaches to
		resolution. These materials intend to provide that examination &mdash; we
		present common bad practices in a given domain and provide various
		approaches to correcting such habits.
	</p>
	<p>
		We emphasize that the the materials here are purely guidelines and tips. In
		essence, advice. And as with any advice, it is always at our discretion
		whether to heed or reject. As we work through a problem, we might learn that
		the guideline we're following is a poor choice, more cumbersome than for
		what it's worth, or simply without benefit. Nevertheless, it can help to
		have some starting point, from which better ideas ensue.
