<h1>Naming</h1>
<section id="naming">
	<p>
		Naming is arguably one of the most difficult aspects of programming. Despite
		the millions of words at our disposal, we are often at a loss for words.
		This &#8220;naming block&#8221; can cause us to stall. If we're stalling to
		come up with name, then we're in a good place. It indicates that we're aware
		of how important and valuable naming is. In general, these are the three
		core principles to naming:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ul>
				<li>A name should be descriptive of the entity named.</li>
				<li>A name should be concise.</li>
				<li>
					A name should descriptive and concise, erring on the side of
					descriptive.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Naming depends on the entity so named. We explore each in turn.</p>

	<h2>Naming Variables Storing Literals</h2>
	<p>
		The name of a variable that stores a literal should answer a very specific
		question:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ul>
				<li>What literal does the variable store?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If the variable stores a value with a unit of measurement, we should
		indicate that unit of measurement in the name. For example, if we're storing
		a temperature literal, we could simply write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			double temperature = 90;
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>However, a more readable name would be:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
		double temperature_in_fahrenheit = 90;
	</code></pre>
	</figure>
</section>
<section id="naming_variables_arrays">
	<h2>Naming Lists</h2>
	<p>A list's name should answer the following question:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ul>
				<li>Is this a list?</li>
				<li>What kinds of things are in the list?</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>For example, suppose we have a list of students. We could just write:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			string students = ["Amy", "Luke", "Ryan", "Yuna", "Maya"]
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>The name <span class="monoText">students</span>, however, could be any data structure. It could be a list, set, structure, or tree. We don't know just from looking at <span class="monoText">students</span>. A more descriptive name would be any of the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			string list_of_students = ["Amy", "Luke", "Ryan", "Yuna", "Maya"]
			string studentList = ["Amy", "Luke", "Ryan", "Yuna", "Maya"]
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>If all of the students have some common property, we can be even more descriptive:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<pre class="language-pseudo"><code>
			string list_of_students_who_attended = ["Amy", "Luke", "Ryan", "Yuna", "Maya"]
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>The name is longer, but remember: We err on the side of descriptive.</p>
