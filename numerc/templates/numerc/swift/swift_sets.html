	<h4>Sets</h4>
	<p>
		Sets are another native data structure provided by Swift. A
		<span class="term">set</span> is an unordered collection of
		<span class="italicsText">unique</span> values of the
		<span class="italicsText">same type</span>. This is similar to a
		mathematical set, but with the obvious differences being (1) the set's
		members must be unique (i.e., there are no duplicate values), and (2) the
		set's members must all be the same type. For example, we might have a set
		positive integers: ${\{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}.}$ To create a set in Swift, we use
		the following syntax:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>var ${S}$: Set<${t_v}$> = [</li>
			<ul>
				<li>${v_0}$</li>
				<li>${\vdots}$</li>
				<li>${v_n}$</li>
			</ul>
			<li>]</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the syntax above, ${S}$ is the name of the set, and
		<span class="monoText">Set<${t_v}$></span> is the data type. Unlike arrays
		and dictionaries, Swift cannot perform type inference on sets, so we must
		explicitly state the data type for each member in the set, ${t_v.}$ So long
		as we do so, initializing the set uses the same square bracket syntax used
		in initializing an array or dictionary. Here are some useful operations on
		sets:
	</p>

	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>operator</th>
				<th>operation</th>
				<th>comment</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="redText monoText">${S}$.contains(${v}$)</span></td>
					<td>Checks whether the value ${v}$ is inside the set ${S.}$</td>
					<td>
						Return type is a Bool. If ${v \in S,}$ return true. If ${v \notin
						S,}$ return false.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="redText">${S}$.insert(${v}$)</span></td>
					<td>Inserts the value ${v}$ into the set ${S.}$</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="redText">${S}$.remove(${v}$)</span></td>
					<td>Removes the value ${v}$ into the set ${S.}$</td>
					<td>
						Return type is an Optional<${t_v}$>(${v}$) where ${t_v}$ is type of
						the member removed; removing an element not inside the set returns
						<span class="underlineText">nil</span>; must unwrap before use
					</td>
				</tr>

		<span class="topic">Set Algebra.</span> Sets in Swift are a powerful data
		structure compared to other languages. For starters, Swift sets come with
		set algebra operations. This is a very useful feature not often natively
		provided by other languages. For example, suppose we have the following
		sets:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 15, 29, 20 \}}$</p>
			<p>${B = \{ 1, 8, 7, 29, 10, 3, 47, 19 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What is ${A \cap B?}$ We can answer this question in Swift with the
		following:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var A: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 15, 29, 20]
		var B: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [1, 8, 7, 29, 10, 3, 47, 19]
		
		var AintersectionB = A.intersection(B)
		print(AintersectionB)
		print(type(of: AintersectionB))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		[10, 1, 3, 29]
		Set&lt;Int&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Swift determined that ${A \cap B}$ is ${\{ 10, 1, 3, 29 \}}$ &mdash; the
		elements common to both sets ${A}$ and ${B.}$ We can also see that the
		return type is a set of type <span class="monoText">Int</span>. Suppose we
		have the following sets:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}}$</p>
			<p>${B = \{ 1, 2, 3, 5 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		What is the set difference, ${A \setminus B?}$ (this is the set of all
		elements that are not in both ${A}$ and ${B}$). We can compute this in Swift
		with:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var A: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [1, 2, 3, 4]
		var B: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [1, 2, 3, 5]
		
		var AminusB = A.symmetricDifference(B)
		print(AminusB)
		print(type(of: AminusB))	
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		[5, 4]
		Set&lt;Int&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>Finally, suppose we have the following sets:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$</p>
			<p>${B = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		What is ${A \cup B?}$ (This is the set of all elements in ${A}$ and all the
		elements in ${B}$). We can compute this in Swift with the following:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var A: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [0, 1, 2, 3]
		var B: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [-3, -2, -1, 0]
		
		var AunionB = A.union(B)
		print(AunionB)
		print(type(of: AunionB))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		[-1, 1, -2, 0, -3, 3, 2]
		Set&lt;Int&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice that the <span class="monoText">0</span> does not appear twice. This
		is because sets in Swift do not contain any duplicate values. In all of the
		operations above, the return was a new set. The sets passed as arguments are
		not mutated. Swift provides separate methods for mutating the relevant sets.
		For example, suppose we had the sets:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$</p>
			<p>${B = \{ 4, 5, 6 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can merge these sets together with:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var A: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [1, 2, 3]
		var B: Set&lt;Int&gt; = [4, 5, 6]

		A.formUnion(B)

		print(A)
		print(B)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		[5, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2]
		[5, 6, 4]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice that set <span class="monoText">A</span> was mutated, and set
		<span class="monoText">B</span> was not mutated. This tells us that only the
		method we call the method on will be mutated.
