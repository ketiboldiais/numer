	<h3>Classes</h3>
	<p>
		A <span class="monoText">class</span> in Swift is a reference type. This can
		have significant impact on how we write code. For example. Suppose we had
		the following structure:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the code above, we have a structure called
		<span class="monoText">fooStruct</span>, with two properties:
		<span class="monoText">a</span>, which takes an
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>, and <span class="monoText">b</span>,
		which takes an array of strings. Then, we created an instance of
		<span class="monoText">fooStruct</span> called
		<span class="monoText">baz</span>.
	</p>

	<p>Now suppose we want to add another string to the array. No problem:</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		baz.b.append("b")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Next, we assign <span class="monoText">baz</span> to another variable name,
		<span class="monoText">zing</span>. Then, using
		<span class="monoText">zing</span>, we append the string
		<span class="monoText">"c"</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		var zing = baz
		zing.b.append("c")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Let's then go back to the structure and add a method that appends a string
		to the array stored in field <span class="monoText">b</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []

			mutating func insertStr(newString: String) {
				b.append("Inserted: \(newString)")
			}
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		var zing = baz
		zing.b.append("c")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Now let's assign <span class="monoText">zing</span> to another variable,
		<span class="monoText">bang</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []

			mutating func insertStr(newString: String) {
				b.append("Inserted: \(newString)")
			}
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		var zing = baz
		zing.b.append("c")
		var bang = zing
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Finally, let's loop through each element in the field
		<span class="monoText">b</span> in <span class="monoText">bang</span>, and
		execute the <span class="monoText">insertStr()</span> method with the
		argument <span class="monoText">"!"</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []

			mutating func insertStr(newString: String) {
				b.append("Inserted: \(newString)")
			}
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		var zing = baz
		zing.b.append("c")
		var bang = zing
		for newString in bang.b {
			bang.insertStr(newString: "!")
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Finally, let's see what the values of <span class="monoText">baz.b</span>,
		<span class="monoText">zing.b</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">bang.b</span> are:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []

			mutating func insertStr(newString: String) {
				b.append("Inserted: \(newString)")
			}
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		var zing = baz
		zing.b.append("c")
		var bang = zing
		for newString in bang.b {
			bang.insertStr(newString: "!")
		}
		print(bang.b)
		print(zing.b)
		print(baz.b)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "b", "c", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !"]
		["a", "b", "c"]
		["a", "b"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		It seems as if only <span class="monoText">bang</span> was modified? Why?
		Because structures are a value type. Every instance of a structure is
		independent from other instances of the structure &mdash; modifications to
		one instance <span class="underlineText">will not</span> modify the other
		instances, even if that instance was the result of assigning another
		instance. When we assigned one instance variable to another variable, all we
		did was assign a <span class="italicsText">copy</span> of that instance. So,
		the modifications were made to the copy.
	</p>

	<p>
		This feature of structures comes directly from structures in languages like
		C. While it is a particularly useful feature in that we do not have to worry
		about mutability, it can be cumbersome when we
		<span class="italicsText">want</span> mutability, as is the case in
		object-oriented programming.
	</p>

	<p>
		To achieve this, we must use a <span class="term">class</span>. So, using
		the example above, we must first include a
		<span class="term">constructor</span>. This is because we cannot
		automatically generate an instance of a class. This is done with the
		<span class="monoText">init</span> symbol:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class fooStruct {
			let a: Int
			var b: [String] = []
			
			init(a: Int, b: [String]) {
				self.a = a
				self.b = b
			}
			
			func insertStr(newString: String) {
				b.append("Inserted: \(newString)")
			}
		}
		var baz = fooStruct(a: 0, b: ["a"])
		baz.b.append("b")
		var zing = baz
		zing.b.append("c")
		var bang = zing
		for _ in bang.b {
			bang.insertStr(newString: "!")
		}
		print(bang.b)
		print(zing.b)
		print(baz.b)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "b", "c", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !"]
		["a", "b", "c", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !"]
		["a", "b", "c", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !", "Inserted: !"]
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice how the original instance, <span class="monoText">baz</span>, was
		mutated as well. This is the critical difference between structures and
		classes.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="initializers">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Initializers.</span> In the previous section on
		inheritance, we saw errors appear if we failed to include an initial values
		for properties in subclasses. This is because Swift requires all stored
		properties to have initial values.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			var firstName: String
			var lastName: String
			init (firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.firstName = firstName
				self.lastName = lastName
			}
		}
		class Student: Person { // this line raises an error
			var school: String
		}
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String
		}
		
	</code></pre>
	<p>To fix the error above, we must include an initial value:</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			var firstName: String
			var lastName: String
			init (firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.firstName = firstName
				self.lastName = lastName
			}
		}
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String = ""
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In some situations, we might not want to include an initial value, but
		instead set the value ourselves. If this is the case, then we must write an
		initializer for the class. For example, maybe
		<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> should have its own initializer:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			var firstName: String
			var lastName: String
			init (firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.firstName = firstName
				self.lastName = lastName
			}
		}
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String
			
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String, major: String) {
				self.major = major
				super.init(firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName)
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice the line <span class="monoText">super.init()</span>. This will call
		the superclass's initializer, and initialize its values to the arguments
		passed. The order matters when writing a subclass's initializer. In this
		case, we first initialize <span class="monoText">major</span>, and only
		after doing so do we call <span class="monoText">super.init()</span>. In
		other words, when we create an instance of a class, we must first initialize
		all the stored properties for that class. If the class is a subclass, we
		must then initialize all the stored properties for its superclass with
		<span class="monoText">super.init()</span>. Complying with this syntax, the
		chain continues all the way up to the base class.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="boldText">Caution.</span> Initializers are not inherited by
		their subclasses. For example, consider the following class hierarchy:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Issue {
			typealias Name = (firstName: String, lastName: String)
			var id: Int
			var issueTitle: String
			
			init(id: Int, issueTitle: String) {
				self.id = id
				self.issueTitle = issueTitle
			}
		}
		
		class Article: Issue {
			var author: Name
			var articleTitle: String
		
			init(id: Int, issueTitle: String, author: Name, articleTitle: String) {
				self.author = author
				self.articleTitle = articleTitle
				super.init(id: id, issueTitle: issueTitle)
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we initialize an instance of <span class="monoText">Article</span>, we
		can't avoid initializaing the
		<span class="monoText">articleTitle</span> property. But what if the author
		hasn't settled on a title yet? Maybe we do not want to set this property
		just yet. The simplest solution is to set a dummy value:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let samB_article = Article(id: 1, issueTitle: "Diversity in Clerkships", author: (firstName: "Sam", lastName: "Bogart"), articleTitle: "")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Another solution is to just write another
		<span class="monoText">init</span> method, this time including an initial
		value for <span class="monoText">articleTitle</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Issue {
			typealias Name = (firstName: String, lastName: String)
			var id: Int
			var issueTitle: String
			
			init(id: Int, issueTitle: String) {
				self.id = id
				self.issueTitle = issueTitle
			}
		}
		
		class Article: Issue {
			var articleTitle: String
			var author: Name
		
			init(id: Int, issueTitle: String, author: Name, articleTitle: String) {
				self.articleTitle = articleTitle
				self.author = author
				super.init(id: id, issueTitle: issueTitle)
			}
			
			init(id: Int, issueTitle: String, author: Name) {
				self.articleTitle = ""
				self.author = author
				super.init(id: id, issueTitle: issueTitle)
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		<span class="monoText"><span class="monoText">required.</span></span> On the
		other end of the spectrum, we might want all child classes of a particular
		class to implement a specific initializer. This is done by using the
		<span class="monoText">required</span> keyword:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Passenger {
			typealias Name = (firstName: String, lastName: String)
			var name: Name
			var ticketNum: Int
			init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int) {
				self.name = name
				self.ticketNum = ticketNum
			}
		}
		class FirstClass: Passenger {
			var eliteMember: Bool
			required override init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int) {
				self.eliteMember = true
				super.init(name: name, ticketNum: ticketNum)
			}
			init (name: Name, ticketNum: Int, eliteMember: Bool) {
				self.eliteMember = eliteMember
				super.init(name: name, ticketNum: ticketNum)
			}
		}
		class EconomyClass: Passenger {
			var byEmergencyExit: Bool
			init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int, byEmergencyExit: Bool) {
				self.byEmergencyExit = byEmergencyExit
				super.init(name: name, ticketNum: ticketNum)
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the code above, we have examples of
		<span class="term">designated initializers</span>. In the class
		<span class="monoText">FirstClass</span>, we have the required initializer
		<span class="monoText">init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int)</span>. We can write
		the required initializer more concisely as:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Passenger {
			typealias Name = (firstName: String, lastName: String)
			var name: Name
			var ticketNum: Int
			init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int) {
				self.name = name
				self.ticketNum = ticketNum
			}
		}
		class FirstClass: Passenger {
			var eliteMember: Bool
			required override convenience init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int) {
				self.init(name: name, ticketNum: ticketNum, eliteMember: false)
			}
			init (name: Name, ticketNum: Int, eliteMember: Bool) {
				self.eliteMember = eliteMember
				super.init(name: name, ticketNum: ticketNum)
			}
		}
		class EconomyClass: Passenger {
			var byEmergencyExit: Bool
			init(name: Name, ticketNum: Int, byEmergencyExit: Bool) {
				self.byEmergencyExit = byEmergencyExit
				super.init(name: name, ticketNum: ticketNum)
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The initializer <span class="monoText">self.init()</span> is called a
		<span class="term">convenience initializer</span> &mdash; it's an
		initializer provided purely for convenience; maybe whether the passenger is
		an <span class="monoText">eliteMember</span> is something we do not need to
		set on instantiation.
	</p>

	<p>
		An important point to bear in mind: If a subclass has no designated
		initializers, then the superclass's designated initializers are inherited.
		This is a critical distinction between a "regular" initializer an a
		designated initializer. Furthermore, if the subclass implements all the
		designated initializers from its superclass, then the subclass inherits all
		the convenience initializers from the superclass.
	</p>

	<p>
		Putting this all together, a designated initializer for a subclass must call
		a designated initializer from its immediate super class. In contrast, a
		convenience initializer ${f}$ must call another initializer from within the
		class. And inside the convenience initializer ${f,}$ there must ultimately
		be a call to a designated initializer.
	</p>

	<p>
		This requirement may seem restrictive at first, but it addresses the problem
		of <span class="italicsText">inheritance hell</span> &mdash; a class
		hierarchy so tall that we lose track of what properties an instance stores.
		Many object-oriented languages do not provide this safety mechanism, leading
		to a common source of bugs.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="inheritance">
	<h4>Inheritance</h4>
	<p>
		Inheritance is a feature unique to classes. Structures and enumerations do
		not have any notion of inheritance. It is crucial to keep this distinction
		in mind whenever we write Swift code. Warning said, let's see some examples
		of inheritance.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose we have a class called <span class="monoText">Person</span>, and a
		class called <span class="monoText">Student</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var major: String
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String, major: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
				self.major = major
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The two types share a common property, <span class="monoText">name</span>.
		But, in the <span class="monoText">Student</span> class, we also have a
		property called <span class="monoText">major</span>. The problem: Every
		<span class="monoText">Student</span> is a
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>, but not every
		<span class="monoText">Person</span> is a
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>.Inheritance solves this problem by
		allowing us to <span class="term">extend</span> the
		<span class="monoText">Person</span> class. In Swift, this is done by simply
		including a colon after <span class="monoText">Student</span>, followed by
		the class we want to extend, <span class="monoText">Person</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Note how we included a default value for
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>, the empty string. This is because we
		are relying on the initializer for <span class="monoText">Person</span>, and
		that initializer does not include <span class="monoText">major</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If we create an instance of <span class="monoText">Student</span>, that
		instance will have access to all the properties and methods of
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		
		let jill = Person(firstName: "Jill", lastName: "Anderson")
		let graham = Student(firstName: "Graham", lastName: "Nagel")

		print(jill.name)
		print(graham.name)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		("Jill", "Anderson")
		("Graham", "Nagel")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In Swift, a class cannot inherit from multiple classes. But, a class can be
		extended to as many classes as we would like. In other words, there is no
		concept of <span class="term">multiple inheritance</span> in Swift. Thus, a
		class is either a subclass, or not a subclass. A class that is not a
		subclass is called a <span class="term">base class</span>. A subclass, of
		course, can itself be extended. This means we can construct
		<span class="term">class hierarchy</span> &mdash; a hierarchy of classes
		extending from other classes.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String = ""
			var researchArea: String = ""
			var thesis: String = ""
		}
		
		class Graduate: Student {
			var coursesTeaching: [String] = []
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		From the code above, the class <span class="monoText">Student</span> is
		extended by <span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> and
		<span class="monoText">Graduate</span>. All instances of
		<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> and all instaces of
		<span class="monoText">Graduate</span> can behave and be treated as either
		its type (<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> or
		<span class="monoText">Graduat</span>), or it can behave and be treated as a
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>. This phenomenon, where an instance
		can be treated as one thing and another, is called
		<span class="term">polymorphism</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall that an array must consist of the same type. This means that if we
		create an array composed of
		<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> instances and
		<span class="monoText">Graduate</span> instances, the array type will be
		<span class="monoText">[Student]</span>.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String = ""
			var researchArea: String = ""
			var thesis: String = ""
		}
		
		class Graduate: Student {
			var coursesTeaching: [String] = []
		}
		
		let johnS = Undergraduate(firstName: "John", lastName: "Schmidt")
		let kenF = Graduate(firstName: "Ken", lastName: "Fuji")
		let yunaC = Undergraduate(firstName: "Yuna", lastName: "Choi")
		let conferenceAttendees = [johnS, kenF, yunaC]
		print(type(of: conferenceAttendees))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Array&lt;Student&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Thus, the type for an array consisting of different class instances will be
		the (a) the most specific and (b) common superclass between the instances.
		In the example above, the superclass is
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>. If we had included an instance of
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>, then the type would be
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Casting to a Superclass.</span> Like many
		object-oriented languages, Swift allows us to cast an instance of a class to
		a superclass. For example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Being {
			var name: String
			var immortal: Bool = false
			var age: Int?
			init(name: String) {
				self.name = name
				if immortal == true {
					self.age = nil
				}
			}
		}
		class Witch: Being {
			var canFly: Bool = false
		}
		class Sorceres: Witch {
			var canProphesize: Bool = true
		}
		class Vampire: Being {
			var drinksBlood: Bool = true
		}
		
		var minerva = Witch(name: "Minerva")
		var dracula = Vampire(name: "Dracula")
		dracula.immortal = true
		var haley = minerva as Being		
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the code above, we declared a new variable called
		<span class="monoText">haley</span>, which stores the instance
		<span class="monoText">minerva</span> as an instance of
		<span class="monoText">Being</span>. Casting an instance of a class into an
		instance of an <span class="term">ancestor class</span> is called
		<span class="term">upcasting</span>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="override">
	<p>
		<span class="topic"><span class="monoText">override</span>.</span> In Swift,
		subclasses can <span class="italicsText">override</span> methods and
		properties defined in their superclasses. For example, in the code below,
		the class <span class="monoText">B</span> inherits the method
		<span class="monoText">sound()</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class A {
			func sound() {
				print("Vroom")
			}
		}
		class B: A {
			override func sound() {
				print("Bang")

		}
		let foo = A()
		let bar = B()
		foo.sound()
		bar.sound()
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Vroom
		Bang
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		However, by appending the <span class="monoText">override</span> keyword, we
		override the inherited method <span class="monoText">sound()</span>,
		replacing it with a more specific implementation, unique to instances of
		<span class="monoText">B</span>.
