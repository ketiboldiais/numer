	<h3><span class="monoText">structs</span></h3>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">structure</span>, denoted in many languages with the
		symbol <span class="monoText">struct</span>, is a group of related data and
		functions. The related data inside a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> are called the structure's
		<span class="term">properties</span>. These properties represent what the
		structure <span class="italicsText">holds</span>. The functions inside a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> are called the structure's
		<span class="term">methods</span>. They represent what the structure
		<span class="italicsText">does</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of the built-in Swift types are actually
		<span class="monoText">structs</span>. For example,
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>, <span class="monoText">Bool</span>,
		<span class="monoText">Double</span>, <span class="monoText">String</span>,
		<span class="monoText">Array</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">Dictionary</span> are all
		<span class="monoText">structs</span>. Structures are immensely useful for
		grouping related <span class="italicsText">states</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">behaviors</span>. For example, we might have a
		structure representing a professor:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Professor {
			let name: String
			var courses: [String]
			var highestAward: String?
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the above, we have several properties: the field
		<span class="monoText">name</span>, which will store a
		<span class="monoText">String</span> type value,
		<span class="monoText">course</span>, which will store an array of
		<span class="monoText">Strings</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">highestAward</span>, which will store either a
		<span class="monoText">String</span> or
		<span class="monoText">nil</span> (maybe the professor does not have a
		highest award).
	</p>

	<p>
		In the code above, we have merely
		<span class="italicsText">declared</span> a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>. To actually use the
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, we must
		<span class="italicsText">initialize</span> it:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Professor {
			let name: String
			var courses: [String]
			var highestAward: String?
		}
		Professor(name: "James Moriarty", courses: ["logic"], highestAward: "best lecturer")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		What we've just created is an <span class="term">instance</span> of
		<span class="monoText">Professor</span>. We can store this instance in a
		variable or a constant:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Professor {
			let name: String
			var courses: [String]
			var highestAward: String?
		}
		var jamesMoriarty = Professor(name: "James Moriarty", courses: ["logic"], highestAward: "best lecturer")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		A <span class="monoText">struct</span> is essentially a blueprint for
		collecting related data. Once declared, we can create as many instances of
		that <span class="monoText">struct</span> as we would like:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Professor {
			let name: String
			var courses: [String]
			var highestAward: String?
		}
		var jamesMoriarty = Professor(name: "James Moriarty", courses: ["logic"], highestAward: "best lecturer")
		var sherlockHolmes = Professor(name: "Sherlock Holmes", courses: ["logic"], highestAward: "worst lecturer")
		var johnWatson = Professor(name: "John Watson", courses: ["anatomy"], highestAward: "kindest lecturer")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Here is another <span class="monoText">struct</span>, this time containing
		methods:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Animal {
			let name: String
			let noise: String
			func speak() {
				print("\(noise)")
			}
		}
		var cat = Animal(name: "cat", noise: "meow")
		cat.speak()
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		meow
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we want to change any of the properties above, we use dot-notation.
		However, to change the property of an instance, the instance must be a
		variable (i.e., declared with <span class="monoText">var</span>), and the
		property must be a variable (also declared with
		<span class="monoText">var</span>).
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that <span class="monoText">structs</span> are really intended to
		collect related data. In Swift, a <span class="monoText">struct</span> is a
		value type. This means that with every instance of a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, that instance's variables are
		independent. For example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Foo {
			var propA : Bool
			var propB : Int
		}
		var x = Foo(propA: true, propB: 0)
		var y = x
		y.propA = false
		y.propB = 1
		print(x)
		print(y)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Foo(propA: true, propB: 0)
		Foo(propA: false, propB: 1)
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice that when we mutated the <span class="monoText">Foo</span> instance
		<span class="monoText">y</span>, we did not mutate the
		<span class="monoText">Foo</span> instance <span class="monoText">x</span>.
		This is because the instances <span class="monoText">x</span> and
		<span class="monoText">y</span> are entirely independent of one another.
