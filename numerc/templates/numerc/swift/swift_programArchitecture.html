	<h3>Program Architecture</h3>
	<p>
		Whether we're designing UI or functionality, putting all of our code into a
		single file leads to a phenomenon called
		<span class="term">spaghetti</span> code. This is where a source code file
		grows so large that it becomes unnecessarily difficult to find certain code
		and worse, debugging. The solution then is separate source code into their
		respective files, forming a more modular
		<span class="term">program architecture</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Often, the best way to divide source code into separate files is by
		following the
		<span class="term">single responsbility principle</span> &mdash; separate
		source code into their respective modules depending on their responsibility.
		For example, we might have source code that parses a file, code that
		authenticates a user, code that performs a calculation, a code for the main
		page layout, code for settings layout, and so on. By separating source code
		into separate modules (whether inside the code through separate classes or
		structs or more broadly in separate files), it is much easier to debug and
		analyze code. It also prevents code from
		<span class="italicsText">cross-contamination</span>. Often, having so much
		source code in a single class, struct, or file can lead to forgetting a
		parentheses or brace for a particular block, thereby leading to unexpected
		results.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Magic Numbers.</span> When we write Swift code, it is
		best practice to avoid using too many literals. For example, consider these
		shape objects:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Shapes: View {
			var body: some View {
				VStack {
					Circle()
						.strokeBorder(lineWidth: 20.0)
					RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20.0)
						.stroke(lineWidth: 12.0)
				}
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The numbers above are literals, and they are colloquially called
		<span class="term">magic numbers</span>. We call them magic numbers because
		they do not give any indication of where they came from, or what exactly
		they mean. They are just a number. They are also problematic because if we
		wanted to change these numbers, we would have to search throughout the
		program to look for where these numbers are relevant.
	</p>
	<p>
		The best practice approach is to use
		<span class="term">named constants</span>. Values that never change should
		be bound to a constant (so they never change), and we write those constants
		separately from the objects that need them. This way, if we ever need to
		make a change, we simply change write a different literal for the value
		bound to the constant. Here is one way to do so:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		enum Constants {
			enum General {
				public static let circleStrokeWidth = CGFloat(20.0)
				public static let roundRectStrokeWidth = CGFloat(12.0)
				public static let roundRectCornerRadius = CGFloat(20.0)
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can then rewrite the original code above as:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Shapes: View {
			var body: some View {
				VStack {
					Circle()
						.strokeBorder(lineWidth: Constants.General.circleStrokeWidth)
					RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: Constants.General.roundRectCornerRadius)
						.stroke(lineWidth: Constants.General.roundRectStrokeWidth)
				}
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		While it may seem like more verbose code, it is far more readable and easier
		to understand that using magic numbers. This is a good example of balancing
		between conciseness and readability.
	</p>
