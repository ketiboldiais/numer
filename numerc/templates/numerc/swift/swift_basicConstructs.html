	<h3>Basic Constructs</h3>

	<p>
		In the next few sections, we cover basic constructs in Swift &mdash;
		variables, functions, control flow, methods and properties, arrays, strings,
		etc. Much of these constructs should look familiar, but some constructs have
		remarkably powerful features. Given that the basic constructs are
		rudimentary, we will pay close attention to these Swift features.
	</p>

	<p>True to tradition, here is our first program:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		print("Hello, world!")
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Hello, world!
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		This looks similar to C and Python. However, unlike C, we do not need to
		place code in a <span class="monoText">main()</span> function. All code
		written in the global scope is an entry point to the program. We also need
		not write semicolons at the end of every statement, nor do we need to import
		a separate library for I/O and string handling.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Statements.</span> A Swift command is a statement.
		Because Swift's default path of execution is to execute lines in sequence,
		line breaks are meaningful:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		// This is bad
		print("Hello world") print("Hello world")

		// This is ok
		print("Hello world"); print("Hello world")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The use of a semicolon tells Swift when a statement is complete. They are
		not necessary in Swift, but they are necessary in Objective-C, the former
		language for iOS development.
	</p>

	<p>
		Swift is a <span class="term">compiled language</span>. This means that
		Swift source code undergoes both compilation (subject to compilation errors)
		and execution (subject to runtime errors). This means our source must first
		pass compilation before it can <span class="italicsText">run</span>. Swift's
		compiler is extremely strict, and Xcode will raise warnings as we write
		statements.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Axioms of Swift.</span> Somewhat like Python, everything
		in Swift is an <span class="term">object</span>. The difference, however, is
		that we must think of this idea somewhat differently from other
		object-oriented languages. Rather than thinking of every object in Swift as
		having a particular method associated with it, we must think of every object
		in Swift as capable of receiving a certain
		<span class="italicsText">message</span>. Just as certain objects in Python
		or Java can only perform certain actions, objects in Swift can only receive
		certain messages. To send a message to an object in Swift, we use
		<span class="term">dot-notation</span>. For example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		cat.meow()
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In this case, <span class="monoText">cat</span> is the object, and we send
		it the message <span class="monoText">meow()</span>. It is often good style
		to use a line break for such dot-notated expresions:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		cat
			.meow()
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In Swift, we can think of every noun as an object, and every verb as a
		message. As evidence of how everything in Swift is an object, we extend
		built-in types:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		extension Int {
			func greet() {
				print("Hello, I'm \(self)")
			}
		}
		
		0.sayHello()
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Hello, I'm 0
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		From the above example, we can see that <span class="monoText">0</span> is
		the object. This is significant difference from other languages, where
		<span class="monoText">Int</span> is a primitive type that cannot be
		modified, and its instances are <span class="term">scalars</span>. In Swift,
		there are no scalars &mdash; everything is an object.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Object Type.</span> Those with object-oriented
		backgrounds might ask, What is the object type then? In Swift, there are
		three possible object types: (1) <span class="term">class</span>, (2)
		<span class="term">struct</span> and (3) <span class="term">enum</span>. We
		will explore these different entities in a later section.
	</p>

<section id="comments">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Comments.</span> Comments in Swift are similar to
		comments in C, Objective-C, and Java:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		// This is a single line comment

		/*
		 *
		 * This is a
		 * multiline comment
		 *
		*/
	</code></pre>
</section>
