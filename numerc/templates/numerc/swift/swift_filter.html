<section id="filter">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">.filter</span> In this section, we examine the methods
		<span class="monoText">filter()</span>,
		<span class="monoText">reduce()</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">sort()</span>. The tasks these methods accomplish are
		routine, but implementing them can be cumbersome. For that reason, Swift
		provides them as built-in methods so we do not have to worry about those
		implementation details (granted, there are situations where we might want to
		implement our own algorithms).
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall a previous example where we wanted to return an array of arrays of
		<span class="monoText">String</span> values into a single array whose
		elements come before some <span class="monoText">String</span> value:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = [
			["a", "f"],
			["g"],
			["d", "s", "j"]
		]
		let barr = arr.flatMap { (vals) -> [String] in
			var carr: [String] = []
			for val in vals where val < "l" {
				carr.append(val)
			}
			return carr
		}
		print(barr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "f", "g", "d", "j"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		We can perform the same operation more concisely with the
		<span class="monoText">.filter</span> method:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = [
			["a", "f"],
			["g"],
			["d", "s", "j"]
		]
		let barr = arr.flatMap { (vals) -> [String] in
			vals.filter {(val) -> Bool in
				val < "l"
			}
		}
		print(barr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "f", "g", "d", "j"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can write the code even more concisely:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = [
			["a", "f"],
			["g"],
			["d", "s", "j"]
		]
		let barr = arr.flatMap { (vals) -> [String] in
			vals.filter { $0 < "l" }
		}
		print(barr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "f", "g", "d", "j"]
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section id="reduce">
	<p>
		<span class="topic"><span class="monoText">.reduce</span></span> Suppose we
		have a collection of several values, and want to combine all those values
		into a single new value. The most basic way to do this would be to use a
		<span class="monoText">for</span> loop:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arrNum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		func sum(_ arr: [Int]) -> Int {
			var result = 0
			for val in arr {
				result += val
			}
			return result
		}
		let total = sum(arrNum)
		print(total)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		15
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The <span class="monoText">.reduce</span> method provides a more concise way
		of accomplishing the same computation. The general syntax for
		<span class="monoText">.reduce</span>:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>let ${r}$ = ${c}$.reduce(${i}$) {(${a, b}$) -> ${r_t}$ in</li>
			<ul>
				<li>${statements}$</li>
			</ul>
			<li>}</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		In the syntax above: ${r}$ is the variable we want to store combined value
		(the result of the computation) in. ${c}$ is some collection. ${i}$ is the
		initial value of the accumulator (the variable to be mutated). ${a}$ and
		${b}$ are arguments to be used inside the closure, where ${a}$ is the
		accumulator, and ${b}$ is each element in the collection. Finally, ${r_t}$
		is the return type of the computation. Applying this to the previous
		example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arrNum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		func sum(_ arr: [Int]) -> Int {
			let result = arr.reduce(0) {(total, val) -> Int in
				total + val
			}
			return result
		}
		let total = sum(arrNum)
		print(total)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		15
	</code></pre>

	<p>The code above can be written even more concisely:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arrNum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		func sum(_ arr: [Int]) -> Int {
			let result = arr.reduce(0, +)
			return result
		}
		let total = sum(arrNum)
		print(total)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		15
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Of course, the above code assumes that the only thing we would like to do is
		accumulate the result.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose we want to perform a computation on each element of the array,
		returning a new array where each element is modified in place. We can do so
		by passing the <span class="monoText">into:</span> parameter.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arrNum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		func sum(_ arr: [Int]) -> [Int] {
			let barr = arr.reduce(into: []) {(result, val) in
				result.append(val * 2)
			}
			return barr
		}
		let total = sum(arrNum)
		print(total)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the code above, we are telling Swift to reduce
		<span class="monoText">arr</span> into an empty array called
		<span class="monoText">result</span>. Then, we append to
		<span class="monoText">result</span> each element of
		<span class="monoText">arr</span> multiplied by 2.
	</p>

<section id="sort">
	<h4>Sort</h4>
	<p>
		Sorting algorithms can be cumbersome to implement, and for most
		applications, Swift's built-in sort method can handle our needs easily. As
		such, for most tasks, we won't need to write our own sorting algorithms
		(most &mdash; there are situations where Swift's algorithms may not be the
		best). To use Swift's <span class="monoText">.sort</span> method, we must
		include a closure. That closure tells Swift how the elements in the
		collection should be compared.
	</p>

	<p>
		Swift provides several sorting methods. The
		<span class="monoText">.sort()</span> method will sort elements
		<span class="underlineText">in place</span>. This means
		<span class="monoText">.sort()</span> will mutate the existing collection.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var names = ["Dan", "Alice", "Jane", "Fen"]
		names.sort()
		print(names)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["Alice", "Dan", "Fen", "Jane"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we want to sort the elements in a particular way, we pass into the
		parameter list a closure:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var names = ["Dan", "Alice", "Jane", "Fen"]
		names.sort {(a, b) -> Bool in a > b}
		print(names)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["Jane", "Fen", "Dan", "Alice"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we want to create a new sorted array (i.e., not mutating the existing
		array), we used the <span class="monoText">.sorted()</span> method. Suppose
		we wanted to sort the names from longest to shortest:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var names = ["Dan", "Alice", "Jane", "Fen"]
		var newArr = names.sorted { $0.count > $1.count }
		print(newArr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["Alice", "Jane", "Dan", "Fen"]
	</code></pre>
