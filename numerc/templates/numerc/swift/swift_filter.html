<section id="filter">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">.filter</span> In this section, we examine the methods
		<span class="monoText">filter()</span>,
		<span class="monoText">reduce()</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">sort()</span>. The tasks these methods accomplish are
		routine, but implementing them can be cumbersome. For that reason, Swift
		provides them as built-in methods so we do not have to worry about those
		implementation details (granted, there are situations where we might want to
		implement our own algorithms).
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall a previous example where we wanted to return an array of arrays of
		<span class="monoText">String</span> values into a single array whose
		elements come before some <span class="monoText">String</span> value:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = [
			["a", "f"],
			["g"],
			["d", "s", "j"]
		]
		let barr = arr.flatMap { (vals) -> [String] in
			var carr: [String] = []
			for val in vals where val < "l" {
				carr.append(val)
			}
			return carr
		}
		print(barr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "f", "g", "d", "j"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		We can perform the same operation more concisely with the
		<span class="monoText">.filter</span> method:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = [
			["a", "f"],
			["g"],
			["d", "s", "j"]
		]
		let barr = arr.flatMap { (vals) -> [String] in
			vals.filter {(val) -> Bool in
				val < "l"
			}
		}
		print(barr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "f", "g", "d", "j"]
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can write the code even more concisely:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = [
			["a", "f"],
			["g"],
			["d", "s", "j"]
		]
		let barr = arr.flatMap { (vals) -> [String] in
			vals.filter { $0 < "l" }
		}
		print(barr)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		["a", "f", "g", "d", "j"]
	</code></pre>
