	<blockquote>Views are immutable structures.</blockquote>
	<p>
		<span class="drop">S</span>wiftUI implements user interface with
		<span class="term">views</span>. At a lower level, we implement a view with
		a <span class="monoText">struct</span>. There are many different kinds of
		views &mdash; <span class="monoText">text</span>,
		<span class="monoText">slider</span>, <span class="monoText">button</span>,
		etc. Everything we see on the screen when we open an application is a view.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can think of a view as box, or Lego brick. They are rectangular in shape,
		and are placed in a modular fashion, much like a Lego structure. But how do
		we place these bricks?
	</p>
</section>

<section id="some_view">
	<h2><span class="monoText">some view</span></h2>
	<p>When we write views in Swift, we write the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="syntax">
				<li>struct ${\lang view \space name \rang}$: View {</li>
				<ul>
					<li>var body: some View {</li>
					<ul>
						<li>${\lang statements \rang}$</li>
					</ul>
					<li>}</li>
				</ul>
				<li>}</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What exactly is <span class="monoText">some View</span>? A view is just a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>. The variable
		<span class="monoText">body</span> is a property of the view
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">: someView</span> tells Swift that this particular
		property, <span class="monoText">body</span> behaves like a view. This is
		what allows Swift to infer the <span class="monoText">body</span> variable's
		type.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="stacks">
	<h2>Stacks</h2>
	<p>
		To organize views, we need a way to tell Swift how to place the views
		relative to one another. We do so with
		<span class="italicsText">view modifiers</span>, the most basic of which is
		a <span class="italicsText">view stack.</span> A view stack is essentially a
		container for other views. The views inside a view stack are called the view
		stack's <span class="italicsText">children</span>. View stacks come in three
		flavors: The <span class="monoText">VStack</span>,
		<span class="monoText">HStack</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">ZStack</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As with all view stacks, the
		<span class="monoText">VStack</span> (&#8220;Vertical Stack&#8221;) is a
		view that acts like a container for other views. The
		<span class="monoText">VStack</span> arranges its children in a vertical
		stack.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <span class="monoText">HStack</span> (&#8220;Horizontal Stack&#8221;),
		also acts like a container for other views. In contrast to the
		<span class="monoText">VStack</span>, the
		<span class="monoText">HStack</span> arranges its children in a horizontal
		stack.
	</p>

	<p>
		Where the <span class="monoText">VStack</span> and
		<span class="monoText">HStack</span> arrange their children along the ${x}$
		and ${y}$ axis respectively, the
		<span class="monoText">ZStack</span> arranges its children along the ${z}$
		axis. In other words, children inside a
		<span class="monoText">ZStack</span> are laid on top of one another.
	</p>

	<h2>Views: UI Components</h2>
	<p>
		Swift provides built-in components like buttons and text fields. Below are
		some of the most commonly used of these components.
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>View</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">Text()</span></td>
					<td>
						The <span class="monoText">text</span> view is a view that displays
						one or more lines of read-only text. We can think of this view as a
						text field, with the added limitation that it is read-only (no
						writing/modifying by the user).
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">Slider()</span></td>
					<td>
						The <span class="monoText">slider</span> view displays a slider. The
						slider is an input interface that allows a user to enter a number by
						moving a control, called a <span class="italicsText">thumb</span>,
						along a straight line. The endpoints of the slider represent the
						minimum and the maximum input value.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">Button()</span></td>
					<td>
						The <span class="monoText">button</span> view displays a button.
						This input interface has takes only one of two inputs: (a) the
						button is pressed, and (b) the button is not pressed. We can place a
						<span class="monoText">text</span> view inside the button as a
						label.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">Spacer()</span></td>
					<td>Creates even spacing between views.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">ScrollView</span></td>
					<td>
						Scrollable view; for when the view is too large to fit the screen
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">List</span></td>
					<td>
						Creates a list view; similar to scroll view, but provides several
						other functionalities.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>

<section id="repeatingViews">
	<h2>Repeating Views</h2>
	<p>Suppose we have an array <span class="monoText">arr</span> with elements:</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let arr = ["a", "b", "c"]
	</code></pre>
	<p>Now suppose we want to create a view for each of the elements in <span class="monoText">arr</span>. We can do so with <span class="monoText">ForEach</span>:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct ContentView: View {
			let arr = ["a", "b", "c"]
				var body: some View {
					VStack {
						ForEach(arr, id: \.self) { element in
							Text(element)
						}
					}
				}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>The code above will create three <span class="monoText">Text()</span> views, each containing a string interpolated with the corresponding elements in <span class="monoText">arr</span>.</p>
</section>

<section id="view_immutability">
	<h2>View Immutability</h2>
	<p>
		Views are immutable structures. This means we cannot modify their properties
		once set. For example, suppose we had the following view:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct TileView: View {
			var isOpen: Bool = true
			var body: some View {
				ZStack {
					let shape = RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20)
					if isOpen {
						shape.fill().foregroundColor(.white)
						shape.stroke(lineWidth: 3)
					} else {
						shape.fill()
					}
				}
				.onTapGesture {
					isOpen = !isOpen
				}
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The last line, <span class="monoText">isOpen = !isOpen</span>, will return
		an error, telling us that we cannot assign to the property
		<span class="monoText">isOpen</span>. This is because
		<span class="monoText">self</span>, the structure
		<span class="monoText">TileView</span>, is immutable. If we want to modify
		the variable <span class="monoText">isOpen</span>, we will have to write
		separate code, the <span class="italicsText">logic</span> behind our views.
		There is, however, a small change we can make now to modify the property
		<span class="monoText">isOpen</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct TileView: View {
			@State var isOpen: Bool = true
			var body: some View {
				ZStack {
					let shape = RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20)
					if isOpen {
						shape.fill().foregroundColor(.white)
						shape.stroke(lineWidth: 3)
					} else {
						shape.fill()
					}
				}
				.onTapGesture {
					isOpen = !isOpen
				}
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice how we appended the <span class="monoText">@State</span> keyword.
		Appending the keyword <span class="monoText">@State</span> creates a pointer
		for the variable <span class="monoText">isOpen</span>, and that pointer
		points to a certain space in memory. When we tap on the rounded rectangle,
		we modify the value stored in the memory location pointed to by the pointer
		(in this case, changing <span class="monoText">isOpen</span> to its negated
		Boolean value).
	</p>
</section>

<section id="view_modifiers">
	<h2>View Modifiers</h2>
	<p>
		View modifiers are what we use to style views. For example, if we want to
		set an opacity to text as well as a border, we would write:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		Text("Hello world")
			.opacity(0.5)
			.border(Color.red, width: 1.5)
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Note that everytime we apply a view modifier, Swift creates a new version of
		the original view. Thus, when we write
		<span class="monoText">Text("Hello world").opacity(0.5)</span>, we create
		modified view of <span class="monoText">Text("Hello world")</span>. In this
		case, the text has an opacity of 0.5. When we write,
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>Text.("Hello world").opacity(0.5).border(Color.red, width: 1.5)</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		we modify <span class="monoText">Text("Hello world").opacity(0.5)</span>.
		That border is not transparent, because the border modifier is only adding a
		red border around the original view. If we wanted the border to be
		transparent, we would write:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		Text("Hello world")
			.border(Color.red, width: 1.5)
			.opacity(0.5)
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		This demonstrates a rule with view modifiers: Order matters. Below are some
		helpful view modifiers.
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>View Modifier</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">.onTapGesture(perform: {})</span></td>
					<td>Executes a function on tap.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="monoText">.aspectRatio()</span></td>
					<td>Sets the dimensions of a given view</td>
				</tr>

<section id="theory_behind_views">
	<h2>Swift Theory: <span class="monoText">Views</span></h2>
	<p>
		The foundational axiom of OOP (Object-oriented Programming) is to associate
		certain pieces of data with functionality. For example, a data of type
		<span class="monoText">dog</span> might have related data like
		<span class="monoText">name</span>, <span class="monoText">breed</span>,
		<span class="monoText">color</span>, and <span class="monoText">sex</span>.
		We call this related data <span class="term">properties.</span> The data
		type might also have related functionality like
		<span class="monoText">bark</span> and <span class="monoText">growl</span>.
		These related functions are called <span class="term">methods</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once we've created the data type <span class="monoText">dog</span>, we can
		create <span class="term">instances</span> of that type. These instances are
		called <span class="term">objects</span>. For example, we might have an
		instance of a <span class="monoText">dog</span> called
		<span class="monoText">hachiko</span> and another instance of a
		<span class="monoText">dog</span> called <span class="monoText">cujo</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In Swift, there are two ways to design these custom data types: with a
		<span class="term"><span class="term">class</span></span
		>, or with a <span class="term"><span class="monoText">struct</span></span
		>. In languages like Objective-C, <span class="monoText">class</span> and
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> are two very different entities. In
		Swift, however, the differences between a
		<span class="monoText">class</span> and a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> are subtle;
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>s being much more powerful.
	</p>

	<p>
		In a Swift application, everything (e.g.,
		<span class="monoText">view</span>s) is an instace of a particular
		<span class="monoText">class</span> or
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> that communicate with each other. Swift
		provides many default data types: <span class="monoText">button</span>,
		<span class="monoText">text</span>,
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span>, etc. When we create the
		application's layout, we are creating a custom data type.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each of the <span class="monoText">view</span>s inside our layout, as an
		object, has data and functionality. For example, if we create a
		<span class="monoText">button</span> object, that button might have several
		properties: a <span class="monoText">View</span> to display; a
		<span class="monoText">position</span>; a
		<span class="monoText">width</span>; a <span class="monoText">height</span>;
		and if we have a label for the button, a <span class="monoText">text</span>.
		That <span class="monoText">button</span> object can also have methods
		&mdash; recognizing a user tap; highlighting itself; a trigger action; etc.
		The general syntax for calling a method:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>${Obj}$</li>
			<ul>
				<li>${m.}$(${p_0 \ldots p_n}$)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<ul class="def">
			<li class="where">${Obj}$ is the object's name,</li>
			<li>${m}$ is the method, and</li>
			<li>${p_0 \ldots p_n}$ are the parameters</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The <span class="term">parameters</span> to a method are the necessary
		arguments to be passed into the method. We can think of them as the inputs
		that must be passed into the method for the method to work. Commanding an
		instance to call a method is how we get instances to perform certain
		actions, and more broadly, how we get an application to perform. A clear
		example of calling a method is when we apply view modifiers:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		Text("Hello world")
			.bold()
			.kerning(2.0)
	</code></pre>

	<h3>Local Variables</h3>
	<p>
		Views can have local variables. Those variables are called the view's
		<span class="italicsText">properties</span>. Swift provides two ways to bind
		properties to a view: (1) a <span class="term">stored property</span>, and
		(2) a <span class="term">computed property</span>.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		// These are stored properties
		var subtotal: Double
		var discountRate: Double
		var tax: Double

		// These are computed properties
		var discountAmount: Double {
			return subtotal * discountRate
		}
		
		var total: Double {
			return (subtotal - discountAmount) + tax 
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		We use a stored property when we just want a particular instance to store a
		piece of data. If we have related data that must be computed, we use a
		computed property. To see how all of this works in the context of SwiftUI,
		consider the following code:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		import SwiftUI

		struct ContentView: View {
			var body: some View {
				VStack {
					VStack {
						Text("Hello world")
							.kerning(1.0)
							.bold()
					}
				}
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the code above, the line
		<span class="monoText">struct ContentView: View</span> creates an instance
		of the <span class="monoText">struct</span>
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span>. More specifically, we are telling
		Swift, "Create a <span class="monoText">View</span> object called
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span>." If we go to the file called
		<span class="monoText">AppName.swift</span> (the Swift file other than
		<span class="monoText">ContentView.swift</span>), we see the following code:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		import SwiftUI

		@main
		struct nameApp: App {
			var body: some Scene {
				WindowGroup {
					ContentView()
				}
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The line <span class="monoText">ContentView()</span> creates an instance of
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span> based on the
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> we created in
		<span class="monoText">ContentView.swift</span>. Back inside
		<span class="monoText">ContentView.swift</span>, we see the line
		<span class="monoText">var body: some View { ... }</span>. This line creates
		a <span class="italicsText">property</span> of
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span>. More specifically, it creates a
		property called <span class="monoText">body</span> of type
		<span class="monoText">some View</span>. That property,
		<span class="monoText">body</span>, is where all other views placed inside.
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice that <span class="monoText">body</span> is declared with
		<span class="monoText">var</span> rather than
		<span class="monoText">let</span>. This is because
		<span class="monoText">body</span> stores data, and more specifically, it
		stores mutable data &mdash; data that can be changed. The line
		<span class="monoText">var body: some View { ... }</span> tells Swift, "This
		is a definition for a variable called <span class="monoText">body</span> of
		type <span class="monoText">some View</span>."
	</p>

	<p>
		Question: Why is it called <span class="monoText">some View</span>? The
		keyword <span class="monoText">some</span> is used because there are many
		different kinds of <span class="monoText">View</span>s. We have
		<span class="monoText">button</span>, <span class="monoText">text</span>,
		<span class="monoText">VStack</span>, etc. This tells Swift that
		<span class="monoText">body</span> will contain a
		<span class="monoText">View</span> or something that behaves like a
		<span class="monoText">View</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Everything after <span class="monoText">some View</span> contains the
		contents of <span class="monoText">body</span>. All of the lines containing
		view modifiers are examples of calling methods.
	</p>
