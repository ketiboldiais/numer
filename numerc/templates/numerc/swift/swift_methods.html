<section id="methods">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">More on Methods.</span> Methods define the behavior of a
		named type. In other words, what the values of the named type can do. For
		example, suppose we are defining the actions of a video game character:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		enum Actions {
			case sedentary
			case moving
			func jump() -> Bool {
				return true
			}
			func duck() -> Bool {
				return true
			}
			func forward() -> Bool {
				return true
			}
			func backward() -> Bool {
				return true
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		All of the functions above are methods, so every instance of
		<span class="monoText">Actions</span> will have these methods.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic"><span class="monoText">self.</span></span> Recall that
		we can append <span class="monoText">CaseIterable</span> to an enumeration
		so as to return an array consisting of all the enumeration's cases. Suppose
		we had the following enumeration:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		enum TrafficLight: CaseIterable {
			case green, yellow, red
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Let's include a method that changes the traffic light by whatever amount we
		would like:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		enum TrafficLight: CaseIterable {
			case green, yellow, red
			
			mutating func advance(by x: UInt) {
				let indexOfCurrentLight = TrafficLight.allCases.firstIndex(of: self)!
				let indexOfNextLight = indexOfCurrentLight + Int(x)
				self = TrafficLight.allCases[indexOfNextLight % TrafficLight.allCases.count]
			}
		}
		TrafficLight.allCases
		var juncture1: TrafficLight = .red
		print(juncture1)
		juncture1.advance(by: 1)
		print(juncture1)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		red
		green
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The line
		<span class="monoText"
			>TrafficLight.allCases[indexOfNextLight %
			TrafficLight.allCases.count</span
		>
		is a clever of way of ensuring an index outside the bounds will wrap around.
		Here, <span class="monoText">count</span> is 3. Say our
		<span class="monoText">indexOfCurrentLight</span> is 1. If we put in 6, then
		<span class="monoText">indexOfNextLight</span> is 7. This is out of bounds.
		So, we take <span class="monoText">indexOfNextLight</span>, which is 7, and
		divide it by the number of elements, which is 3. This return a remainder of
		1, and it is what we use as the index.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <span class="monoText">self</span> keyword is what we use to refer to
		the instance itself. In the function above, we also included the keyword
		<span class="monoText">mutating</span>. We include this keyword because the
		method mutates instance variables.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic"><span class="monoText">init.</span></span> The
		<span class="monoText">init</span> keyword is what we use when we want every
		new instance of a <span class="monoText">struct</span> or
		<span class="monoText">class</span> to have default properties. For example,
		maybe have a <span class="monoText">Customer</span>
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> and we want every new instance of
		<span class="monoText">Customer</span> to have a default property:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Customer {
			var name: String
			var age: UInt
			var accountStatus: String
			init(name: String, age: UInt, accountStatus = "Active") {
				self.name = name
				self.age = age
				self.accountStatus = accountStatus
			}
		}

		var johnAsh = Customer(name: "John Ash", age: 29)
		print(johnAsh.accountStatus)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Active
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can use structures to store functions we often use. For example:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Maths {
			// computes the hypotenuse
			static func hypotenuse(x: Double, y: Double) -> Double {
				(x * x + y * y).squareRoot()
			}
			// computes volume of a cuboid
			static func cuboidVolume(length: Double, width: Double, height: Double) -> Double {
				length * width * height
			}
			// computes area of a circle
			static func circleArea(radius: Double) -> Double {
				2 * radius * Double.pi
			}
		}
		let A_B_hypotenuse = Maths.hypotenuse(x: 2.0, y: 7.0)
		let bangVolume = Maths.cuboidVolume(length: 2.0, width: 3.0, height: 3.5)
		let fooArea = Maths.circleArea(radius: 3.0)
		
		print("Hypotenuse is: \(A_B_hypotenuse)")
		print("Volume is: \(bangVolume)")
		print("Circle's area is: \(fooArea)")
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Hypotenuse is: 7.280109889280518
		Volume is: 21.0
		Circle's area is: 18.84955592153876
	</code></pre>

<section id="computed_properties_v_methods">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Computed Properties v. Methods</span> From the
		discussion thus far, properties hold values, and methods perform
		computations. Some of those properties can be
		<span class="italicsText">computed properties</span> &mdash; properties
		whose values are determined based on existing properties. Question: When
		should we use computed properties and when should we use methods?
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a fair question because might have a method that returns a single
		value, computed from existing properties. If this is the case, then that
		value could also be stored as a computed property. For most programs, which
		route to take comes down to style.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, there are some considerations with respect to efficiency. Computed
		properties are computed the moment we instantiate the particular named type.
		If the computed property is a particularly resource-intensive computation,
		then it might be best to use a method. Of course, if we find ourselves
		repeatedly using the particular value, then it may be best to use a computed
		property.
	</p>
