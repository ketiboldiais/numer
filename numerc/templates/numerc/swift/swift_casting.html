<section id="casting">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Casting.</span> Unlike languages like JavaScript, Swift
		never implicitly converts a a value to another type. If we want to convert a
		value, we must explicitly do so.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let saleText = "Buy now for "  
		let price = 4.99
		let advert = saleText + String(price)
		print(advert)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Buy now for 4.99
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice that if we removed the explicit conversion, Swift informs us that we
		cannot apply an operand to values of different types (in this case, a string
		and double).
	</p>
