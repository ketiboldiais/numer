<h1>SwiftUI and State</h1>
<section id="state_and_swiftUI">
	<p>
		Suppose we had a
		<span class="monoText">button View</span> inside our
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		Button(action: {})
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The expression <span class="monoText">action: {}</span> combines
		<span class="term">state</span> with the
		<span class="monoText">Button</span> object. In other words, when the user
		taps the button, then the code inside the braces is evaluated and executed.
		What is <span class="term">state</span>? A good way to think about state is
		in terms of a car dashboard. If we look at a dashboard, there are several
		pieces of data: <span class="italicsText">numeric values</span> like speed,
		fuel level, mileage; and Boolean values like low oil, flat tire, low tire
		pressure, emergency break off, etc. All of this data embodies the car's
		current <span class="italicsText">state</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, we can change the car's state by performing certain actions on that
		data. For example, if we refill our tank, the fuel level goes up. If we
		drive more miles, the mileage goes up. If we add more oil, the low oil
		indicator turns off, and if we pull the emergency break, the emergency break
		light goes on. In doing all of this, we modify the car's state. We call the
		actions that change the car's state <span class="term">behavior</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		A car works properly only if state and behavior are in sync. If we continue
		driving, the fuel level should go down, and the odometer should go up. If we
		step on the accelerator, the speedometer should go up, and if we break, it
		should go down. When state and behavior are not in sync, not only does the
		car fail to work properly, it potentially becomes dangerous.
	</p>

	<p>
		This same phenomenon applies to programs, and more broadly, applications. If
		we fail to properly link state and behavior between properties and methods,
		we manifest bugs. The application informs the user there are 0 new messages,
		when there is actually 1. The application tells the user an order was
		completed, when the order was never sent. SwiftUI is cognizant of how
		dangerous these bugs can be and forces the programmer to be consistent when
		writing code.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, suppose that we want to display a popup alert when the user taps the
		<span class="monoText">Button View</span>. In SwiftUI, there are only two
		possible conditions for displaying a popup alert: (1) the popup alert is
		displayed on the screen, or (2) the popup alert is not displayed on the
		screen. This means the popup alert has a Boolean value:
		<span class="monoText">true</span> or <span class="monoText">false</span>.
		The Boolean value for this popup alert is an example of data that must be
		accounted for in our <span class="monoText">ContentView</span> object. To do
		so, we write the following:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		import SwiftUI

		struct ContentView: View {
			@State private var alertIsVisible: Bool = false

			var body: some View {
				Button(action: {
					self.alertIsVisible = true
				}) {
					Text("Tap for Alert")
				}
			}
		}

	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The keyword <span class="monoText">@State</span> tells Swift that we are
		creating a <span class="italicsText">state</span> variable, meaning, this
		variable will change depending on something inside this
		<span class="monoText">ContentView</span>. We also include the keyword
		<span class="monoText">private</span> to indicate that the variable belongs
		only to <span class="monoText">ContentView</span> (more on this in another
		section). Finally, we declare the variable
		<span class="monoText">alertIsVisible</span>, which is of type
		<span class="monoText">Bool</span>, and initialize it the value
		<span class="monoText">false</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In our <span class="monoText">Button view</span>, we write
		<span class="monoText">self.alertIsVisible = true</span>, which effectively
		tells Swift, when the button is tapped, change the value of
		<span class="monoText">alertIsVisible</span> to
		<span class="monoText">true</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each state variable has an initial value. That value is updated, or mutated,
		based on the execution of some code in the body. Now, we want to actually
		display the alert when the button is tapped:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		import SwiftUI

		struct ContentView: View {
			@State private var alertIsVisible: Bool = false

			var body: some View {
				Button(action: {
					self.alertIsVisible = true
				}) {
					Text("Tap for Alert")
				}
				.alert(isPresented: $alertIsVisible, 
					content: {
						return Alert(
							title: Text("popup1"), 
							message: Text("This is a pop-up"), 
							dismissButton: 
								.default(Text("Dismiss")))
					})
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		There are several things to note in this code. First, note that when the
		<span class="monoText">Button View</span> is tapped, the state variable
		<span class="monoText">alertIsVisible</span> updates to
		<span class="monoText">true</span>. Because the state variable is now
		<span class="monoText">true</span>, we can proceed to call the
		<span class="monoText">.alert()</span> method. The
		<span class="monoText">.alert()</span> method takes several arguments,
		first, an argument called <span class="monoText">isPresented</span>, and
		argument called <span class="monoText">content</span>. The
		<span class="monoText">isPresented</span> argument is assigned
		<span class="monoText">$alertIsVisible</span>, a variable binding. The
		<span class="monoText">content</span> argument has several properties:
		<span class="monoText">title</span>, <span class="monoText">message</span>,
		and <span class="monoText">dismissButton</span>. Here, we've passed a
		<span class="monoText">Text</span> object of type
		<span class="monoText">View</span>. For the
		<span class="monoText">dismissButton</span>, we've used the
		<span class="monoText">.default()</span> method, which uses SwiftUI's
		default button styling.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Variable Binding.</span> In the example above, we wrote
		<span class="monoText">.alert(isPresented: $alertIsVisible)</span>. This
		expression tells Swift, "This property called
		<span class="monoText">isPresented</span> is always bound to the variable
		<span class="monoText">alertIsVisible</span>."" The dollar sign,
		<span class="monoText">$</span>, is what tells Swift that we are indicating
		a binding. In this case, the property
		<span class="monoText">isPresented</span> is always bound to the state
		variable <span class="monoText">alertIsVisible</span>. The property
		<span class="monoText">isPresented</span> is what determines whether the
		alert is visible. If its value is <span class="monoText">true</span>, then
		the alert is displays, otherwise, the alert is not displayed.

<section id="at_state">
	<h2><span class="monoText">@State</span></h2>
	<p>
		Recall that a View is read-only in Swift. This means that when we construct
		Views, only variables declared with <span class="monoText">let</span> (i.e.,
		constants) and computed properties (also read-only) should be placed in a
		View. The exception to this rule is a
		<span class="term">property wrapper</span>. We have several property
		wrappers in Swift: <span class="monoText">@State</span>,
		<span class="monoText">@ObservedObject</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">@EnvironmentObject</span>. We begin by discussing
		<span class="monoText">@State</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like other property wrappers, the
		<span class="monoText">@State</span> variable watches for changes, and upon
		detecting a change, the View it belongs to is rebuilt. Remember: The View
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> is constantly built, destroyed, and
		rebuilt; but the View <span class="monoText">body</span> lives on so long as
		the program runs. There are, however, certain aspects of
		<span class="monoText">@State</span> that we must always bear in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, when we create an <span class="monoText">@State</span> variable for a
		View, we are storing data for that View. That storage is
		<span class="underlineText">always</span> temporary. If we ever have a need
		to store data permanently, that data must be stored in the Model.
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, <span class="monoText">@State</span> variables are also
		<span class="underlineText">always</span> private. In other words, an
		<span class="monoText">@State</span> variable is something used only for a
		particular View.
	</p>
	<p>
		How does <span class="monoText">@State</span> work? During compilation, the
		<span class="monoText">@State</span> variable is replaced with a pointer to
		some space in the heap. Why a pointer? Two reasons: (1) the View is
		read-only; (2) The View <span class="monoText">struct</span> is destroyed
		and rebuilt upon the relevant changes, but the View's
		<span class="monoText">var body</span> lives on.
