		<h3>Variables</h3>
		In Swift, a variable is a
		<span class="term">name</span> that
		<span class="italicsText">refers</span> to an object. This may familiar to
		those coming from Java. The variable itself does not store the object, but a
		<span class="term">reference</span> to the object. The object to which
		variable refers to is called the variable's <span class="term">value</span>.
		There are two ways to initialize or declare a variable in Swift:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul class="syntax">
			<li>let ${name}$: ${type}$ = ${val}$</li>
			<li>var ${name}$: ${type}$ = ${val}$</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="marginnote"><span class="monoText">var</span> is short for &#8220;variable.&#8221; The keyword <span class="monoText">let</span> is more interesting. The word has traditionally been used in mathematics and physics to denote constants or base assumptions, making its way into the BASIC programming language in 1964, then to functional programming languages in the 1970s, all the way down to Swift and many others. Other languages have value-related keywords such as <span class="monoText">where</span>, <span class="monoText">def</span>, <span class="monoText">const</span>, and <span class="monoText">val</span>.</span>
		Like JavaScript, we have two ways to declare a variable: (1) with the atom
		<span class="monoText">let</span>, or (2) with the atom
		<span class="monoText">var</span>. However, unlike JavaScript, these two
		atoms have very specific meanings that must be adhered to strictly. First,
		<span class="monoText">let</span> is used to initialize a constant, and
		<span class="monoText">var</span> is used to initialize a variable. Which of
		<span class="monoText">let</span> and
		<span class="monoText">var</span> should be used depends on the problem and
		the programmer's style. For those coming from a functional programming
		background, <span class="monoText">let</span> should be the preferred
		choice, so as to avoid mutability (a constant cannot be mutated; once
		declared, it is assigned that value permanently). For those coming from an
		object-oriented programming background,
		<span class="monoText">var</span> may or may not be the desired choice (a
		variable can be mutated).
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var x = 10
		let z = 5

		// this is ok - you can mutate x - returns 15
		x = x + 5

		// this is bad - you cannot mutate a constant - returns an error
		z = z + 1
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Both constants and variables must have the same
		<span class="term">type</span> as the value assigned to the variable. This
		type can <span class="underlineText">never</span> change. For example, if we
		write <span class="monoText">var x = 5</span>, then the variable
		<span class="monoText">x</span> will always store a value of type
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>; <span class="monoText">x</span> can never
		store any other value of a different type, but it can store a different
		value of type <span class="monoText">Int</span>.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let implicitInt = 1
		let implicitFloat = 1.0
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		We can be more explicit with constants and variables by specifying its type:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let explicitInt: Int = 1
		let explicitFloat: Float = 1.0
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The colon is read "of type." Thus, writing
		<span class="monoText">var x: Int</span> tells Swift, "Create a variable
		named <span class="monoText">x</span> of type
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>." And if we wrote
		<span class="monoText">let y: Double</span>, we tell Swift, "Create a
		constant named <span class="monoText">x</span> of type
		<span class="monoText">Double</span>. It is not always necessary to
		explicitly specify a variable or constant's type. This is because Swift
		provides type-inference (i.e., if we simply wrote
		<span class="monoText">let x = 100</span>, Swift can infer that
		<span class="monoText">x</span> is a constant of type
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>).
	</p>

	<p>Declaring variables, we may see a warning stating &#8220;Variable ... was never mutated; consider ...&#8221; This is Swift's way of reminding us we should err on using constants whenever possible. Mutability is a double-edged sword. Whenever we declare a variable with <span class="monoText">var</span>, we add to the list of values we have to keep track of. Too long a list, and we increase the chances of bugs appearing.</p>

<section id="variable_and_constant_names">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Variable &amp; Constant Names</span>. Names in Swift can
		consist of ASCII and Unicode characters (this includes numbers, as long as
		they are not the first character in the name). What they cannot contain:
		whitespace, math symbols (e.g., +, -, *, /, %, etc.), as well as certain
		other characters that are seldom ever used as variable names in the real
		world (XCode will notify us when we violate these rules). In addition to
		these exclusions, Swift subscribes to
		<span class="term">camelCase</span> convention. Once a variable is declared,
		it cannot be "redeclared." In other words:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		// This will not work
		var x = 5
		var x = 6

		// But this will
		var x = 5
		x = 6
	</code></pre>
