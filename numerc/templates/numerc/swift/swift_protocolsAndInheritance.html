	<h3>Protocols &amp; Inheritance</h3>
	<p>Suppose we have the following structure:</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Mammal {
			typealias ageRange = ClosedRange<Double>
			static var blood: String = "Warm-blooded"
			let name: String
			let lifespan: ageRange
			init(name: String, maxAge: Double) {
				self.name = name
				self.lifespan = 0.0...maxAge
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>With the structure above, we created a type called <span class="monoText">Mammal</span>. But what if we instead created a type called <span class="monoText">Cat</span>? Or a type called <span class="monoText">Elephant</span>? These types would have all of the properties above, but they aren't necessarily the same. One solution would be write multiple structures, but then we would have duplicated code.</p>

	<p>There are two solutions to this problem. One is to use a <span class="monoText">class</span> instead of a <span class="monoText">struct</span>, and employ <span class="term">inheritance</span>. With inheritance, a class, called the <span class="term">subclass</span>, inherits properties and methods from an existing class, called the <span class="term">superclass</span>. We can think of this like the relationship between a set ${A}$ and its proper subset ${B.}$ All members of ${B}$ are members of ${A,}$ but not all members of ${A}$ are members of ${B.}$ For example, all cats are and behave like mammals, but not all mammals are and behave like cats.</p>

	<p>The second option is to use <span class="term">protocols</span>. A protocol establishes a set of requirements that a type <span class="underlineText">must meet</span>. Protocols are akin to a certification that states, this particular type is a certified <span class="monoText">Cat</span>. If the type does not satisfy the requirements, then it does not comply with the protocol and will not be certified.</p>

	<p>In the next sections, we explore and compare inheritance and protocols, and why we might use one over the other.</p>
