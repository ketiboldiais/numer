	<h3>Protocols &amp; Inheritance</h3>
	<p>
		In the following sections, we explore the concepts of inheritance,
		polymorphism, protocols, and extensions. These concepts are synonymous with
		object-oriented programming.
	</p>
	<p>Suppose we have the following structure:</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct Mammal {
			typealias ageRange = ClosedRange&lt;Double&gt;
			static var blood: String = "Warm-blooded"
			var name: String
			var lifespan: ageRange
			init(name: String, maxAge: Double) {
				self.name = name
				self.lifespan = 0.0...maxAge
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		With the structure above, we created a type called
		<span class="monoText">Mammal</span>. But what if we instead created a type
		called <span class="monoText">Cat</span>? Or a type called
		<span class="monoText">Elephant</span>? These types would have all of the
		properties above, but they aren't necessarily the same. One solution would
		be write multiple structures, but then we would have duplicated code.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two solutions to this problem. One is to use a
		<span class="monoText">class</span> instead of a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, and employ
		<span class="term">inheritance</span>. With inheritance, a class, called the
		<span class="term">subclass</span>, inherits properties and methods from an
		existing class, called the <span class="term">superclass</span>. We can
		think of this like the relationship between a set ${A}$ and its proper
		subset ${B.}$ All members of ${B}$ are members of ${A,}$ but not all members
		of ${A}$ are members of ${B.}$ For example, all cats are and behave like
		mammals, but not all mammals are and behave like cats.
	</p>

	<p>
		The second option is to use <span class="term">protocols</span>. A protocol
		establishes a set of requirements that a type
		<span class="underlineText">must meet</span>. Protocols are akin to a
		certification that states, this particular type is a certified
		<span class="monoText">Cat</span>. If the type does not satisfy the
		requirements, then it does not comply with the protocol and will not be
		certified.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the next sections, we explore and compare inheritance and protocols, and
		why we might use one over the other.

<section id="inheritance">
	<h4>Inheritance</h4>
	<p>
		Inheritance is a feature unique to classes. Structures and enumerations do
		not have any notion of inheritance. It is crucial to keep this distinction
		in mind whenever we write Swift code. Warning said, let's see some examples
		of inheritance.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose we have a class called <span class="monoText">Person</span>, and a
		class called <span class="monoText">Student</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var major: String
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String, major: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
				self.major = major
			}
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The two types share a common property, <span class="monoText">name</span>.
		But, in the <span class="monoText">Student</span> class, we also have a
		property called <span class="monoText">major</span>. The problem: Every
		<span class="monoText">Student</span> is a
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>, but not every
		<span class="monoText">Person</span> is a
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>.Inheritance solves this problem by
		allowing us to <span class="term">extend</span> the
		<span class="monoText">Person</span> class. In Swift, this is done by simply
		including a colon after <span class="monoText">Student</span>, followed by
		the class we want to extend, <span class="monoText">Person</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Note how we included a default value for
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>, the empty string. This is because we
		are relying on the initializer for <span class="monoText">Person</span>, and
		that initializer does not include <span class="monoText">major</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If we create an instance of <span class="monoText">Student</span>, that
		instance will have access to all the properties and methods of
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		
		let jill = Person(firstName: "Jill", lastName: "Anderson")
		let graham = Student(firstName: "Graham", lastName: "Nagel")

		print(jill.name)
		print(graham.name)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		("Jill", "Anderson")
		("Graham", "Nagel")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In Swift, a class cannot inherit from multiple classes. But, a class can be
		extended to as many classes as we would like. In other words, there is no
		concept of <span class="term">multiple inheritance</span> in Swift. Thus, a
		class is either a subclass, or not a subclass. A class that is not a
		subclass is called a <span class="term">base class</span>. A subclass, of
		course, can itself be extended. This means we can construct
		<span class="term">class hierarchy</span> &mdash; a hierarchy of classes
		extending from other classes.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String = ""
			var researchArea: String = ""
			var thesis: String = ""
		}
		
		class Graduate: Student {
			var coursesTeaching: [String] = []
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		From the code above, the class <span class="monoText">Student</span> is
		extended by <span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> and
		<span class="monoText">Graduate</span>. All instances of
		<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> and all instaces of
		<span class="monoText">Graduate</span> can behave and be treated as either
		its type (<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> or
		<span class="monoText">Graduat</span>), or it can behave and be treated as a
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>. This phenomenon, where an instance
		can be treated as one thing and another, is called
		<span class="term">polymorphism</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall that an array must consist of the same type. This means that if we
		create an array composed of
		<span class="monoText">Undergraduate</span> instances and
		<span class="monoText">Graduate</span> instances, the array type will be
		<span class="monoText">[Student]</span>.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Person {
			typealias name = (String, String)
			var name: name
			init(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
				self.name = (firstName, lastName)
			}
		}
		
		class Student: Person {
			var school: String = ""
		}
		
		class Undergraduate: Student {
			var major: String = ""
			var researchArea: String = ""
			var thesis: String = ""
		}
		
		class Graduate: Student {
			var coursesTeaching: [String] = []
		}
		
		let johnS = Undergraduate(firstName: "John", lastName: "Schmidt")
		let kenF = Graduate(firstName: "Ken", lastName: "Fuji")
		let yunaC = Undergraduate(firstName: "Yuna", lastName: "Choi")
		let conferenceAttendees = [johnS, kenF, yunaC]
		print(type(of: conferenceAttendees))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Array&lt;Student&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Thus, the type for an array consisting of different class instances will be
		the (a) the most specific and (b) common superclass between the instances.
		In the example above, the superclass is
		<span class="monoText">Student</span>. If we had included an instance of
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>, then the type would be
		<span class="monoText">Person</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic" id="casting_to_superclass"
			>Casting to a Superclass.</span
		>
		Like many object-oriented languages, Swift allows us to cast an instance of
		a class to a superclass. For example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Being {
			var name: String
			var immortal: Bool = false
			var age: Int?
			init(name: String) {
				self.name = name
				if immortal == true {
					self.age = nil
				}
			}
		}
		class Witch: Being {
			var canFly: Bool = false
		}
		class Sorceres: Witch {
			var canProphesize: Bool = true
		}
		class Vampire: Being {
			var drinksBlood: Bool = true
		}
		
		var minerva = Witch(name: "Minerva")
		var dracula = Vampire(name: "Dracula")
		dracula.immortal = true
		var haley = minerva as Being		
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the code above, we declared a new variable called
		<span class="monoText">haley</span>, which stores the instance
		<span class="monoText">minerva</span> as an instance of
		<span class="monoText">Being</span>. Casting an instance of a class into an
		instance of an <span class="term">ancestor class</span> is called
		<span class="term">upcasting</span>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="protocols">
	<h4>Protocols</h4>
	<p>
		Thus far, we've seen three named types: (1)
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, (2)
		<span class="monoText">class</span>, and (3)
		<span class="monoText">enum</span>. We now cover the fourth named type, the
		<span class="monoText">protocol</span>. Consider the following:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		class Animal {
			let name: String
			required init(name: String) {
				self.name = name;
			}
			func speak() { }
		}
		class Dog: Animal {
			var learnedTricks: Int
			init(name: String, learnedTricks: Int) {
				self.learnedTricks = learnedTricks
				super.init(name: name)
			}
			override func speak() {
				print("woof")
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The class <span class="monoText">Animal</span> is called an
		<span class="term">abstract class</span>. It is a class that is not meant to
		be instantiated directly. Usually, we can tell that a class is an abstract
		class when there are methods that do not have any blocks of code in their
		bodies. For example, in the <span class="monoText">Animal</span> class,
		there is a method called <span class="monoText">speak()</span>, to be
		inherited by all child classes. These methods contain no statements or
		expressions in their bodies because they are supposed to be overriden by the
		child classes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Protocols have features in common with abstract classes. The difference:
		With a protocol, we are only listing requirements, rather than
		implementations. For example, let's rewrite the code above as a protocol:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		protocol Animal {
			var name: String { get }
			init(name: String)
			required init(name: String) {
				self.name = name
			}
			func speak()
		}
		class Dog: Animal {
			let name: String
			var learnedTricks: Int
			init(name: String, learnedTricks: Int) {
				self.learnedTricks = learnedTricks
				self.name = name
			}
			func speak() {
				print("woof")
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Observe the first line of code inside the
		<span class="monoText">protocol</span>'s body. That line says, &#8220;For
		every animal, we can get its name.&#8221; Notice, however, that we do not
		indicate anything about how we get that name. We are leaving it entirely to
		the <span class="monoText">Animal</span> types to determine. Accordingly, we
		have to define how <span class="monoText">Dog</span> gets a name. That is
		done by removing the <span class="monoText">super.init</span> and writing a
		regular <span class="monoText">init</span> method. We remove the
		<span class="monoText">super.init</span> method because
		<span class="monoText">Dog</span> is now a base class.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, notice that the <span class="monoText">speak()</span> method inside
		the <span class="monoText">Animal</span> protocol does not contain a body.
		This is because protocol methods cannot have bodies. And since the protocol
		method doesn't have a body, we remove the
		<span class="monoText">override</span> keyword when we define the
		<span class="monoText">speak()</span> method inside
		<span class="monoText">Dog</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because a protocol imposes a requirement, every class that claims to
		<span class="term">conform</span> to a protocol must comply with that
		protocol's requirements. A class claims to conform to a protocol is
		indicated when we write <span class="monoText">${c}$: ${p,}$</span> where
		${c}$ is some class and ${p}$ is some protocol. E.g., when we wrote
		<span class="monoText">Dog: Animal</span>, we told Swift that
		<span class="monoText">Dog</span> conforms to the
		<span class="monoText">Animal</span> protocol. In doing so, we must ensure
		that the class conforms to the protocol's requirements. For example, if we
		wrote a second class called <span class="monoText">Cat</span> of type
		<span class="monoText">Animal</span>, failure to include the
		<span class="monoText">speak()</span> method will return an error. We must
		either define the method or remove our statement that
		<span class="monoText">Cat</span> conforms to the protocol
		<span class="monoText">Animal</span>. The same goes for all the other
		requirements. The protocol-conforming class must include the
		<span class="monoText">name</span> property, the
		<span class="monoText">init(name: String)</span> method, and the
		<span class="monoText">speak()</span> method.
	</p>
	<p>
		With protocols, we cannot instantiate the protocols directly. Instead, we
		must instantiate a class that confroms to that protocol. This is the key
		difference between classes and protocols. We can instantiate a class, even
		if the class is an abstract class &mdash; a class never intended to be
		directly instantiated. With a protocol, we can rest assured that the intent
		is always satisfied, because protocols can never be instantiated directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic" id="protocol_inheritance">Protocol Inheritance.</span>
		Protocols can inherit from another protocol. And, even more strikingly,
		protocols can inherit from more than one protocol. In other words, protocols
		are Swift's way of providing
		<span class="term">multiple inheritance</span> &mdash; a feature explicitly
		denied for all other named types.
	</p>
	<p>
		Closely related to this feature are <span class="term">extensions</span>. An
		extension allows us to write properties and methods beyond what was
		initially provided in the parent named type. We say parent named type
		because we can write extensions for structures, classes, enumerations, and
		protocols. With protocols, however, extensions have an additional feature:
		<span class="term">default implementations</span>.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		protocol Animal {
			var name: String { get }
			init(name: String)
			func birth()
		}
		protocol Mammal: Animal { }
		extension Mammal {
			func birth() {
				birth("live birth")
			}
		}
		protocol Reptile: Animal { }
		extension Reptile {
			func birth() {
				print("eggs layed")
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the code above, we created two protocols,
		<span class="monoText">Mammal</span> and
		<span class="monoText">Reptile</span>, that inherit from
		<span class="monoText">Animal</span>. Then, we created two extensions for
		<span class="monoText">Mammal</span> and
		<span class="monoText">Reptile</span>. We can then use the protocols
		<span class="monoText">Mammal</span> and
		<span class="monoText">Reptile</span> on classes, say
		<span class="monoText">Crocodile</span> and
		<span class="monoText">Kangaroo</span>, so long as those classes conform to
		the respective protocols. Assuming the classes conform to the protocols, all
		extensions of such protocols are available for the classes to use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Protocol inheritance is what allows us to write more flexible data types.
		Class inheritance is fairly restrictive, in that we do not have multiple
		inheritance. There are situations, however, where multiple inheritance is
		the best approach. In those situations, protocols and extensions are what we
		should use.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic" id="extensions">Extensions.</span> Separately, we should
		be clear about what we can and cannot put in an extension. Extensions cannot
		have stored instance properties, and they cannot have required or designated
		initializers. They can, however, contain methods, computed properties,
		stored type properties, and convenience initializers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Extensions are a powerful feature for handling data types. For example,
		suppose we want to include with the base type
		<span class="monoText">Int</span> some functions for determining parity:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		extension Int {
			func isEven(_ value: Int) -> Bool {
				value % 2 == 0
			}
			func isOdd(_ value: Int) -> Bool {
				(value + 1) % 2 == 0
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As written above, these are methods, but we can turn them into computed
		properties:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		extension Int {
			var isEven: Bool {
				self.value % 2 == 0
			}
			var isOdd: Bool {
				(self.value + 1) % 2 == 0
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Both the properties <span class="monoText">isEven</span> and
		<span class="monoText">isOdd</span> can be accessed on any instance of
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>.
	</p>
