	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Swift Standard Library.</span> The
		<span class="italicsText">Swift Standard Library</span> is a library
		provided by default in Swift. It includes many of the data types we've seen
		&mdash; <span class="monoText">Int</span>,
		<span class="monoText">Double</span>, <span class="monoText">Float</span>,
		<span class="monoText">Bool</span>, etc. It also provides many useful
		methods like <span class="monoText">print()</span>. We will not cover the
		methods, classes, and structs provided by the standard library; there are
		simply too many to list. Swift's documentation covers these implementations
		in detail, and should always be the first course of reference when we are
		thinking of performing a particular computation. The documentation can be
		quickly accessed by holding down the option key and hovering over a
		particular line of code we seek more information on.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Swift Standard Library should always be checked whenever we are thinking
		of performing a particular complex computation that is routine among
		programs (e.g., rounding, generating a random number, etc.) Chances are,
		there is a method already written for whatever it is we are trying to
		compute.
