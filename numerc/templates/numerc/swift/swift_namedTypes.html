	<h4>Named Types</h4>
	<p>
		In Swift, there are two kinds of types &mdash;
		<span class="term">named types</span> and
		<span class="term">compound types</span>. A
		<span class="italicsText">named type</span> is a type that has a
		<span class="italicsText">name</span> when it's defined. Swift provides four
		named types &mdash; <span class="monoText">struct</span> (structures),
		<span class="monoText">class</span>,
		<span class="monoText">enum</span> (enumerations), and
		<span class="monoText">protocol</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The built-in types we've encountered so far are actually named types &mdash;
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>, <span class="monoText">String</span>,
		<span class="monoText">Bool</span>, <span class="monoText">Array</span>,
		<span class="monoText">Dictionary</span>, <span class="monoText">Set</span>,
		etc.
	</p>

	<p>
		In contrast to named types, a
		<span class="italicsText">compound type</span> has a
		<span class="italicsText">type signature</span> when it's defined. A
		<span class="italicsText">tuple</span> in Swift is a compound type. For
		example, the tuple <span class="monoText">(1, 2, 3)</span> has the type
		signature <span class="monoText">(Int, Int, Int)</span>. The tuple
		<span class="monoText">("Logged in", true)</span> has the type signature
		<span class="monoText">(String, Bool)</span>. The tuple
		<span class="monoText">(true, (1, 1.18))</span> has the type signature
		<span class="monoText">(Bool, (Int, Double))</span>. In Swift,
		<span class="italicsText">functions</span> are a compound type. We explore
		functions in the next section.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition to the distinction between named types and compound types, types
		are also distinguished between <span class="term">value types</span> and
		<span class="term">reference types</span>. Value type determines
		<span class="italicsText">how a datum is stored</span>, and reference type
		determines <span class="italicsText">how a datum is copied</span>. So far,
		much of the types we've worked with are value types.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var x = 0
		var y = x
		y = 1
		var isXequaltoY = (x == y)
		print(isXequaltoY)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		false
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In the code above, we created an instance of the value type
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>, namely <span class="monoText">x</span>,
		with the value <span class="monoText">0</span>. Then, we assigned that
		instance, <span class="monoText">x</span>, to the instance
		<span class="monoText">y</span>. Both <span class="monoText">x</span> and
		<span class="monoText">y</span> are completely independent (this should look
		familiar to those coming from Java). When we wrote
		<span class="monoText">y = 1</span>, both
		<span class="monoText">x</span> and <span class="monoText">y</span> no
		longer match. Why? Because they are now instances of a different value type.
		The types <span class="monoText">struct</span> and
		<span class="monoText">tuple</span> are value types.
	</p>

	<p>
		Reference types are something entirely different. With a reference type, the
		two instances are both <span class="italicsText">referencing</span> the same
		data. This means that if make a change to one instance, we make a change to
		the other instance. In Swift, a <span class="monoText">class</span> and a
		<span class="monoText">function</span> are examples of reference types.
