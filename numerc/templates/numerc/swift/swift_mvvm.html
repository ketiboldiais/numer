<h1>MVVM</h1>
<section id="mvvm">
	<p>
		As we've seen, Swift is a multiparadigm language. When it comes to program
		architecture, however, Swift follows a very specific model called
		<span class="term">MVVM</span> &mdash; Model-View-ViewModel. Before SwiftUI,
		programs followed the MVC (Model View Controller) model.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under MVVM (and MVC), the application's backend code, or logic, is called
		the <span class="term">Model</span>. The frontend code, or the user
		interface, is called the <span class="term">View</span>. These two bodies of
		code are separate and distinct.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose we're creating a hangman game. The game's View contains
		all the code for what is displayed to the user &mdash; the blocks for the
		letters, the to-be-hanged's gradual outline, the rope, the stage, perhaps an
		executioner, etc. The game's Model contains all the logic and data for the
		game &mdash; what happens when the user enters a letter, what happens when
		the user gets the word right or wrong, etc.
	</p>
	<blockquote>A View should be essentially stateless.</blockquote>
	<p>
		Because the Model handles all of the logic behind the program, the program's
		View should be essentially stateless. One way to think about this is that
		the View should &#8220;stupid.&#8221; It knows nothing, a mindless entity
		that simply carries out the instruction's its fed.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Swift development, the Model is completely independent of the View. We
		can see this to be case when we open a model file in Swift &mdash; there is
		no SwiftUI import. The Model is where we place all source code dictating
		what the application does &mdash; the data the application uses, and what
		application does with data. In contrast, the view is how we present the
		application to the user. The model is the single source of truth for the
		application. We never place any decision-making in the view. All decisions
		are made by the model; the view is simply there to ask questions. We can
		think of it as, the view is just a nice, pretty shell; the actual brains
		behind everything is in the model.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last sentence highlights a key point about the view. The view is always
		a reflection of the current state of the model. In other words, the view is
		a <span class="underlineText">read-only</span> entity. Everything the view
		needs or uses comes from the model. The benefit to adhering to the doctrine
		of separating model and view is that it ensures we do not have to worry
		about two different states staying in sync. Indeed, a common pitfall in
		application development is failing to keep the user interface in sync with
		the implementation. Swift tackles this problem by forcing us to separate the
		two at all times.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because views are always a reflection of the model, the view is effectively
		stateless. But, this doesn't mean that views never have states. Often, state
		variables are used to allow the view to manage itself. For example, we might
		have an game application that changes its theme in response to certain
		holidays &mdash; a theme for Fourth of July, Chuseok, Hannukah, Easter, etc.
		These types of changes concern only user interface, so we would want to keep
		those in the view, and they will need state variables.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writing Swift views, we might notice that the source code looks an awful lot
		like declarative programming. And in fact, it is a form of declarative
		programming. In a view, we have the <span class="monoText">body var</span>.
		That <span class="monoText">body var</span> contains all the source code
		that determines what that particular view looks like, and it is rebuilt
		every time we call the <span class="monoText">body var</span>. This is
		exactly declarative programming. We aren't telling Swift
		<span class="italicsText">how</span> to build the view, we are merely
		stating <span class="italicsText">what</span> the view must look like. This
		is very different from imperative programming, where we are explicitly
		telling the language's interpreter or compiler how to perform a given
		computation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem with keeping all of the source code inside a
		<span class="monoText">body var</span> is that every change made in the
		model would require rebuilding the entire view over and over again. This is
		painfully inefficient. The solution: MVVM. We rebuild a view
		<span class="underlineText">only if</span> there is something in the view
		affected by the change in the model. This principle embodies reactive
		programming &mdash; some part of the programming is always reacting to
		another part of the program. At its core, this is what MVVM is all about:
		Separating the model from the view, while ensuring that a change in the view
		is triggered only by a specific change in the model.
	</p>
	<p>
		What is that &#8220;ensures&#8221; that last part? It's the
		<span class="term">ViewModel</span>. The ViewModel is what
		<span class="term">binds</span> the view to the model. As long as a view is
		bound to a particular model, the view will react to changes in that model,
		rebuilding when necessary. Otherwise, no such rebuilding occurs. The
		ViewModel works because of a foundational rule in MVVM: The view obtains
		data from the model <span class="underlineText">only if</span> it requests
		that data. By ensuring that the view must ask for it first, Swift ensures
		that not every change in the model results in completely rebuilding the
		view.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make this process even more efficient, the ViewModel constantly listens
		to changes in the model. As soon as a change occurs, the ViewModel records
		the fact &mdash; something has changed. That record is available for all the
		views to see. The ViewModel never actually sends this record to a view. It
		merely announces it to all the views. This is because the ViewModel is
		supposed to be in between the model and the view &mdash; it does not want to
		have any specific connections to the view. This is crucial point to
		understand. The ViewModel does not know anything about a view. The views,
		however, are <span class="term">subscribed</span> to what the ViewModel
		publishes, or records. If it sees a record that affects it, the View
		automatically rebuilds. The fact that the view is always subscribed to the
		ViewModel's publications or announcements, constantly reading, is how the
		view stays in sync with the model.
	</p>
	<p>
		Question: What about the other direction? How does the model receive data
		like user inputs or touch gestures? Again, the ViewModel plays a role. The
		ViewModel has another job called
		<span class="term">intent processing</span>. When the user makes some sort
		of change, e.g., a tap or a text input, the View calls an
		<span class="term">intent function</span>. That intent function then returns
		modification code, which the ViewModel sends to the model.

<section id="swift_type_system">
	<h4>The Swift Type System</h4>
	<p>
		There are 6 major types in Swift: classes, structures, enumerations,
		protocols, functions, and generics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Structures and classes are very similar, and they are essentially written
		with the same syntax. Both structures and classes can have stored variables
		(also called stored properties). These are variables directly stored in
		memory. Both can also contain computed variables (i.e., computed
		properties). These are variables whose value is computed from specific
		source code. Structures and classes can also contain constants &mdash;
		immutable variables. Finally, we can include functions in either classes or
		variables.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, both structures and classes have
		<span class="term">initializers</span>. These are special functions that
		create <span class="term">instances</span> of the structure or class.
		Although they are functions, we indicate initializers with just the word
		<span class="monoText">init</span>; Swift knows that initializers are
		functions. Initializers are everywhere in Swift development. For example, we
		might have a game, and to create a new session of the game, we call an
		<span class="monoText">init</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		More likely than not, the Views we create and use in Swift are the result of
		an <span class="monoText">init</span> function:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		struct RoundedRectangle {
			init(cornerRadius: CGFloat) {
				// some code
			}
			init(cornerSize: CGSize) {
				// some code
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		There are, however, some fairly large differences between
		<span class="monoText">structs</span> and
		<span class="monoText">classes</span>. The biggest difference: A
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> is a
		<span class="term">value type</span> and a
		<span class="monoText">class</span> is a
		<span class="term">reference type</span>. A value type is a type whose
		values are passed with <span class="italicsText">copies</span> of that
		value. So, let's say we create an instance called
		<span class="monoText">x</span> of some
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> called
		<span class="monoText">Foo</span>. When pass
		<span class="monoText">x</span> around our program, e.g., by passing it into
		a function, we are passing a copy of <span class="monoText">x</span>. These
		copies &mdash; and all instances of a value type &mdash; live in the
		<span class="term">stack</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast: A reference type is a type where values are passed with
		<span class="italicsText">pointers</span>. A value of reference type resides
		in the <span class="term">heap</span>, and when we instantiate a reference
		type, we create a pointer to that value in the heap. This might make us
		think that we should always use a
		<span class="monoText">class</span> instead of a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, since there is only one value of a
		<span class="monoText">class</span> in memory. This is wrong. Swift's
		designers implemented with <span class="monoText">struct</span> a feature
		called <span class="term">copy-on-write</span>: We never actually make or
		get a copy unless we modify the original.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what about a <span class="monoText">class</span>? What if we have too
		many pointers? Is there garbage collection? Swift does something better
		&mdash; <span class="term">automatic reference counting</span>. Swift keeps
		track of how many things are pointing to the reference type value in the
		heap, and as soon as that number goes to zero &mdash; i.e., there is nothing
		pointing to the value &mdash; Swift removes the reference type value from
		memory.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another big difference: <span class="monoText">structs</span> have no notion
		of inheritance. The <span class="monoText">struct</span> is a type closely
		tied to functional programming, and in functional programming, inheritance
		isn't something we're usually concerned with. That is very much an
		object-oriented programming notion, and for that reason, is closely tied to
		<span class="monoText">classes</span>. Something similar, however, exists
		for both <span class="monoText">structs</span> and
		<span class="monoText">classes</span>, namely
		<span class="monoText">protocols</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another difference between <span class="monoText">classes</span> and
		<span class="monoText">structs</span> are their default initializers. In
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>, the default
		<span class="monoText">init</span> requires initializing all the
		<span class="monoText">struct</span>'s properties. In a
		<span class="monoText">class</span>, the default
		<span class="monoText">init</span> does not initialize any of the
		<span class="monoText">class</span>'s properties. In both cases, when we
		write our own <span class="monoText">init</span>, we replace the default
		<span class="monoText">init</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next: Mutability. In a <span class="monoText">struct</span>, any attempt to
		mutate the <span class="monoText">struct</span>'s properties must be
		explicit. For example, if a <span class="monoText">struct</span> has some
		property called <span class="monoText">isEven</span>, that property must be
		declared with a <span class="monoText">var</span> to ensure subsequent
		mutation. With <span class="monoText">classes</span>, however, everything is
		always mutable. More often than not,
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> properties are declared with
		<span class="monoText">let</span>. This is because we usually do not want
		mutable structures &mdash; if we want mutability, that's a job best left to
		a <span class="monoText">class</span>. In Swift,
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> is the preferred named type. This is
		because Swift has a strong emphasis on functional programming, with
		object-oriented programming designated for certain situations, such as the
		ViewModel.
