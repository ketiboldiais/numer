	<h4>Optionals</h4>
	<p>
		Suppose we created a program that stores a user's
		<span class="monoText">firstName</span> and
		<span class="monoText">lastName</span>. Now suppose that the program uses
		these two variables extensively. What happens when these variables are
		uninitialized and operations are performed on them? Performing operations on
		uninitialized values almost always causes an error to return. So, we need to
		somehow initialize these values. One approach would be to use some sort of
		<span class="italicsText">dummy value</span>. Maybe an empty string, or the
		Boolean false.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>A value that represents a special condition (e.g., the absence of a
			value) is more generally called a
			<span class="term">sentinel value</span>. For example, in the C language
			family, <span class="monoText">0</span> is often used to indicate that a
			program ran successfully (one special condition), and subsequent numbers
			indicate a particular error (other special conditions). These numbers are
			sentinel values.</span
		>
		But this is not always best practice, because these values do not directly
		represent the information &mdash; the information simply is not there. The
		solution to this problem is to use an
		<span class="term">optional data type value</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		An <span class="term">optional</span> is a data type that represents (1)
		some value or (2) the absence of a value, the special value
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>. The type aims to represent information
		that has two states (1) existing, or (2) non-existing. For example, we might
		have information where: If the information exists, it is represented as an
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>; otherwise, it has no representation.
		Optionals are intended to address the problems that arise when there is no
		value. Older languages like C and Objective-C are not particularly
		user-friendly at handling these situations, and Swift addresses these
		shortcomings with optionals. Optionals are a way of ensuring we always have
		some &#8220;box&#8221; where a value can be stored. The box can contain a
		value (called a <span class="term">some-value</span>), or it contains
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>. Regardless, the box is always there.
	</p>

	<p>
		Optionals all have a type. If the optional's
		<span class="italicsText">some-value</span> is an
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>, then the optional has a data type
		<span class="monoText">Optional Int</span> &mdash; there's an
		<span class="monoText">Int</span> or there's no
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>. If the some-value is a
		<span class="monoText">String</span>, then the optional has a data type
		<span class="monoText">Optional String</span> &mdash; there's a
		<span class="monoText">String</span> or there's no
		<span class="monoText">String</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, for example, suppose we had a variable named
		<span class="monoText">favoriteSong</span>. Now, many people do not have a
		single favorite movie, so we want to ensure the possibility of a user not
		inputting a value for <span class="monoText">favoriteSong</span>. We declare
		the value as an optional:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var favoriteSong: String?
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		If we do not initialize <span class="monoText">favoriteSong</span>, the
		default value for <span class="monoText">favoriteSong</span> is
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>. Once a value is assigned to
		<span class="monoText">favoriteSong</span>, however, the variable now
		contains a some-value:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var favoriteSong: String?
		favoriteSong = "Benny and the Jets"
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Notice the output of printing <span class="monoText">favoriteSong</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var favoriteSong: String?
		favoriteSong = "Benny and the Jets"
		print(favoriteSong)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Optional("Benny and the Jets")
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Optionals are most apparent when we attempt to cast from one type to
		another:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"
		let stringToInt = Int(inputNum)
		print(type(of: stringToInt))
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Optional&lt;Int&gt;
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		We can check the type of a particular object with
		<span class="monoText">type(of: ${obj.}$)</span>, where ${obj.}$ is the
		relevant object. Here, we see that
		<span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> is a value of type
		<span class="monoText">Optional&lt;Int&gt;</span> (alternatively,
		<span class="monoText">Int?</span>). This tells us that
		<span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> is either (a) a value of type
		<span class="monoText">Int</span>, or (b) value does not exist.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic"><span class="monoText">nil</span>.</span> If we have an
		<span class="monoText">optional</span> value, we can set the value to its
		absent-value state by assigning it the value
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"

		var stringToInt = Int(inputNum)
		print(stringToInt)
		
		stringToInt = nil
		print(stringToInt)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Optional(10)
		nil
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Before we assigned <span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> the value
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>,
		<span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> contained the actual
		<span class="monoText">Int</span> value <span class="monoText">10</span>.
		However, after we assigned it <span class="monoText">nil</span>,
		<span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> evaluated to its absent-value
		state.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Unwrapping Options.</span> A word of caution: If a value
		is an <span class="monoText">Optional</span> type value and we want to
		perform certain operations on the present-value state's value, it must be
		explicitly <span class="term">unwrapped</span> into the relevant type. This
		is because the compiler does not actually know if the optional has a value.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"
		var stringToInt = Int(inputNum)

		// This returns an error
		print(stringToInt + 1)
	</code></pre>

	<p>To unwrap an optional, we have several options:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Force unwrapping</li>
		<li>Existence testing</li>
		<li>Optional binding</li>
		<li>Guarding</li>
		<li>Nil coalescing</li>
		<li>Implicit unwrapping</li>
	</ol>

	<p>We cover each in turn.</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Force Unwrapping.</span> Force unwrapping is the most
		dangerous way to unwrap an optional. If the optional is actually
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>, then we get an error. What's worse is
		that this error occurs at runtime, so the compiler won't catch it. Here is
		an example of force unwrapping in Swift:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"
		var stringToInt = Int(inputNum)
		print(stringToInt! + 1)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		11
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		To force unwrap, we append an exclamation mark,
		<span class="monoText">!</span>, to the end of the optional type variable
		and do nothing else. The force unwrap is not the fact that we append the
		question mark. It's the fact that we aren't first checking whether
		<span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> is
		<span class="monoText">nil</span>. We should avoid this practice like the
		plague. This is because if <span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> so
		happens to be <span class="monoText">nil</span>, we get a runtime error:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"
		var stringToInt = Int(inputNum)

		// some code leads to this mutation
		stringToInt = nil

		// this will give us a runtime error
		print(stringToInt! + 1)
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Existence Testing.</span>
		Why are runtime errors so dangerous? Because they aren't spotted by XCode as
		we write, and they aren't spotted by the compiler. This means the error can
		lay in ambush for a long time as we code, and only when we execute does it
		appear. A much safer way is to first test for existence:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"
		var stringToInt = Int(inputNum)
		if stringToInt != nil {
			print(stringToInt! + 1)
		} else {
			print("No value")
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		11
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Obviously, the problem with existence-testing is that we have to remember to
		check for <span class="monoText">nil</span> everytime we want to unwrap an
		optional. This is tedious. A better approach is
		<span class="italicsText">optional binding</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Optional Binding.</span> Another way to unwrap is to
		first determine whether the optional contains a value, and if it does, make
		the value available as a temporary constant or variable.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let inputNum = "10"
		var stringToInt = Int(inputNum)
		if let temp = stringToInt {
				let result = temp + 1
				print(result)
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		11
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		In an optional binding, we write an
		<span class="monoText">if-let</span> expression (or, alternatively, an
		<span class="monoText">if-var</span> expression). The last code block above
		tells Swift, "If <span class="monoText">stringToInt</span> contains a value:
		Unwrap it, assign it to a variable called
		<span class="monoText">temp</span>, then execute this block of code."
		Optional bindings are the preferred method for unwrapping optionals. Swift
		allows <span class="term">shadowing</span>, and it's often best practice to
		write <span class="monoText">if-let</span> statements using the same names
		for the <span class="monoText">let</span> expression and the optional
		variable:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var greet: String?
		greet = "Hello"
		print(greet)

		if let greet = greet {
			print(greet)
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Optional("Hello")
		"Hello"
	</code></pre>

	<p>We can also unwrap multiple values at the same time:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var greet: String?
		var bid: String?
		greet = "Hi"
		bid = "Bye"
		print(greet)
		print(bid)

		if let greet = greet,
			 let bid = bid {
			print(greet)
			print(bid)
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Optional("Hi")
		Optional("Bye")
		Hi
		Bye
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Guards.</span> Suppose we have a function that checks
		whether a coupon a user enters is valid. We could just write a function that
		blindly checks if entered coupon is valid, but that function would assume
		that the user actually entered a coupon. If the user didn't enter a coupon,
		then the value of some variable <span class="monoText">coupon</span> would
		be best represented as <span class="monoText">nil</span>. This is a
		situation where want to use an optional.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		userEnteredCoupon: String?
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		Now, if we wanted to verify whether the user entered the coupon, we should
		use a function that takes the variable
		<span class="monoText">userEnteredCoupon</span> as an argument. But this is
		an optional String. Either the user entered a coupon, or they did not.
		Accordingly, we must unwrap the optional. With functions, we can do so with
		a <span class="monoText">guard</span>:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
	func isValidCoupon(_ coupon: String?) -> Bool {
		guard let couponEntered = coupon else {
			return false
		}
		if couponEntered == "FallSale" {
			return true
		} else { return false }
	}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The <span class="monoText">guard</span> works as such: If the user didn't
		enter a coupon, simply return <span class="monoText">false</span>. After
		all, if the user didn't enter a coupon value, then there is no valid coupon.
		If, however, the user did enter a coupon value, then we can check whether
		the coupon is valid. We can think of <span class="monoText">guard</span> as
		a way of guarding against <span class="monoText">nil</span>. We can place
		whatever code we want in the <span class="monoText">guard</span>'s
		<span class="monoText">else</span> block. That is the code the function will
		execute when an argument passed to it is <span class="monoText">nil</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the code above, the expression following
		<span class="monoText">guard</span> is called a
		<span class="term">guard expression</span>. Guard expressions can be
		optional bindings (as indicated in the example), or they can be Boolean
		expressions. The code inside the guard expression's
		<span class="monoText">else</span> block is the code executed when the
		condition is false. This code
		<span class="underlineText">must</span> return. If, however, the condition
		is true, then we move along the <span class="term">happy path</span> &mdash;
		the rest of the code (or more visually, the left hand side).
	</p>

	<p><span class="topic">Nil Coalescing.</span> In some situations, we might want an optional value's some-value under any circumstance, and if there is no some-value (<span class="monoText">nil</span>), we'll use a default value. This is where <span class="term">nil coalescing</span> is useful. For example, suppose we ask the user to enter their gender. We want the relevant variable to be of type <span class="monoText">optional</span>, since the user may or may not want to enter that value.</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var userInputGender: String?
	</code></pre>

	<p>Now, if the user enters some value, we want to use that immediately. Otherwise (in the case of <span class="monoText">nil</span>) we want to use a default value:</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		var userInputGender: String?
		var userGender = userInputGender ?? "N/A"
	</code></pre>

	<p>Nil coalescing occurs on the second line, where we use the <span class="italicsText">nil coalescing operator</span> (<span class="monoText">??</span>). The second line says, &#8220;<span class="monoText">userGender</span> will have either the value inside <span class="monoText">userInputGender</span>; otherwise, it has the value <span class="monoText">"N/A"</span>&#8221;.</p>


	<p>
		<span class="topic">Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals.</span> When we
		implicitly unwrap an optional, we declare an optional, initialize it to some
		value, then tell Swift, "This is an optional, but I'm letting you know now
		that it's free to unwrap later." For example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-swift"><code>
		let userInt: Int! = 1
		print(userInt)

		let implicitInt: Int = userInt
		print(implicitInt)
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Optional(1)
		1
	</code></pre>
