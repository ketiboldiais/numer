<h1>Object Oriented I: Ruby</h1>
<section id="preface">
	<p>
		In this volume, we explore object-oriented programming with Ruby. We saw
		object-oriented programming in the first volume of these serial,
		<a href="">Foundations I: Java</a>. We recommend working through that volume
		before proceeding to these materials.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ruby was born on February 24, 1993 (the official birthday of Ruby as
		provided by Ruby's documentation). Conceived by the Japanese computer
		scientist Yukihiro Matsumoto (known in Ruby circles as &#8220;Matz&#8221;)
		and his colleagues, Ruby is arguably even more object-oriented than
		languages like Java. Accordingly, it is one of the best languages for
		exploring and assessing object-oriented programming under heightened
		scrutiny.
	</p>
	<p>
		Matsumoto developed Ruby because of his dissatisfaction with the Perl
		programming language, and his view of Python not being object-oriented
		enough. Inspired by Smalltalk, Lisp, and Perl, Matsumoto wanted a language
		with certain criteria: (1) syntactically simple like Lisp; (2) truly
		object-oriented like Smalltalk; and (4) had practical utility like Perl. In
		examining Ruby, will see whether or not these criteria are met.
	</p>
	<p>
		Initially released in December 1996, Ruby steadily grew popular in Japan. By
		2000, it was more popular than Python in Japan. Ruby's growth, however,
		largely remained in Japan; Western programmers weren't particularly
		interested in picking up the language. This began to change in 2003, when
		the Danish programmer David Heinemeier Hansson encountered Ruby. Enticed by
		how concise yet expressive Ruby was, Hansson began using the language to
		develop the web framework for Basecamp (a project management application).
		Rather than keeping this framework proprietary, however, Hansson released it
		to the public &mdash; what we now know as
		<span class="term">Ruby on Rails</span> (or
		<span class="italicsText">Rails</span> for short).
	</p>
	<p>
		The framework quickly generated a community of Rails developers, cementing
		Ruby's place as a household name among programmers. Today, Ruby has a large
		community of developers, well-known for its motto
		<span class="italicsText">MINASWAN</span> (&#8220;Matz is nice and so we are
		nice&#8221; &mdash; a reference to Matsumoto's friendly and polite demeanor)<label for="ruby" class="margin-toggle"><sup></sup></label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="ruby" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />
		<span class="marginnote"
			>As evidence of this demeanor, the name &#8220;Ruby&#8221; was decided
			partly because one of Matsumoto's colleague's birthstone was a ruby.</span
		>.
