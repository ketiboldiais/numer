		The basics of Ruby are covered in this article. Ruby is a
		dynamically-typed object-oriented language. To start, we state some
		broad features of the Ruby language:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Ruby is a <i>pure</i> OOP language, in the sense that everything in
			Ruby is an object. Even numbers are objects.
		</li>
		<li>
			Every object has a <b>class</b> that determines the object's
			behavior. This is what we see in languages like Java. There are other
			OOP languages that are not class-based, like ruby.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ruby also has <b>mixins</b>, which look like a mixture of interfaces
			in Java and multiple inheritance in C++.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ruby has a feature called <b>reflection</b>, which allows us to
			inspect objects during runtime.
		</li>
		<li>
			Extreme dynamic typing: We can change classes during execution. This
			is in contrast to statically typed OOP languages like Java.
		</li>
		<li>
			The variety <b>blocks</b> and <b>libraries</b> leads to numerous
			closure idioms.
		</li>
		<li>
			Syntax, scoping, and semantics are premised on Ruby being a
			<i>scripting language</i>. There is no formal definition of a
			scripting language, but we'll see that there are some differences
			between scripting languages and languages like Java, C, Racket, and
			so on.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Object-oriented Terminology</h2>
	<p>
		Because of how pervasive object-oriented programming is, there's a
		significant amount of competing terminologies. The table below compares
		and contrasts some of the terms currently in use, along with a few
		examples in certain languages.

<section id="classes_and_objects">
	<h2>Class &amp; Objects</h2>
	<p>Ruby is governed by a few core rules:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>All values are references to objects.</li>
		<li>
			Objects communicate via <b>method calls</b>, also known as
			<b>messages</b>.
		</li>
		<li>Each object has its own <b>private state</b>.</li>
		<li>Every object is an instance of a <b>class</b>.</li>
		<li>
			An object's class defines its methods. This implies that the object's
			class determines the object's <b>behavior</b> &mdash; how the object
			handles method calls.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Languages like Java and C# follow all of the rules above except the
		first. These languages have values that are not objects (primitive
		types like <var>int</var> and <var>double</var>). Additionally, they
		allow objects to have <i>non-private state</i>; Ruby does not.
	</p>
	<p>Here is the basic syntax for defining a class in Ruby:</p>
	<ul class="syntax">
		<li>class <i>name</i> =</li>
		<ul>
			<li>def <i>method name 1</i> <i>method arguments 1</i></li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>expressions</i></li>
			</ul>
			<li>end</li>
			<li>def <i>method name 2</i> <i>method arguments 2</i></li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>expressions</i></li>
			</ul>
			<li>end</li>
			<li>${\vdots}$</li>
			<li>def <i>method name ${n}$</i> <i>method arguments ${n}$</i></li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>expressions</i></li>
			</ul>
			<li>end</li>
		</ul>
		<li>end</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<figure class="iblock">
		<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
			class Maths
				def square n
					n * n
				end
				def cube n
					n * n * n
				end
			end
	
			x = Maths.new
			square5 = x.square(5)
			puts square5		
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
			ruby test.rb
			25
		</code></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A few points to note about the code above. First, unlike languages like
		Haskell or Python, indentation doesn't impact Ruby's semantics. That
		said, in Ruby, it's considered good practice to indent.
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, Ruby doesn't require explicit delimiters like semicolons,
		unless we have different expressions on the same line. For example,
		writing:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
		def cube n n * n * n end
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		will result in an error. To get the code to work, we can (but
		shouldn't) write:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
		def cube n; n * n * n; end
	</code></pre>

	<section id="self">
		<h3>The self Keyword</h3>
		<p>
			In Ruby, objects can call their own methods with the keyword
			<var><mark>self</mark></var
			>. For example:
		</p>
		<figure class="iblock">
			<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
				class Maths
					def pi
						3.14
					end

					def circumference(r)
						2 * r * self.pi
					end
				end

				math = Maths.new
				x = math.circumference(5)
				puts x			
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
				ruby test.rb
				31.400000000000002
			</code></pre>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Notice how we used <var>self.pi</var> to refer to the method
			<var>pi</var>, which returns the value <var>3.14</var>. As syntactic
			sugar, Ruby allows us to omit the <var>self</var> keyword entirely.
			By default, Ruby assumes that if an object's method calls a method
			${m,}$ ${m}$ must be some method defined in the class. Thus, we get
			the same result if we leave out <var>self</var>:
		</p>
		<figure class="iblock">
			<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
				class Maths
					def pi
						3.14
					end

					def circumference(r)
						2 * r * pi
					end
				end

				math = Maths.new
				x = math.circumference(5)
				puts x			
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
				ruby test.rb
				31.400000000000002
			</code></pre>
		</figure>
	</section>

	<section id="method_chaining">
		<h3>Method Chaining</h3>
		<p>
			Using <var>self</var> alone tells Ruby that we're referring to the
			entire object.
		</p>
		<figure class="iblock">
			<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
			class Greet
				def m1
					puts "hello"
					self
				end

				def m2
					puts "bye"
					self
				end
			end

			x = Greet.new
			x.m1
			x.m2
			x.m1.m2
			x.m1.m2.m1
			x.m1.m2.m1.m2
		</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-12"><code>
			ruby greet.rb
			hello
			bye
			hello
			bye
			hello
			bye
			hello
			hello
			bye
			hello
			bye
		</code></pre>
		</figure>
		<p>
			This isn't entirely surprising. Since each of the methods returns an
			object &mdash; an instance of <var>Greet</var> &mdash; we have access
			to the methods. This is called <b>method chaining</b> or
			<b>cascading</b>.<sup></sup>
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Method chaining is found in many object-oriented languages,
				particularly in JavaScript libraries. For example, in D3, it's
				common to see the pattern:
			</p>
			<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
				svg.selectAll('rect')
					 .data(dataSet)
					 .enter()
					 .append('rect')
					 .attr('x', 50)
					 .attr('y', 50)
					 .attr('width', 150)
					 .attr('height', 80)
					 .attr('fill', 'pink')
					 .attr('stroke', 'red')
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				This programming style is achieved by having each method call
				return the keyword
				<var>this</var>, much like what we saw with returning the keyword
				<var>self</var> in Ruby.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section id="variables">
		<h3>Variables</h3>
		<p>
			Methods can use local variables. Variables in Ruby always start with
			a letter, and their scope is the method's body. From the earlier
			examples, we can see that we don't declare the variables. We can
			simply assign them anywhere inside the method's body.
		</p>
		<p>
			Variables in Ruby are mutable. Thus, we can write <var>x = 5</var>,
			then write <var>x = 6</var> later on.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="object_state">
		<h3>Object State</h3>
		<p>
			In Ruby, each object has its own state. That state starts the moment
			we create an object, and it persists across time, capable of growing
			and changing. Importantly, all object states in Ruby are private.
			This means that to directly access an object's state, the object must
			have some method for accessing its state. If we modify the object's
			state, that state persists as the object's state until we modify it
			again.
		</p>
		<p>
			An object's state consists of <b>instance variables</b> (also called
			<b>fields</b> or <b>properties</b>). To create a field, we define in
			the object's class a variable name, prepended with the
			<var><mark>@</mark></var> symbol. For example, suppose we wanted a
			class called <var>Circle</var>, where instance of
			<var>Circle</var> has a field called <var>radius</var>. To do so, we
			use the <var>initialize</var> keyword, with the field in its body:
		</p>
		<figure class="iblock">
			<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
				class Circle
					def initialize(r)
						@radius = r
						@pi = 3.14
					end

					def circumference
						2 * @pi * @radius
					end

					def area
						@pi * @radius * @radius
					end
				end

				circle1 = Circle.new(5)
				puts circle1.circumference
				puts circle1.area			
			</code></pre>
			<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,3"><code>
				ruby circle.rb
				31.400000000000002
				78.5				
			</code></pre>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The <var>initialize</var> method is a constructor. This method is
			executed when we use the <var>new</var> keyword, and its parameters
			are fulfilled with the arguments passed to <var>new()</var>. What
			happens if <var>radius</var> is not initialized? Ruby returns an
			error:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-bash"><code>
			Traceback (most recent call last):
				2: from circle.rb:27:in &grave;&lt;main&gt;&apos;
				1: from circle.rb:27:in `new'
			circle.rb:2:in `initialize': wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1) (ArgumentError)			
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			If we wanted to avoid this error, we can pass
			<i>default arguments</i> to the <var>initialize</var> method:
		</p>
		<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
			def initialize(r=1)
				@radius = r
			end			
		</code></pre>

		<section id="getters_and_setters">
			<h3>Getters &amp; Setters</h3>
			<p>
				Because all object states in Ruby are private, to <i>read</i> an
				object's field we need a <b>getter</b>, and to <i>write</i> the
				object's field we need a <b>setter</b>. These are just methods. For
				example, in our <var>Circle</var> class, we can read the
				<var>radius</var> field by writing:
			</p>
			<figure class="iblock">
				<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
					class Circle
						def initialize(r)
							@radius = r
							@pi = 3.14
						end

						def radius
							@radius
						end
	
						def circumference
							2 * @pi * @radius
						end
	
						def area
							@pi * @radius * @radius
						end
					end
	
					circle1 = Circle.new(5)
					puts circle1.radius
				</code></pre>
				<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2"><code>
					ruby circle.rb
					5
				</code></pre>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Above, we wrote a method <var>radius</var>, which takes no
				arguments and returns the <var>circle1</var>'s current
				<var>radius</var>. This is a <i>getter</i>. What if we wanted to
				change <var>circle1</var>'s <var>radius</var>? For that, we use a
				<i>setter</i>. In the code below, our setter is called
				<var>setRadius()</var>:
			</p>
			<figure class="iblock">
				<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
					class Circle
						def initialize(r)
							@radius = r
						end

						def setRadius(r)
							@radius = r
						end

						def radius
							@radius
						end

						def pi
							3.14
						end

						def circumference
							2 * pi * @radius
						end

						def area
							pi * @radius * @radius
						end
					end

					circle1 = Circle.new(5)
					puts circle1.radius
					circle1.setRadius(10)
					puts circle1.radius
				</code></pre>
				<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2,3"><code>
					ruby circle.rb
					5
					10
				</code></pre>
			</figure>
			<p>Alternatively, we could also written our setter as:</p>
			<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
				def radius=r
					@radius = r
				end				
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				Note that the whitespace in <var>radius=r</var> is significant.
				This tells Ruby that we're defining a particular method, namely, a
				setter.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="aliasing">
			<h4>Aliasing</h4>
			<p>
				The moment we create an object in Ruby using the
				<var>new</var> keyword, we create a reference to the new object.
				That object is <i>unique</i> &mdash; it's different from all other
				objects created. If, however, we assign the object to a variable,
				that variable becomes an <b>alias</b> of the object. And because
				it's an alias, both variable and the object's identifier refer to
				the same object. For example, consider the following code:
			</p>
			<figure class="iblock">
				<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
					circle1 = Circle.new(5)
					circle2 = circle1
					puts "circle1.radius: #{circle1.radius}"
					puts "circle2.radius: #{circle2.radius}"
					circle1.radius = 10
					puts "circle1.radius: #{circle1.radius}"
					puts "circle2.radius: #{circle2.radius}"
					circle2.radius = 17
					puts "circle1.radius: #{circle1.radius}"
					puts "circle2.radius: #{circle2.radius}"
				</code></pre>
				<pre class="language-bash command-line" data-output="2-7"><code>
					ruby circle.rb
					circle1.radius: 5
					circle2.radius: 5
					circle1.radius: 10
					circle2.radius: 10
					circle1.radius: 17
					circle2.radius: 17
				</code></pre>
			</figure>
		</section>

		<section id="class_variables">
			<h4>Class Variables</h4>
			<p>
				Ruby allows objects to share states. This is done through
				<b>class variables</b>. To indicate class variables, we use the
				syntax <var>@@</var>. For example, suppose we want our
				<var>Circle</var> class's <var>pi</var> field to always be
				<var>3.14</var>:
			</p>
			<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
				class Circle
					def initialize(r=1)
						@radius = r
						@@pi = 3.14   # class variable
					end

					def radius=r
						@radius = r
					end

					def radius
						@radius
					end

					def circumference
						2 * @@pi * @radius
					end

					def area
						@@pi * @radius * @radius
					end
				end				
			</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="class_constants">
			<h4>Class Constants</h4>
			<p>
				Alternatively, maybe we want non-instances to have access to
				<var>pi</var>. In that case, we would define <var>pi</var> as a
				<b>class constant</b>. To do so, we must start <var>pi</var> with
				an uppercase letter (<var>Pi</var>):
			</p>
			<figure class="iblock">
				<pre class="language-ruby"><code>
