<h1>Cryptography</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<u>C</u>ryptography is the practice and study of securing
		communications in the presence of third parties. Cryptography has a
		long and rich history. From Julius Caesar to the Navajo Code Talkers,
		so long as we've felt the need to keep communications private,
		cryptography sprung like Athena from Zeus's head. In the modern era,
		we've come to rely on cryptography for many of the things we take for
		granted: Transferring funds electronically, storing user information,
		signing contracts, assessing electronic evidence, securing medical
		records, emailing, text messaging, uploading files, downloading files,
		the list is endless. This article presents an overview of the
		fundamentals of cryptography by investigating standard techniques and
		practices.

	<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
	<p>To begin, we define a few pieces of basic terminology.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Plaintext</b> is the message to be encrypted.</li>
		<li><b>Ciphertext</b> is the message encrypted.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Encryption</b> is the process of encoding &mdash; whether it be
			scrambling, rewriting, symbol-rearranging, masking, etc. &mdash; a
			message in such a way that only the intended and authorized
			recipients can access the message.
		</li>
		<li><b>Decryption</b> is the process of decoding the message.</li>
		<li>
			The <b>key</b> is the sequence needed for both encryption and
			decryption.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		From a mathematical standpoint, cryptography can be viewed as the study
		of the relationship between two special functions (where ${\texttt{c}}$
		is the ciphertext, ${\texttt{p}}$ is the plaintext, and ${\texttt{k}}$
		is the key):
