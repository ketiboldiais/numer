	Binary trees are a core data structure behind much of the software
	products and services we use today: The most common use case is the
	<i>binary search tree</i>, used in numerous search applications where
	data is constantly ebbing and flowing in a given system.
	<i>Binary space partition</i> is used in nearly all 3D video games for
	determining which objects must be rerendered. <i>Binary tries</i> are
	used in nearly all high-bandwidth routers for storing
	<i>router-tables</i>, large address books that routers use to direct
	internet traffic. <i>Huffman coding trees</i> are binary trees used in
	compression algorithms, most notably the .jpeg and .mp3 file formats.
	<i>Syntax trees</i> are used by compilers and calculators to parse
	user-input expressions. The list goes on.
</p>

<p>
	Why are binary trees more commonly used than ternary trees or other
	${n}$-ary trees? Simply because ${n}$-ary trees are much more
	complicated. While we can do many interesting things with ${n}$-ary
	trees, we gain little in terms of speed. And as we know, speed is
	everything when it comes to data structures. Of course, ${n}$-ary trees
	outperform binary trees in certain situations, but the fact is, binary
	trees are easier to work with and cover more problem domains.

<p>
	So, what are binary trees, really? Binary trees are a special kind of
	tree. They consist of <i>nodes</i> in a <i>parent-child relationship</i>.
	All binary trees have a single root &mdash; what we might think of as the
	<i>first node</i>, just as Adam was the first man or Eve the first woman
	&mdash; from which all other nodes descend. Moreover, binary trees have a
	two-child policy &mdash; all nodes can have at most two children.
</p>
<p>
	Because of these properties, we say that all binary trees are trees, but
	not all trees are binary trees. Accordingly, we have at our disposal all
	the usual arboreal terms:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The <b>root</b> is the top, or first, node in the tree.</li>
	<li>A <b>child</b> is a node directly descending from a node.</li>
	<li>
		The <b>parent</b> of a node ${n}$ is the node ${n}$ descends from.
	</li>
	<li><b>Siblings</b> are nodes with the same parent.</li>
	<li>A <b>leaf</b> is a node with no children.</li>
	<li>A <b>fork</b> is a node with children.</li>
	<li>
		An <b>edge</b> is the connection between a child node and its parent.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, there are two approaches to implementing binary trees:</p>
<ol>
	<li>array implementation</li>
	<li>linked list implementation</li>
</ol>
<p>We begin first with the array implementation.</p>
