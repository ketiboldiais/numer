<p>
	To <i>traverse</i> a data structure is to visit, or read, all of the
	structure's elements. In a linear data structure like an array, there are
	two traversal approaches:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>first to last (called <b>forward-linear traversal</b>), or</li>
	<li>last to first (<b>backward-linear traversal</b>).</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Data structures like binary trees, however, are non-linear. And because
	they're non-linear, they have several traversal approaches:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Depth-first search (DFS)</b> &mdash; traversing the tree by starting
		at the root, and exploring as far as possible along each
		<i>branch</i> before backtracing.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Breadth-first search (BFS)</b> &mdash; traversing the tree by
		starting at the root, and exploring all nodes at the present level
		before moving to nodes at a subsequent level.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Both approaches have several sub-approaches:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Depth-first search:</li>
	<ol>
		<li><i>preorder traversal</i></li>
		<li><i>inorder traversal</i></li>
		<li><i>postorder traversal</i></li>
	</ol>
	<li>Bread-first search:</li>
	<ol>
		<li><i>level/generational traversal</i> and variations</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p>We examine each of these traversal approaches in turn.</p>
