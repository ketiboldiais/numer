<h3>Generational Traversal</h3>
<p>
	In <b>generational traversal</b>, also called
	<b>level-order traversal</b>, we traverse the tree generation by
	generation, from left to right.
</p>
<p>
	For example, for the binary tree below, we start at the first generation,
	which has only one node, the root ${n_a.}$
</p>
<div id="genverse_gen1"></div>
<p>Then we start at the next generation, visiting from the left:</p>
<div id="genverse_gen2_left"></div>
<p>to the right:</p>
<div id="genverse_gen2_right"></div>
<p>
	Hence, for generational traversal, we have the traversal sequence ${(n_a,
	n_b, n_c).}$ For a left-skewed tree, we have the traversal sequence
	${(n_a, n_b).}$
</p>
<div id="genverse_gen2_skew_left"></div>
<p>
	And for a right-skewed tree, we have the traversal sequence ${(n_a,
	n_c).}$
</p>
<div id="genverse_gen2_skew_right"></div>
