<p>We have the following tree:</p>
<div id="bst_delete_1"></div>
<p>
	Now suppose that we're asked to delete a node associated with a
	particular value in the tree. Call it the <i>target node</i>. How might
	we do so? Once again, because we know how to search for nodes, deleting
	is <i>almost</i> trivial, at least for tree's leaves. We just to search
	for the particular node containing the key, then delete if found. For
	the leaves, this is straightforward. If we wanted to delete the node
	containing <var>70</var>, we just have call
	<var>search(root, 70)</var>, then, when we get to <var>70</var>,
	delete:
</p>
<div id="bst_delete_2"></div>
<p>
	All that's left to do after deleting <var>node(70)</var> is to ensure
	its parent, <var>node(60)</var> has its left-child pointer set to
	<var>NULL</var>. Now, we emphasized <i>almost</i> trivial because
	there's a bit of a troublesome case: Deleting branch nodes. For
	example, suppose we were asked to delete the node containing
	<var>60</var>. If we just blindly deleted the node, we'd end up with:
</p>
<div id="bst_delete_3"></div>
<p>
	We've partitioned the tree, and that's likely not what we intended. But
	even if we did, assuming the only way to access the tree was through a
	single <var>root</var> pointer, the other tree &mdash;
	<var>node(55)</var> &mdash; is lost in memory; from a practical
	perspective, we've essentially destroyed it.
</p>
<p>
	To avoid this problem: Before deletion, always check if the target node
	is a branch node or a leaf node. If the target node is a branch node
	with only one child, as is the case with <var>node(60)</var>, then the
	target node must take its parent's place after deletion:
</p>
<div id="bst_delete_4"></div>
<p>
	This avoids partitioning, but only for deleting uniparous nodes. What
	if we were now asked to delete <var>node(50)</var>? Once again, blindly
	deleting causes a partition:
</p>
<div id="bst_delete_5"></div>
<p>
	There are several ways to avoid this problem. One way is to fill the
	newly-emptied position with the target node's
	<i>inorder predecesor</i>. In other words, fill the vacancy with the
	node that comes before the target node within the tree's inorder
	traversal sequence. For our tree above, the inorder traversal sequence
	is:
</p>
<figure>
	$$ \lang 10, 15, 20, 30, {\color{forestgreen}{40}},
	{\color{indianred}{50}}, {\color{dodgerblue}55} \rang $$
</figure>
<p>
	and we can see that <var>node(40)</var> comes before
	<var>node(50)</var>. Above, we've also indicated the blue-colored
	<var>node(55)</var>, <var>node(50)</var>'s <i>inorder successor</i>.
	Thus, if we delete a biparous node, we can choose either the inorder
	predecesor or the inorder successor to fill the vacancy:
</p>
<div class="col2">
	<figure class="block">
		<div id="bst_delete_inorder_predecesor"></div>
		<figcaption>Inorder predecesor succession.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="block">
		<div id="bst_delete_inorder_successor"></div>
		<figcaption>Inorder successor succession.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<p>
	Given the binary search tree's structure, finding either of these
	successors is easy enough, per the following lemmas:
</p>
<dfn>
	<small>definition: inorder predecesor</small>
	<p>
		Let ${N}$ be a node in a binary search tree ${B.}$ The
		<b>inorder predecesor</b> of ${N}$ is the rightmost child of ${B}$'s
		left subtree.
	</p>
</dfn>
<dfn>
	<small>definition: inorder successor</small>
	<p>
		Let ${N}$ be a node in a binary search tree ${B.}$ The
		<b>inorder successor</b> of ${N}$ is the leftmost child of ${B}$'s
		right subtree.
	</p>
</dfn>
<p>
	We call this vacancy-filling technique <i>inorder-succession</i>.
	Having given a broad overview of how the technique works, let's point
	out some of the flaws with this technique. First, suppose we had the
	following tree:
</p>
<div id="removal_degenerate_tree"></div>
<p>The inorder traversal squence for this tree is:</p>
<figure>$$ \lang 10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90 \rang $$</figure>
<p>
	If we deleted <var>node(20)</var> using inorder-successor-succession,
	then we suddenly have to perform several successions:
</p>

<p>Before deletion. No changes.</p>

<div>$$ \lang 10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90 \rang $$</div>
<div id="t1"></div>

<p>
	Remove <var>node(20)</var>. There's a vacancy that must be filled, and
	because we're using inorder-successor-succession,
	<var>node(30)</var> must rise to fill the vacancy. In this case, it
	becomes the left-child of <var>node(90)</var>.
</p>

<div>$$ \lang 10, 30, \square, 70, 80, 90 \rang $$</div>
<div id="t2"></div>

<p>
	The previous step results in a vacancy, and now
	<var>node(70)</var> must succeed.
</p>

<div>$$ \lang 10, 30, 70, \square, 80, 90 \rang $$</div>
<div id="t3"></div>

<p>Now <var>node(80)</var> must succeed.</p>

<div>$$ \lang 10, 30, 70, 80, \square, 90 \rang $$</div>
<div id="t4"></div>

<p>
	And finally, <var>node(90)</var> must succeed, which means
	<var>node(30)</var> must succeed.
</p>

<div>$$ \lang 10, 30, 70, 80, 90 \rang $$</div>
<div id="t5"></div>

<p>
	<span class="title"><b>time complexity.</b></span> Examining this
	process, we see that the time complexity for removing nodes depends on
	the tree's height. We must search &mdash; i.e., traverse &mdash; the
	tree and modify accordingly.
