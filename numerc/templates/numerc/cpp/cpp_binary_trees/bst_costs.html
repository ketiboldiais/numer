	As with all data structures, there are costs to binary search trees. The
	BST's most significant cost is the lack of control over order of
	insertion. For example, the following traversal sequences have the same
	keys, but generate two different trees:
</p>
<div>
	<figure class="block">
		<div id="bst_cost_arr1"></div>
		<div id="bst_cost_tree_1"></div>
		<figcaption>Tree ${\texttt{T}_1}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="block">
		<div id="bst_cost_arr2"></div>
		<div id="bst_cost_tree_2"></div>
		<figcaption>Tree ${\texttt{T}_2}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<p>
	Notice that ${\texttt{T}_1}$ has a height of ${2,}$ while
	${\texttt{T}_2}$ has a height of ${6.}$ Two different heights for the
	same set of keys! This shows that a BST's height depends on the order of
	key insertion.
</p>
<p>
	Can we control the order of insertion? With what we have so far, no.
	Ultimately, how the keys are inserted is up to the user. If the user
	inserts the keys according to ${\texttt{T}_1}$'s traversal sequence, then
	they'll get the tree ${\texttt{T}_1.}$ But if they insert the keys
	according to ${\texttt{T}_2}$ then they'll get the tree ${\texttt{T}_2.}$
</p>
<p>
	Because of this problem, we need a way to control the height of a binary
	search tree. Fortunately, there's a solution &mdash;
	<a href="">AVL trees</a>.
