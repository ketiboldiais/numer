	<h4>One-Dimensional Peak Finding</h4>
	<p>Suppose we have the following array:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an array with 9 elements, 9 indices (starting from 1). Suppose the
		elements ${a \ldots i}$ are numbers. We say that position 2 is a peak iff
		${b \geq a}$ and ${b \geq c.}$ Positions 1 and 9 are
		<span class="italicsText">edge cases</span>. Position 9 is a peak if ${i
		\geq h}$ and position 1 is a peak if ${a \geq b.}$ Now we are given the
		following problem:

			<p><span class="topic">Problem.</span> Find a peak, if it exists.</p>
