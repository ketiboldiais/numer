<h1>Algorithms for Strings</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">I</span>n this section, we present several useful
		algorithms for strings. As we know, a
		<span class="term">character set</span> is the set of character codes a
		language can process. Because computers only understand zeroes and ones,
		each character in the set is assigned an integer value, which can be
		represented in zeroes and ones. These codes are determined by an encoding
		standard. In languages like C, the the encoding standard is ASCII.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the ASCII characters, the encodings are the integers from ${0}$ to
		${127.}$ This is a total of ${128}$ unique encodings, thereby permitting the
		representation of ${128}$ unique characters. Because the highest possible
		integer representation is ${127}$ &mdash; in binary, ${111~1111_{[2]}}$
		&mdash; seven bits are sufficient for representing ${128}$ characters.
		However, because computer memory (RAM), is addressed by byte (eight bits), a
		minimum of 1 byte is allocated for the ASCII encoding &mdash; in C and C++,
		a <span class="monoText">char</span> value. Because every ASCII encoding
		requires exactly 1 byte, we say that ASCII uses a
		<span class="term">fixed-width encoding system</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a good point to introduce an important distinction: There's a
		difference between the character set (ASCII) and the character set's
		<span class="term">encoding system</span>. The encoding system is the way
		the characters in the set are represented in memory. In ASCII, characters
		are encoded as seven-bit character codes, as we stated earlier. There are,
		however, other encoding systems:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In <span class="boldText">UTF-32</span>,<label
				for="utf"
				class="margin-toggle"
				><sup></sup
			></label>
			<input type="checkbox" id="utf" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />
			<span class="marginnote"
				>&#8220;UTF&#8221; stands for &#8220;Unicode Transformation
				Format.&#8221;</span
			>
			all characters are encoded as a sequence of 32-bits (4 bytes). As such,
			UTF-32 is a fixed-width encoding system. Although many more characters can
			be represented with 32 bits, it leads to a significant amount of wasted
			memory. For example, the character <span class="monoText">A</span> in
			ASCII is:
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${0100~0001_{[2]}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			And in UTF-32:
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${0000~0000~~~0000~0000~~~0000~0000~~~0100~0001_{[2]}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</li>
		<li>
			In contrast, <span class="boldText">UTF-16</span>, is a
			<span class="term">variable-width encoding system</span>. Characters are
			encoded as either a sequence of 16 bits (2 bytes), or a sequence of 32
			bits (4 bytes). For example, since the character
			<span class="monoText">A</span> is an ASCII character, and we only need 1
			byte for representation, UTF-16 uses 2 bytes instead of four:
		</li>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${0000~0000~~~0100~0001_{[2]}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<li>
			<span class="boldText">UTF-8</span> is also a variable-width encoding
			system. Characters are encoded as a sequence of 32, 16, 24, or 1 byte (8
			bits). Thus, with the character <span class="monoText">A</span>, only one
			byte is needed, so 1 byte is used:
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${0100~0001_{[2]}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The predominant character set today is
		<span class="term">Unicode</span>.<label for="unicode" class="margin-toggle"
			><sup></sup
		></label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="unicode" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />
		<span class="marginnote"
			>The name &#8220;Unicode&#8221; is a morphological blending of
			<span class="italicsText">unique</span>,
			<span class="italicsText">unified</span>,
			<span class="italicsText">universal</span>, and
			<span class="italicsText">encoding</span>.</span
		>
		As of this writing, Unicode is currently at version 14.0, comprising
		${144~697}$ characters, with ${1~112~064}$ code points in reserve.
