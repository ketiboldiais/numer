	In the previous sections, we worked exclusively with arrays. Arguably,
	the largest limitation we saw with arrays is the fact that they were of
	fixed size. Whenever we create an array, we must provide a size. And if
	we do not, the compiler will do so for us. Once set, the array's size is
	fixed &mdash; we cannot lengthen or shorten the array.
</p>
<p>
	Because of the length limitation, we cannot modify the array at runtime.
	This makes it prohibitively difficult to work with sequences whose sizes
	are unknown at the time of writing. Of course, we could always just
	initialize massive arrays, hoping that our sequences can fit. But this is
	clearly inefficient &mdash; it's a waste of memory. And even if we went
	with this approach, there's no guarantee that our sequence would fit the
	monolithic array.

	The linked list corresponds to the abstract data type <b>list</b>.<sup
	></sup> A list has the following traits:
</p>
<div class="note">
	<p>
		In these materials, we make a distinction between the abstract data
		type
		<i>list</i> and the abstract data type <i>sequence</i>. The static
		arrays we worked with earlier correspond to the abstract data type
		<i>sequence</i>.
	</p>
</div>
<ol>
	<li>
		A list can store any given number of elements of a given data type
		${t.}$
	</li>
	<li>A list's elements can be written or modified in place.</li>
	<li>A list has a specified data type ${L_t.}$</li>
	<li>A list's elements can be read.</li>
	<li>A list can be traversed.</li>
	<li>Elements in a list can be enumerated.</li>
	<li>The empty list has a size of ${0.}$</li>
	<li>An element can be inserted at <em>any</em> position in the list.</li>
	<li>An element can be removed at <em>any</em> position in the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The first seven properties above are all properties present in the
	<i>sequence</i> ADT. It is the last two properties that differentiate
	lists from sequences. Sequences are implemented as static arrays. And as
	static arrays, they have a <em>fixed size</em>. The list, however, has a
	<i>dynamic size</i>. They can grow and shrink as we please.
</p>
<p>Listing some of the differences between arrays and linked lists:</p>
<div id="compare_linkedlists_and_arrays"></div>
<p>
	In the map above, green indicates that the operation is efficient. For
	both static and dynamic arrays, indexing and random access are fast.
	These operations, however, do not exist for linked-lists (hence the grey
	color). Where the singly-linked list outshines dynamic and static arrays
	is in insertion and deletion. Both dynamic arrays and linked lists have
	variable size.
</p>
<p>
	Comparing arrays and linked lists, it's helpful to visualize how they
	might be stored in memory. Suppose we had the following sequence:<sup
	></sup>
</p>
<div class="note">
	<p>With sequences, we used the notation:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\lang n_0, n_1, n_2, \ldots n_i \rang}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${n}$ is some element. For lists, we will use the following
		notation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(n_0, n_1, n_2, \ldots n_i)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</div>
<figure>
	<div>
		<p>${\lang 3, 7, 2, 9, 1 \rang}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>
<p>
	From what we know, we can implement this sequence in three ways: (1) a
	static array; (2) a dynamic array; and (3) a linked list. Compare these
	three approaches from a computer memory perspective:

		To remove a node ${x_n,}$ we would simply have the pointer for the node

	</p> -->
<p>Here's a closer look at the linked list:</p>
<div id="LLintro"></div>
<p>
	In the diagram above, each of the boxes are called <b>nodes</b>. A linked
	list node consists of two parts: (1) substantive data and (2) procedural
	data. The <b>substantive data</b> consists of the actual data we want to
	work with. This could be some literal, an array, or some instance of an
	abstract data type. The <b>procedural data</b> consists of a
	<i>pointer</i>. That pointer points to the next node. Note what this
	means:
</p>
<figure>
	<div>
		<p>A node pointer is of type node.</p>
	</div>
</figure>
<p>
	Recognizing this point, a node is itself a data structure, albeit simple:
</p>
<figure>
	<img
		src="{% static 'images/nodeDataStructure.svg' %}"
		alt="node data structure"
		loading="lazy"
		class="thirty-p"
	/>
</figure>
<p>
	<span class="topic">Notation.</span> In these materials, we use a
	particular syntax to refer to individual nodes. Suppose we had the
	following linked list:
</p>
<div id="LL_notation"></div>
<p>
	When we write ${r,}$ we are referring to the pointer to the first node in
	the list. When we write ${h,}$ or ${n_1,}$ we are referring to the first
	node in the list. And when we write ${t,}$ or ${n_\ell,}$ we are
	referring to the last node in the list, the tailend.
</p>
<p>
	When we refer to the data value of a particular node, say the second
	node, we write:
</p>
<figure>
	<div>
		<p>${\large (n \mid D:5)}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>
<p>or, alternatively:</p>
<figure>
	<div>
		<p>${\large (n_2 \mid D)}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>
<p>
	When we're referring to the node's pointee &mdash; the address inside the
	particular node's <var>next</var> field &mdash; we write:
</p>
<figure>
	<div>
		<p>${\large (n_2 \mid N)}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>
