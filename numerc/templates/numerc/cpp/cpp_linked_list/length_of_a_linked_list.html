<h2>Length of a Linked List</h2>
<p>
	One particularly useful operation is to count the number of nodes in a
	linked list. This will return the <b>length</b> of a linked list. Say we
	had the following linked list:
</p>
<div id="ll_length"></div>
<p>Implementing the linked list above:</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;

		struct Node {
			int data;
			Node* next;
		};
		
		Node* newNode(int data) {
			Node* node       = new Node;
			      node->data = data;
			      node->next = 0;
			return node;
		}
		
		int main() {
			Node* root = 0;            // create root
			Node* n1   = newNode(8);   // create nodes
			Node* n2   = newNode(3);
			Node* n3   = newNode(7);
			Node* n4   = newNode(12);
			Node* n5   = newNode(9);
		
			root     = n1;  // link nodes
			n1->next = n2;
			n2->next = n3;
			n3->next = n4;
			n4->next = n5;
			n5->next = 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
<p>
	There are five nodees in the linked list. Thus, we should expect our
	count to return 5.
</p>
<p>
	Counting the number of nodes in a linked list is similar to counting the
	number of elements in an array. We can do so iteratively with a
	<b>count</b> variable:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		int length(Node* p) {
			int count = 0;
			while(p != 0) {
				count++;
				p = p->next;
			}
			return count;
		}
	</code></pre>
<p>
	The time complexity for this procedure is straightforward. We're
	traversing through ${n}$ nodes, incrementing <var>count</var>. Hence, we
	have a time complexity of ${O(n).}$
</p>
<p>
	And the space complexity? Constant. This is a single function call, and
	each of the variables used take a fixed amount of memory. Accordingly,
	this approach has a space complexity of ${O(1).}$
</p>
<p>
	<span class="topic">Recursive Implementation.</span> As always, we can
	implement the same function recursively:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		int length(Node* p) {
			if (p == 0) {
				return 0;
			} else {
				return length(p->next) + 1;
			}
		}
	</code></pre>
<p>
	As with all recursive functions, we start with a base case. The base case
	is a list of length ${0}$ &mdash; ${P(0),}$ the empty list. If the list
	contains one element, then it is a list of length ${1}$ &mdash; ${P(1) =
	P(0) + 1.}$ And if the list contains two elements, then it is a list of
	length ${2}$ &mdash; ${P(2) = P(1) + 1 = (P(0) + 1) + 1.}$
</p>
<p>
	The function above captures this induction. If the
	<var>next</var> field is ${0,}$ then we've reached the end of a list; the
	list of length ${0.}$ However, if the <var>next</var> field is not ${0,}$
	then the list is not empty. In which case we must continue until we reach
	the end of the list.
</p>
