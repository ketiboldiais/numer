<h2>Searching a Linked List</h2>
<p>
	As we saw with arrays, we can search through a linked list. The catch,
	however, is that we cannot employ binary search. This is because with
	the linked list, we do not have indices. There are only pointers. The
	only way for us to know when we've reached some element is by
	traversing. And because we have no choice but to traverse, we cannot
	access the
	<q>middle node</q> in constant time. As such, binary search on a linked
	list is no better than a linear search.
</p>
<p>That said, suppose we had the following linked list:</p>
<div id="search_ll_1"></div>
<p>
	Now suppose our query is <var>2</var>. From the linked list above,
	that's the fourth node. Searching for our query is similar to linear
	searching through an array &mdash; we just have to pass the value we
	want found, and a pointer to the linked list.
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
	Node* linearSearch(Node* p, int query) {
		while(p != 0) {
			if (p->data == query) {
				return p;
			}
			p = p->next;
		}
		return 0;
	}
</code></pre>
<p>
	With the implementation above, we're returning a pointer to the query
	if it's found. Otherwise, we return <var>0</var>, in which case the
	pointer to the query is null. This, of course, is entirely arbitrary.
	We could return <var>true</var>, <var>false</var>, <var>1</var>,
	<var>0</var>, or print some output to the console.
</p>
<p>Testing with the diagram above:</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
	#include &lt;iostream&gt;

	struct Node {
		int data;
		Node* next;
	};
	
	Node* newNode(int data) {
		Node* node = new Node;
					node->data = data;
					node->next = 0;
		return node;
	}
	
	Node* linearSearch(Node* p, int query) {
		while(p != 0) {
			if (p->data == query) {
				return p;
			}
			p = p->next;
		}
		return 0;
	}
	
	int main() {
		Node* root        = 0;
		Node* node1       = newNode(3);
					root        = node1;
		Node* node2       = newNode(9);
					node1->next = node2;
		Node* node3       = newNode(5);
					node2->next = node3;
		Node* node4       = newNode(2);
					node3->next = node4;
		Node* node5       = newNode(4);
					node4->next = node5;
		Node* list        = root;
		Node* query       = linearSearch(list, 2);
	
		std::cout &lt;&lt; query->data &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	
		return 0;
	}

<p>
	As we saw with arrays, however, we can improve linear search through
	<i>transposition</i> or <i>move-to-head</i>. Recall that with
	transposition, whenever we search for a particular element, the element
	moves closer to the beginning. And with move-to-head, the element
	containing the key moves immediately to the head after a successful
	search.
</p>
<p>
	It turns out that transposition isn't a very good idea, but before we
	address why, let's consider move-to-head, the preferred approach with
	linked lists. To start, let's consider the following linked list,
	supposing the key we're searching for is <var>7</var>:
</p>
<div id="search_ll_2"></div>
<p>
	This is the third node, and we want to make it the list's head. As we
	saw with our implementation of linear search earlier, we used a
	temporary pointer to traverse the linked list, so as to check for
	equality to our key. Thus, conducting linear search on our linked list,
	the temporary pointer, at some point, reaches the node storing
	<var>7</var>. As such, once we reach the node storing <var>7</var>, we
	want to bring the node to the head.
</p>
<p>
	To do so, we must modify the second node, since the third node will
	move. In this case, the second node &mdash; the node right before our
	key &mdash; should point the third node &mdash; the node right after
	our key. To do so, we must have a pointer on the node immediately
	before our key as well.
</p>
<div id="search_ll_3"></div>
<p>
	How do we get a pointer on the previous node? By using a second
	pointer. Thus, our linear search will use two pointers &mdash;
	<var>p</var>, the <b>traverser</b>, and <var>q</var>, the
	<b>tailer</b>, that follows immediately behind <var>p</var>. Then, the
	two pointers work together as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<var>p</var> begins traversing, starting at the first node. If the
		key is there, stop. Return the node's address. Otherwise, proceed to
		the next step. In this case, it is not.
	</li>
	<li>
		Since the first node is not the key, <var>p</var> moves to the second
		node <em>and</em> <var>q</var> points to the first node.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once again, we found no match, so <var>p</var> moves to the next node
		&mdash; the third node &mdash; and <var>q</var> moves to the next
		node, the second node. At this point we've found our key.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Notice the end result. We have a pointer to the node just before the
	node containing the key, and a pointer to the node containing the key.
	This is exactly where we want to be. The implementation:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
	Node* linearSearch(Node* root, int key) {
		Node* current = root;
		Node* previous = 0;
		while (current != 0) {
			if (current->data == key) {
				previous->next = current->next;
				current->next = root;
				root = current;
				return root;
			}
			previous = current;
			current = current->next;
		}
		return 0;
