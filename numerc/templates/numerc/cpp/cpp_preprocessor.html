<h1>Preprocessors & Libraries</h1>
<section id="preprocessor">
	<p>
		C++ uses a
		<span class="term">preprocessor</span> to process source code before the
		code goes to the compiler. The preprocessor performs several tasks. First,
		it goes through the entire source code, and replaces every comment with a
		single space. Then, it looks for
		<span class="term">preprocessor directives</span> and executes them. These
		directives always start with a hash sign, <span class="monoText">#</span>.
		Some examples:
	</p>
	<ul class="syntax">
		<li>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
		<li>#include "foo.h"</li>
		<li>#if</li>
		<li>#else</li>
		<li>#endif</li>
		<li>#ifdef</li>
	</ul>
	<ul class="syntax">
		<li>#ifndef</li>
		<li>#define</li>
		<li>#undef</li>
		<li>#line</li>
		<li>#error</li>
		<li>#pragma</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The most commonly used directive is <span class="monoText">#include</span>.
		When the preprocessor encounters this directive, it replaces the line with
		the file referred to (the preprocessor processes that file as well). Once
		the directive is processed, it is removed.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can think of <span class="monoText">#include</span> as akin to importing
		libraries or modules in other languages. When we write
		<span class="monoText">#include ${\alpha}$</span> into a source code file
		${\beta}$, C++ essentially dumps, or pastes, all of the contents of
		${\alpha}$ into file ${\beta.}$
	</p>

<section id="libraries">
	<h2>Libraries</h2>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">library</span> is just a special word for a source code
		file that groups, or gathers, related operations. We can think of it as a
		package containing snippets of code that make our main driver (the source
		code file containing the brunt of our program) easier to produce, test,
		maintain, and ship.
	</p>
	<p>
		A C++ library consists of two parts: (1) a
		<span class="term">header file</span>, and (2) an
		<span class="term">implementation file</span>. The header file &mdash;
		denoted by the extension <span class="monoText">.h</span> &mdash; provides
		all of the function prototypes (e.g., names and types) and usage comments.
		The implementation file, denoted by the extension
		<span class="monoText">.cpp</span> &mdash; implements everything in the
		header file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Libraries are a means of modularization &mdash; they break down and separate
		source code into smaller pieces. For example, consider the following
		program:
	</p>
	<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;
		using namespace std;

		double absolute_value(double n) {
			if (n < 0.0) {
				return -1.0 * n;
			} else if (n > 0.0) {
				return n;
			} else {
				return 0;
			}
		};
		
		double square(double n) {
			return n * n;
		};
		
		double sqrt(double n) {
			const double EPSILON = 0.001;
			double lower, upper, guess;
			if (n < 1) {
				lower = n;
				upper = 1;
			} else {
				lower = 1;
				upper = n;
			}
			while ((upper - lower) > EPSILON) {
				guess = (lower + upper) / 2;
				if (square(guess) > n) {
					upper = guess;
				} else {
					lower = guess;
				}
			}
			return (lower + upper) / 2;
		};

		int main() {
			double a = 4.0;
			double b = square(a);
			double c = sqrt(a);
			cout << "The number is: " << a << endl;
			cout << "It's square is: " << b << endl;
			cout << "It's square root is: " << c << endl;
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the program above, we have three functions,
		<span class="monoText">absolute_value()</span>,
		<span class="monoText">square()</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">square_root()</span>. The main driver, indicated by
		the function <span class="monoText">main()</span>, is fairly simple. It just
		computes and outputs the square and square root of
		<span class="monoText">4.0</span>. But just look at the size of this thing.
		It's huge, for a relatively simple computation. What we instead should do is
		&#8220;package&#8221; the functions
		<span class="monoText">absolute_value()</span>,
		<span class="monoText">square()</span>, and
		<span class="monoText">square_root()</span> into a library.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first step is to write all of the function prototypes inside a header
		file. Following best practice, that file should be the name of our library.
		Let's call it <span class="monoText">maths.h</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		// maths.h
		double absolute_value(double n);
		double square(double n);
		double sqrt(double n);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice <span class="monoText">maths.h</span> only contains the function
		protoypes. This is intentional. A header file represents the
		<span class="term">interface</span>. It should only inform the user what the
		function does; implementation details shouldn't be presented.
	</p>
	<p>
		Second step: Implement the functions. All the details surrounding the
		interface's implementation (i.e., how the functions in the header file are
		implemented) are placed in a separate source code file. Again following best
		practice, that source code file should have the same name as the header file
		it implements. Thus, we'll call it <span class="monoText">maths.cpp</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		// maths.cpp
		#include "maths.h"

		double absolute_value(double n) {
			if (n < 0.0) {
				return -1.0 * n;
			} else if (n > 0.0) {
				return n;
			} else {
				return 0;
			}
		};

		double square(double n) {
			return n * n;
		};

		double sqrt(double n) {
			const double EPSILON = 0.001;
			double lower, upper, guess;
			if (n < 1) {
				lower = n;
				upper = 1;
			} else {
				lower = 1;
				upper = n;
			}
			while ((upper - lower) > EPSILON) {
				guess = (lower + upper) / 2;
				if (square(guess) > n) {
					upper = guess;
				} else {
					lower = guess;
				}
			}
			return (lower + upper) / 2;
		};
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice the <span class="monoText">#include maths.h</span>. This is what
		effectively tells C++ that
		<span class="monoText">maths.cpp</span> implements
		<span class="monoText">math.h</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Third step: We include the header file,
		<span class="monoText">maths.h</span>, inside the main driver (a file named
		<span class="monoText">main.cpp</span>):
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		// main.cpp
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;
		#include "maths.h"
		using namespace std;
		
		int main() {
			double a = 4.0;
			double b = square(a);
			double c = sqrt(a);
			cout << "The number is: " << a << endl;
			cout << "It's square is: " << b << endl;
			cout << "It's square root is: " << c << endl;
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Notice the <span class="monoText">#include "maths.h"</span>. This
		effectively dumps all of the contents of
		<span class="monoText">maths.h</span> into the
		<span class="monoText">main.cpp</span>. Our main driver is now much, much
		shorter and cleaner.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, to run this code, we'll need to compile
		<span class="monoText">main.cpp</span> and
		<span class="monoText">maths.cpp</span>, then link their resulting
		executables into a single executable.
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		g++ -c maths.cpp
		g++ -c main.cpp
		g++ -o mainProgram main.o maths.o
		./mainProgram

		The number is: 4
		It's square is: 16
		It's square root is: 2.00012
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We can make the entire compilation and linking process above easier by
		writing a <span class="monoText">Makefile</span>. To do so, we simply create
		a new file called <span class="monoText">Makefile</span
		><label for="makefile" class="margin-toggle"><sup></sup></label>
		<input
			type="checkbox"
			id="makefile"
			class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
		/>
		<span class="marginnote"
			>For more information on Makefiles,
			<a href="{% url 'numerc:cpp_oop' %}#make_files"><i>see</i> Classes: Make Files</a
			>.</span
		>
		inside our directory, and write the following code inside:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		CC = g++
		CFLAGS = -Wall -g
		objects = main.o maths.o
		all: $(objects)
		clean:
			$(RM) *.o all
		main: $(objects)
			$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o mainProgram $(objects)
	</code></pre>
	<p>This leads to a much faster and easier compilation and linking process:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		make
		make main
		./mainProgram

		The number is: 4
		It's square is: 16
		It's square root is: 2.00012
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Whenever we write <span class="monoText">#include ${f}$</span>, where ${f}$
		is some library, in our source code file, the underlying process is
		essentially what's seen above. The contents of ${f}$ are dumped into the
		source code file, where they are used and treated as if we wrote them
		directly into the source code file.
	</p>

<section id="header_files">
	<h2>Header Files</h2>
	<p>
		Let's forget about the notion of libraries for a moment, and just talk about
		header files. The basic idea behind a header file is what forms the basis
		for libraries. As aforementioned, by convention, we indicate header files
		with a <span class="monoText">.h</span> extension. E.g.,
		<span class="monoText">foo.h</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To begin, we start by considering the following code, contained in a file
		called <span class="monoText">print.cpp</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;

		int main() {
			char message[] = "Hello world!";
			std::cout << message << std::endl;
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Hello world!
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		All we're doing is outputting to the console the contents of
		<span class="monoText">message</span>. Let's say we don't want to keep
		writing the line containing <span class="monoText">std::cout</span> and
		<span class="monoText">std::endl</span>, so we write a
		<span class="monoText">print()</span> function:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;

		void printString(const char* message) {
			std::cout << message << std::endl;
		}
		
		int main() {
			char message[] = "Hello world!";
			printString(message);
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		"Hello world!";
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Now let's say we have another file,
		<span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.cpp</span>, that prints custom error
		messages. Let's further say that we want to use our
		<span class="monoText">printString()</span> function; it's pretty useful
		after all:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;

		void end_of_file_reached() {
			printString("End of the file reached during read.");
		}
		
		void negative_integer() {
			printString("Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.");
		}
		
		void float_detected() {
			printString("Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.");
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The problem with our <span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.cpp</span> file:
		The compiler has no idea what
		<span class="monoText">printString()</span> is. In fact,
		<span class="monoText">printString()</span> just doesn't exist. We need a
		way to tell the compiler that
		<span class="monoText">printString()</span> actually exists. To do so, we
		must write a function declaration (i.e., a function without its body):
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;

		void printString(const char* message);
		
		void end_of_file_reached() {
			printString("End of the file reached during read.");
		}
		
		void negative_integer() {
			printString("Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.");
		}
		
		void float_detected() {
			printString("Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.");
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The code above compiles just fine. But notice what this means. Do we have to
		write these function declarations in all of our files? The answer is,
		frankly, yes. We have to include the relevant function declarations
		everywhere. As we can surmise, this is tedious. We just have one function
		above, but with larger programs, we could easily have hundreds, if not
		thousands, of functions. This is where header files come to the rescue.
	</p>
	<p>
		What we can do is create a new file called
		<span class="monoText">print.h</span>, and place therein our function
		declaration:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		// print.h
		#pragma once

		void printString(const char* message);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We'll talk about <span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> in a moment. For
		now, the key point is that we're placing our function
		<span class="monoText">printString()</span> declaration inside the header
		file. Then, inside <span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.cpp</span>, we
		include the header file:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;
		#include "print.h"
		
		
		void end_of_file_reached() {
			printString("End of the file reached during read.");
		}
		
		void negative_integer() {
			printString("Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.");
		}
		
		void float_detected() {
			printString("Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.");
		}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Our code compiles just fine. Now, inside
		<span class="monoText">print.cpp</span>, the
		<span class="monoText">main()</span> function was included for demonstration
		purposes. <span class="monoText">print.cpp</span> isn't our main driver.
		Instead, <span class="monoText">main()</span> should be placed in a
		<span class="monoText">Main.cpp</span> file. Accordingly, let's place
		<span class="monoText">main()</span> inside a new file
		<span class="monoText">main.cpp</span> with some code:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;
		#include "print.h"
		
		int main() {
			printString("Hello world!");
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		Hello world!
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This works as expected. Next, we can transfer our function declarations in
		<span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.cpp</span> into a header file of its
		own:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include "print.h"

		void end_of_file_reached();
		void negative_integer();
		void float_detected();
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Then, placing <span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.h</span> into our
		<span class="monoText">main.cpp</span> file:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;
		#include "print.h"
		#include "ErrorMessages.h"
		
		int main() {
			end_of_file_reached();
			negative_integer();
			float_detected();
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		End of the file reached during read.
		Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.
		Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		It works as expected. Let's go back to that
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> statement.
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> is a preprocessor, and it's
		essentially a safeguard. To see why we need
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span>, suppose
		<span class="monoText">print.h</span> contained a
		<span class="monoText">struct</span> called
		<span class="monoText">CustomMessages</span>, and we removed
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span>:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		void printString(const char* message);

		struct CommonMessages {};
	</code></pre>
	<p>If we tried to compile our program again:</p>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		make all

		./print.h:3:8: error: redefinition of 'CommonMessages'
		struct CommonMessages {};
					^
		main.cpp:2:10: note: './print.h' included multiple times, additional include site here
		#include "print.h"
						^
		./ErrorMessages.h:1:10: note: './print.h' included multiple times, additional include site here
		#include "print.h"
						^
		./print.h:3:8: note: unguarded header; consider using #ifdef guards or #pragma once
		struct CommonMessages {};
					^
		1 error generated.
		make: *** [main.o] Error 1
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		We get an error message that we're redefining
		<span class="monoText">CommonMessages</span>. Why is this happening? Well,
		recall what <span class="monoText">#include</span> does. It essentially
		tells the preprocessor to &#8220;copy-and-paste&#8221; contents of a file
		into the file. Thus, by omitting <span class="monoText">#pragma once</span>,
		we have <span class="monoText">struct CommonMessages {};</span> inside
		<span class="monoText">print.cpp</span>, then
		<span class="monoText">struct CommonMessages {};</span> in
		<span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.cpp</span>. When we include
		<span class="monoText">print.h</span> and
		<span class="monoText">ErrorMessages.h</span> inside
		<span class="monoText">main.cpp</span>, we have two
		<span class="monoText">struct CommonMessages {}</span> inside the same file.
		This violates C++'s rule prohibiting redefinitions.
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> ensures that this duplication
		doesn't happen. It essentially tells the preprocessor, &#8220;Only include
		this once.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		Including <span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> in
		<span class="monoText">print.h</span>, things go back to normal:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#pragma once
		void printString(const char* message);

		struct CommonMessages {};
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="language-bash"><code>
		End of the file reached during read.
		Negative integer detected. Only positive integers permitted.
		Floating point number detected. Only integers permitted.
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		As an aside, before <span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> came along,
		the traditional way to ensure duplication doesn't occur is with
		<span class="monoText">ifndef ... endif</span> block. To illustrate:
	</p>
	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#ifndef _PRINT_H
		#define _PRINT_H
		void printString(const char* message);

		struct CommonMessages {};
		#endif
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		For our purposes, the code above does the same thing as
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span>. It essentially says that if the
		symbol <span class="monoText">_PRINT_H</span> is not defined, go ahead and
		define. Otherwise, don't define it. This is essentially what
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> does. Modern C++ programs use
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> because it's cleaner and easier,
		but there are many C++ programs that continue to use the traditional method.
		For most programs, which to use comes down to personal preference. Most
		compilers today support <span class="monoText">#pragma once</span>, but
		there may be situations where a machine uses a compiler that doesn't support
		the idiom. Given how much more widespread
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span> has become, we will use
		<span class="monoText">#pragma once</span>.
