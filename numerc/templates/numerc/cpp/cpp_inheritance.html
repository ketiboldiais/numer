<section id="id">
	<p>
		As C++ supports object-oriented programming, inheritance is unusurprisingly
		supported in the language. There are, however, some significant differences
		between inheritance in C++ and inheritance in a language like Java. Before
		we address those differences, it's worth quickly reviewing what inheritance
		is.
