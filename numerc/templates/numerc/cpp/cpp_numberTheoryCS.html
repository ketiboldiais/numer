	<h2>Number Representation</h2>
	<p>Consider this image:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\huge 7}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Our immediate response is to recognize this as the number
		&#8220;seven.&#8221; In reality, however, the image above is just a
		symbol for the number seven. In some alternate universe, the majority
		of the world could have used one of the following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \huge \begin{matrix} \text{VII} & \text{ז} & \text{七} \\ \text{७}
			& \text{፯} & \text{৭} \\ \text{٧} & \text{౭} & \text{៧} \\ \text{๗} &
			\text{௭} & \text{൭} \end{matrix} $$
		</div>
		<figcaption>
			From top right to bottom left: Roman, Hebrew, Chinese, Devanagari,
			Amharic, Bengali, Arabic, Telugu, Khmer, Thai, Tamil, and Kannada
			numerals.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Or, the majority could have used tally marks, but here too we find
		variety:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/tallies.svg' %}"
			alt="tally system"
			loading="lazy"
			class="eighty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>
			From top to bottom: The tally system often used in the Western world,
			the tally system used France, Brazil, and former French colonies, and
			the dot-dash tally, commonly used in forestry.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This all to say that the number seven is a conception in the mind
		&mdash; a quantification of something we perceive in the real world.
		What that quantification is could be many things: Seven positions from
		a starting point, seven units from zero, seven apples, the fourth
		prime, a lucky number, etc. Regardless, we use the symbol ${7}$ to
		communicate this idea, and provide other symbols for refinement &mdash;
		${7~\text{cm},}$ ${7}$ gallons, ${7}$ points, ${i = 7,}$ ${+7,}$
		${-7,}$ ${\lvert 7 \rvert,}$ ${7x,}$ and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Question: How many symbols do we need to represent
		<span class="underlineText">any</span> number? There are infinitely
		many numbers, but we cannot have infinitely many symbols. Thus, we need
		a finite number of symbols that allows us to represent every
		conceivable number. For most of the world, that finite number is ten:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\huge 0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9}$</p>
		</div>
		<figcaption>The Hindu-Arabic numerals</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Number systems that use ten symbols to represent all numbers are called
		<span class="term">decimal number systems</span>, or
		<span class="term">base-10 systems</span>. In the Western decimal
		number system, ten symbols (called the
		<span class="term">Hindu-Arabic numerals</span>) are used to represent
		every conceivable number. The number of unique symbols used in a
		numbering system to represent a number in that system is called the
		<span class="term">base</span> or <span class="term">radix</span> of
		the numbering system. For example, with the decimal system, the radix
		is ${10.}$ For the ancient Mayans, the radix was ${20}$ (called a
		<span class="italicsText">vigesimal system</span>). For the
		Babylonians, the radix was ${60}$ (called a
		<span class="italicsText">base-60 system</span>).
	</p>
	<p>
		To understand how the base works, we'll consider the decimal system.
		First, we have enough symbols to represent the numbers zero through
		nine:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\huge 0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The symbols above, however, hide a critical fact: They all have an
		infinite amount of &#8220;slots&#8221; or &#8220;places&#8221;,
		immediately to the left, occupied by a zero:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				$$ \large \begin{aligned} & \ldots 01 \\ & \ldots 02 \\ & \ldots 03
				\\ & \ldots 04 \\ & \ldots 05 \\ & \ldots 06 \\ & \ldots 07 \\ &
				\ldots 08 \\ & \ldots 09 \\ \end{aligned} $$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we reach the number nine, we've run out of unique symbols. So to
		represent the number ten, we go to the slot on the left (occupied by a
		zero), and increment it by ${1:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				$$ \begin{aligned} & \ldots 01 \\ & \ldots 02 \\ & \ldots 03 \\ &
				\ldots 04 \\ & \ldots 05 \\ & \ldots 06 \\ & \ldots 07 \\ & \ldots
				08 \\ & \ldots 09 \\ & \ldots 10 \\ & \ldots 11 \\ & \vdots \\ &
				\ldots 19 \end{aligned} $$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Once we get to nineteen, we increment the slot again:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				$$ \begin{aligned} & \ldots 10 \\ & \ldots 11 \\ & \ldots 12 \\ &
				\ldots 13 \\ & \ldots 14 \\ & \ldots 15 \\ & \ldots 16 \\ & \ldots
				17 \\ & \ldots 18 \\ & \ldots 19 \\ & \ldots 20 \end{aligned} $$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because there are ten symbols, and for each of these ten we can assign
		one of the ten symbols immediately to its left, we have ${10 \times 10
		= 10^2 = 100}$ unique symbols. This allows us to represent numbers from
		zero (${0}$) to ninety-nine (${99}$).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once we reach ${99,}$ we've run out of symbols for the second slot, so
		we turn to the third slot: ${100.}$ Now we have ${10 \times 10 \times
		10 = 10^3 = 1000}$ unique symbols. This allows us to count from zero to
		nine hundred and ninety-nine (${999}$). Once we've reached ${999,}$ the
		process continues. We go to the fourth slot, giving us ${10^4}$ unique
		symbols. Once that's run out we go to the fifth&mdash;${10^5}$ unique
		symbols; then the sixth&mdash;${10^6}$ unique symbols;
		seventh&mdash;${10^7;}$ eighth&mdash;${10^8;}$
		<span class="italicsText">ad infinitum</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, we have a way to generate unique symbols. But using this approach,
		we have a problem: How do we ensure that someone seeing ${67}$ doesn't
		interpret it as ${6}$ and ${7?}$ This is accomplished by everyone
		agreeing to intrepret the second position as indicating how many times
		we've used up symbols for the first position. For example, in the case
		of ${67,}$ we interpet the ${6}$ as: "We've run through the symbols
		${0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9}$ six times in the first position." With the
		${7}$ included, the number ${67}$ translates to &#8220;Six of the ten
		symbols and seven of the symbols&#8221;:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(6 \times 10) + 7}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we see ${826,}$ we think: &#8220;Eight of ten of the ten symbols,
		two of ten of the symbols, and six of the symbols:&#8221;
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(8 \times 10 \times 10) + (2 \times 10) + 6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This process continues over and over, embodying the following pattern:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${(s_i \times 10^k) \ldots (s_3 \times 10^3) + (s_2 \times 10^2) +
				(s_1 \times 10^1) + s_0}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${k}$ and ${s_i}$ are positive integers. Each of the terms above
		is called a place, and they are multiples of ten. For example, ${s_2
		\times 10^2}$ is the tenth's place, ${s_3 \times 10^3}$ is the
		hundredth's place, and so on. The term ${s_0}$ is often called the
		one's place, and it is mathematically denoted ${s_0 \times 10^0:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${(s_i \times 10^k) \ldots (s_3 \times 10^3) + (s_2 \times 10^2) +
				(s_1 \times 10^1) + (s_0 \times 10^0)}$

		<h3>Octal Number System</h3>
		<p>
			Although the decimal system allows us to write large numbers with
			fewer symbols, the more symbols we use, the more computations we must
			perform and the more likely we are to commit computational errors.
			Inversely, the fewer symbols we need, the less computations we must
			perform, and the less likely we are to commit computational errors.
			The tradeoff, however, is readability. With fewer digits, larger
			numbers are long and difficult to decipher. Nevertheless, some
			problems (as we'll later see) do not require humans to directly read
			the numbers, so we've gone ahead and used number systems with fewer
			symbols. One such system is the
			<span class="term">octal number system</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To understand the octal number system, it's worth mentioning a bit of
			its history. Before the French Revolution, most of Europe used a
			dizzying array of inconsistent measurement systems. At the turn of
			the nineteenth century, global trade increased dramatically, and the
			ancient units proved costly for international transactions. The
			French merchant would appear in court arguing he received less than
			the agreed upon amount, ${1}$
			<span class="italicsText">pied du roi</span> (the length of the
			King's foot, about ${32.48}$ cm), with the German merchant responding
			that he gave the correct amount, ${1}$ Fuß (possibly ${23.6}$ cm;
			there were competing values of Fuß).
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1799, the Académie des sciences, a French learned society known
			for solving scientific and mathematical problems, tasked a panel of
			scientists and mathematicians to remedy these problems.<sup></sup>
			Their solution: a decimal system of measurement relying on ten
			symbols, using prefixes like deci, centi, milli, deca, hecto, kilo,
			and several others. As we can guess, we know this system today as the
			<span class="italicsText">metric system</span>.
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				Among the panelists were the mathematicians Joseph-Louis Lagrange,
				Pierre-Simon Laplace, and Nicolas de Condorcet.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Across the Channel, the English had their own system and its
			proponents. One such defender was the Scottish economist James
			Anderson. Weary of the costs of changing a centuries-old measurement
			system, Anderson advocated for an alternative more closely aligned
			with the English system. Instead of relying on ten symbols,
			Anderson's system relied on eight:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\huge 0 ~ 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~ 4 ~ 5 ~ 6 ~ 7}$</p>
			</div>
			<figcaption>The octal numbers.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Likely inspired by the Latin <span class="italicsText">octo</span>,
			meaning &#8220;eight,&#8221; Anderson called his alternative the
			<span class="italicsText">octal system</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Knowing the basics of number systems, we see that in the octal number
			system, the radix is eight &mdash; a base-8 number system. And with
			eight symbols, we can represent the numbers zero through seven. Like
			what we saw with the decimal system, we run out of symbols once we
			reach ${7.}$ To represent the number eight, we add a new symbol to
			the left, and start the symbol to the right back at ${0:}$
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\huge 10}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Thus, in the octal number system, the number eight is represented as
			${10.}$ Nine is ${11,}$ ten is ${12,}$ eleven is ${13,}$ and so on.
			Once we reach ${17,}$ the number fifteen, we increment the number to
			the right and start at zero on the left: The number sixteen is
			${20.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			Similar to what we saw with the decimal system, going from right to
			left, the first position indicates the one's, and the second position
			indicates how many times we've gone through the first position. The
			third position indicates how many times we've gone through the
			second, the fourth the third, the third the fourth, and so on. The
			difference, however, is that instead of using a base of ten, we use a
			base of eight:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>
					${(s_i \times 8^k) \ldots (s_3 \times 8^3) + (s_2 \times 8^2) +
					(s_1 \times 8^1) + (s_0 \times 8^0)}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Thus, the octal number ${117}$ is actually:</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${(1 \times 8^2) + (1 \times 8^1) + (7 \times 8^0) = 79}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because octal numbers use the same symbols as the decimal numbers, we
			indicate them with subscripted brackets containing the base. For
			example, the octal number ${117}$ is formally written as:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\Large 117_{[8]}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Alternatively (and in some computer languages), the number ${117}$
			would be indicated as:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\Large \texttt{0o117} }$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Following standard practice, we will use the former syntax in
			exposition, but the latter when referring to code.
		</p>
		<p>
			To convert quickly from decimal to octal, it's helpful to know the
			first ten powers of eight by heart:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				$$ \begin{aligned} &8^1 = 8 \\ &8^2 = 64 \\ &8^3 = 512 \\ &8^4 =
				4096 \\ &8^5 = 32~768 \\ &8^6 = 262~144 \\ &8^7 = 2~097~152 \\ &8^8
				= 16~777~216 \\ &8^9 = 134~217~728 \\ &8^{10} = 1~073~741~824
				\end{aligned} $$

	<h2>Primality Tests</h2>

		Suppose we're given a number ${n.}$ We want to answer the following

	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>Is ${n}$ a prime number?</p>
		</div>

		Recall the definition for a prime number. ${n}$ is a prime number only

	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>${n}$ is a natural number,</li>
			<li>${n}$ is greater than ${1,}$ and</li>

		Algorithms that determine whether a given number ${n}$ is a prime

		and credit card numbers stay secure as they are transmitted across
		networks.
	</p>
	<section id="brute_force_primality">
		<h3>Brute-force Primality Test</h3>
		<p>
			There are a variety of ways to implement a primality test, but we
			start with the simplest algorithm: a
			<span class="term">brute-force primality test</span>. This algorithm
			is part of a family of algorithms called
			<span class="term">brute-force algorithms</span>. These algorithms
			solve problems in the most simple, direct, or obvious way. For the
			prime number testing, the brute-force primality test is closely
			related to <span class="term">proof-by-exhaustion</span>, a method of
			proof in mathematics. We exhaust all of the possibilities before we
			exhaust ourselves (or more accurately, our machine's RAM).
		</p>
		<p>
			To implement the brute-force primality test, we study the
			mathematical definition:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Definition</small>
			<p>
				If a natural number ${n}$ is prime, then ${n}$ is greater than
				${1}$ and is not divisible by any positive integer other than ${1}$
				and ${n.}$
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			When implementing algorithms based on mathematical definitions, it's
			helpful to read the definitions in all directions. In this case,
			let's read the definition in terms of its contrapositive:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Definition</small>
			<p>
				If ${n}$ is less than or equal to ${1}$ or is divisible by a
				positive integer other than ${1}$ and ${n,}$ then ${n}$ is
				<span class="underlineText">not</span> prime.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			The contrapositive essentially lays out the brute-force algorithm.
			The implementation is simple: Using a for-loop, we go through all of
			the integers from ${1}$ to ${n - 1,}$ verifying no number divides
			${n}$ without a remainder. If there is such a number, that would
			imply that ${n}$ has a divisor other than ${1}$ and itself. This
			violates the last requirement above, and ${n}$ is not a prime number.
			Otherwise, ${n}$ is a prime number. Implementing in pseudocode:
		</p>

		<ol class="alg">
			<li>fn brute_force_primality_test(int n):</li>
			<ol>
				<li>if (n < 2): return "n is not prime";</li>
				<li>else:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>for (int i = 2; i < n - 1; i++):</li>
					<ol>
						<li>if (n % i == 0): return "n is not prime";</li>
					</ol>
					<li>return "n is prime";</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>
			With brute-force primality test, we must iterate through ${n - 1}$
			elements. As such, the running time function for this algorithm can
			be expressed as ${f(n) = n - 1.}$ Applying asymptotic analysis, the
			brute-force primality test, in the worst-case scenario, has a running
			time of order ${O(n).}$ This is linear time. Can we do better? Let's
			consider another algorithm.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="trial_division">
		<h3>Trial Division</h3>
		<p>
			The second primality test we investigate is
			<span class="term">trial division</span>. This algorithm relies on
			the same definition above, but the key insight lies in honing in on
			what constitutes a composite number &mdash; a number that is not
			prime.
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Definition</small>
			<p>If ${n}$ is composite, then the following proposition is true:</p>
			<figure>$$ \large n = a \cdot b $$</figure>
			<p>where ${a, b \in \N,}$ ${a \geq 2,}$ and ${b \leq n - 1}$</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			With the brute-force primality test, we attempted to find the divisor
			${a.}$ The index ${i}$ represents the divisor ${a,}$ and we iterated
			up to ${n-1}$ checking to see if ${\dfrac{n}{a} = b.}$ Now, given any
			two numbers ${p}$ and ${q,}$ or in our case, ${a}$ and ${b,}$ one
			will be less than or equal to the other. This proposition originates
			in the
			<a
				href="{% url 'numerm:balg_realProperties'%}#inequalities"
				target="_blank"
				>Trichotomy and closure laws</a
			>
			in real analysis. Suppose ${a \leq b.}$ This is a perfectly
			reasonable assumption to start with; we don't lose any generality in
			doing so.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, what's next? This is where we get creative. We look at the facts
			we have so far and try to draw further facts. We assumed that ${a
			\leq b.}$ And before that, we saw that the composite number ${n}$ has
			the form ${a \cdot b.}$ Our inequality looks like ${a \leq b,}$ so
			what if we tried getting it to look like ${n = a \cdot b?}$ To do so,
			we multiply ${a}$ to both sides:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				$$ \begin{aligned} a \cdot a &\leq a \cdot b \\ a^2 &\leq a \cdot b
				\end{aligned} $$
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			That's an interesting result. If ${n = a \cdot b}$ and ${a \leq b,}$
			we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 \leq n}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Now if we took the square root of both sides:</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \sqrt{a^2} &\leq \sqrt{n} \\ a &\leq \sqrt{n}
				\end{aligned} $$
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			This is another big insight. If ${n = a \cdot b}$ and ${a \leq b,}$
			then ${a \leq \sqrt{n}.}$ Given that ${a}$ must be less than
			${\sqrt{n,}}$ we don't have to search up to ${n - 1.}$ Instead, we
			only have to search up to ${\sqrt{n}.}$ The implementation is thus:
		</p>

		<ol class="alg">
			<li>${f}$ trial_division_primality(int n):</li>
			<ol>
				<li>if (n < 2): return "n is not prime";</li>
				<li>else:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>for (int i = 2; i < (sqrt(n)); i++):</li>
					<ol>
						<li>if n % i == 0:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>return "n is not prime";</li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<li>return "n is prime";</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		<p>
			With trial-division, the algorithm only takes ${\sqrt{n} - 1}$
			operations to execute. Hence, this algorithm has a time complexity of
			${O(\sqrt{n}),}$ or ${O(n^{1/2}).}$ This is fractional power time,
			which is faster than linear time. Note that the time complexity for
			this algorithm may vary depending on how
			<span class="monoText">sqrt(n)</span> is implemented. To avoid these
			issues, we can instead establish the test condition as
			<span class="monoText">i*i < n</span> rather than
			<span class="monoText">i < sqrt(n)</span>:
		</p>

		<ol class="alg">
			<li>${f}$ trial_division_primality(int n):</li>
			<ol>
				<li>if (n < 2): return "n is not prime";</li>
				<li>else:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>for (int i = 2; i*i < n; i++):</li>
					<ol>
						<li>if n % i == 0:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>return "n is not prime";</li>

					<li>return "n is prime";</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>

<section id="prime_factorization">
	<h2>Prime Factorization</h2>
	<p>
		Closely related to primality tests is
		<b>prime factorization</b> &mdash; expressing a number as a product of
		their prime factors. For example, the number ${12}$ in terms of its
		prime factors is:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can visualize prime factorization in terms of a tree. For example,
		the prime factors of ${100.}$ We start with ${2,}$ the first prime
		number. Since ${100}$ is divisible by ${2,}$ we get ${50:}$
	</p>
	<div id="primeFactor1"></div>
	<p>
		Then we consider the prime factors of ${50.}$ We start again with
		${2,}$ and we see that ${50}$ is also divisible by ${50:}$
	</p>

	<div id="primeFactor2"></div>

	<p>
		Then we look at ${25.}$ We go back to testing ${2.}$ ${25}$ is not
		divisible by ${2,}$ so we consider the next prime number, ${3.}$ ${25}$
		is not divisible by ${3,}$ so test the next prime number, ${5.}$ Here,
		${25}$ is divisible by ${5:}$
	</p>

	<div id="primeFactor3"></div>

	<p>Finally, we have ${5,}$ which leads to:</p>

	<div id="primeFactor4"></div>

	<p>
		Once we've reached the factor ${1,}$ we know we've found the prime
		factors.

		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Implementing the procedure above in pseudocode:</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>int factors[100];</li>
		<li>int exponents[100];</li>
		<li>int length = 0;</li>
		<li>fn primeFactors(int m) -> void:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while (m > 1):</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while (m % d == 0):</li>
				<ol>
					<li>m = m / d;</li>
					<li>k++;</li>
				</ol>
				<li>if (k > 0):</li>
				<ol>
					<li>length++;</li>
					<li>factors[length] = d;</li>
					<li>exponents[length] = k;</li>
				</ol>
				<li>d++;</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		In the pseudocode above, the <var>factors[]</var> array will hold the
		prime factors we find, and the <var>exponents[]</var> array will hold
		the exponents we find. Let's run through the code above with a simple
		example. Suppose we want to find the prime factors of ${24.}$ First, we
		call <var>primeFactors(24)</var>:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We then reach while-loop-1. Here, the test condition is
		<var>(m > 1)</var>. In this case, <var>24 > 1</var>, so we proceed:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We then encounter our while-loop-2. The test condition here is
		<var>(m % d == 0)</var>. In this case, <var>(24 % 2 == 0)</var> is
		true, so we proceed:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while <span class="greenText">(m % d == 0)</span>:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>m = m / d; <span class="blueText">m = 24 / 2 = 12</span></li>
					<li>k++; <span class="blueText">k = 1</span></li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Given that <var>m = 12</var>, while-loop-2's condition is still true,
		so we execute again:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while <span class="greenText">(m % d == 0)</span>:</li>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="blueText">m = 12</span></li>
					<li><span class="blueText">k = 1</span></li>
					<li>m = m / d; <span class="blueText">m = 12 / 2 = 6</span></li>
					<li>k++; <span class="blueText">k = 2</span></li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>Once more our test condition is true, so we execute again</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while <span class="greenText">(m % d == 0)</span>:</li>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="blueText">m = 6</span></li>
					<li><span class="blueText">k = 2</span></li>
					<li>m = m / d; <span class="blueText">m = 6 / 2 = 3</span></li>
					<li>k++; <span class="blueText">k = 3</span></li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Going back to while-loop-2, the test condition returns false &mdash;
		<var>(3 % 2 != 0)</var>. So, we go to the next line in while-loop-1. In
		this case, it's an if-statement, whose test condition is true:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while <span class="greenText">(m % d == 0)</span>:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>m = m / d;</li>
					<li>k++;</li>
				</ol>
				<li><span class="blueText">k = 3</span></li>
				<li>if <span class="greenText">(k > 0):</span></li>
				<ol>
					<li>
						factors[length] = d;
						<span class="blueText">factors[0] = 2</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						exponents[length] = k;
						<span class="blueText">exponents[0] = 3</span>
					</li>
					<li>length++ <span class="blueText">factors = 1</span></li>
				</ol>
				<li>d++; <span class="blueText">d = 3</span></li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Now <var>m = 3</var>, and we go back to while-loop-1's test condition.
		Here, we see that <var>m > 1 ${\equiv}$ 3 > 1</var>, which is true. So,
		we again execute while-loop-1's body. We set <var>int k = 0</var>, and
		reach while-loop-2. Here, we see that <var>m % d == 0</var> is true
		&mdash; <var>3 % 3 == 0</var>. So, we proceed executing while-loop-2's
		body:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while <span class="greenText">(m % d == 0)</span>:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>m = m / d; <span class="blueText">m = 3 / 3 = 1</span></li>
					<li>k++; <span class="blueText">k = 1</span></li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Now, with <var>m = 1</var>, while-loop-2's condition is false, so we
		exit while-loop-2 and continue with the rest of the statements in
		while-loop-1. We see that <var>k > 0 ${\equiv}$ 1 > 0</var>, so we
		execute the if-block:
	</p>
	<ol class="alg">
		<li>primeFactors(24):</li>
		<ol>
			<li>int m = 24;</li>
			<li>int d = 2;</li>
			<li>while <span class="greenText">(m > 1)</span>:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>int k = 0;</li>
				<li>while <span class="greenText">(m % d == 0)</span>:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>m = m / d;</li>
					<li>k++;</li>
				</ol>
				<li><span class="blueText">k = 1</span></li>
				<li>if <span class="greenText">(k > 0):</span></li>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="blueText">length = 1</span></li>
					<li>
						factors[length] = d;
						<span class="blueText">factors[1] = 3</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						exponents[length] = k;
						<span class="blueText">exponents[1] = 1</span>
					</li>
					<li>length++ <span class="blueText">length = 2</span></li>
				</ol>
				<li>d++; <span class="blueText">d = 4</span></li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	</ol>

	<p>
		With <var>m = 1</var>, our while-loop-1's condition is false, and we
		have finished. With the data from these two arrays, we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${24 = 2^3 \times 3^1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Which is, in fact, the prime factorization of ${24.}$ Intuitive as this
		algorithm is, it performs poorly in terms of time complexity. The worst
		case scenario in this case is when <var>m</var> is a prime number. If
		we call <var>primeFactors(23)</var>, for example, we would have to
		increment ${d}$ all the way up to ${23.}$ This leaves us with a time
		complexity of ${O(n).}$

	<h2>Bitwise Operations</h2>
	<p>
		For most developers, the bitwise operations are the least used. They
		can, however, come in very handy with certain problems. To begin, let's
		review these operations:
	</p>
	<table class="api">
		<thead>
			<th>Operation</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>${\color{cyan} \Large \texttt{a \& b}}$</td>
				<td>
					Bitwise-AND. Given two binary digits, returns 0 if any of the two
					digits are 0, otherwise 1.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>${\color{cyan} \Large \texttt{a | b}}$</td>
				<td>
					Bitwise-OR. Given two binary digits, returns 1 if any of the two
					gits are 1, otherwise 0.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					${\color{cyan} \Large \texttt{a~} {\huge\texttt{\^{}}}
					\texttt{~b}}$
				</td>
				<td>
					Bitwise-XOR. Given two binary digits, returns 1 if
					<em>exactly one</em> of the two digits is 1, otherwise 0.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>${\color{cyan} \Large \texttt{\~{}~b}}$</td>
				<td>
					Bitwise-NOT. Given a single binary digit, returns 0 if the digit
					is 1, and 1 if the digit is 0.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>${\color{cyan} \Large \texttt{a &lt;&lt; b}}$</td>
				<td>
					Bitwise-left-shift. Moves all of the bits to the left, with the
					position previously occupied by the least-significant bit filled
					with a 0.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>${\color{cyan} \Large \texttt{a &gt;&gt; b}}$</td>
				<td>
					Bitwise-right-shift. Moves all of the bits to the right, with the
					position previously occupied by the most-significant bit filled
					with a 0.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Let's see some examples. For the bitwise-AND:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &0000101 \\ \texttt{\&{}}~~~ &0000111 \\ \hline
		&0000101 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that we get <var>1</var> if, and only if, we have
		<var>1 & 1</var>. Otherwise, it's <var>0</var>. Furthermore, if we
		converted the binary numbers above into decimal, we get:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{5 \&{} 7 = 5} $$</figure>
	<p>Now let's see the bitwise-OR:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &0000101 \\ \texttt{|{}}~~~ &0000111 \\ \hline
		&0000111 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		In contrast to the bitwise-AND, for the bitwise-OR we get
		<var>0</var> if, and only if, we have <var>0 | 0</var>. Otherwise, get
		<var>1</var>. Thus, we have:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{5 | 7 = 7} $$</figure>
	<p>
		Closely related is the bitwise-XOR. This is essentially bitwise-OR, but
		with one restriction: We can't have two <var>1</var>s. In other words,
		we get <var>1</var> if, and only if, we have exactly one <var>1</var>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &0000101 \\ \texttt{\^{}}~~~ &0000111 \\ \hline
		&0000010 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we have:</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{5 \^{} 7 = 2} $$</figure>
	<p>
		Next, the bitwise-NOT. Unlike the previous operators, bitwise-NOT is a
		<i>unary operator</i> &mdash; it applies to only one operand. Thus:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \texttt{\~{}}~~~ &0000111 \\ \hline &1111000
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>This yields:</p>
	<figure>$$ \texttt{\~{} 7 = 120} $$</figure>
