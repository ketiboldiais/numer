	<h4>Brief Overview of Errors</h4>
	<p>
		Errors are unexpected or unintended program results. They fall into four
		categories: (1) <span class="term">compiler errors</span>; (2)
		<span class="term">linker errors</span>; (3)
		<span class="term">runtime errors</span>; and (4)
		<span class="term">logic errors</span>. We cover them briefly below.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Compiler Errors</span>. Like a human language, any given
		programming language has specific rules for how we write and use the
		language. These rules fall into two sets: (a)
		<span class="term">syntax</span> and (b)
		<span class="term">semantics</span>. A language's syntax is the set of all
		rules defining how meaning should be conveyed (in other words, how we can
		<span class="italicsText">write</span> in the language). A language's
		semantics is the set of all rules defining when there is
		<span class="italicsText">meaning</span>. For example:
	</p>

	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		/* 
		* Below are syntax errors. 
		* We neglected to terminate the string (forgetting a quotation * mark). 
		* And neglected to include a semicolon.
		*/

		std::cout << "errors << std::endl

		/*
		 * Below are semantic errors.
		 * We told the compiler that main() returns an int.
		 * But then we're returning a string (a char*).
		 * We also omitted the opening brace.
		 * This will confuse the compiler; where does the code start and end?
		*/

		int main() 
			return "Hello, world!"
		}

	</code></pre>

	<p>
		When we violate these rules &mdash; syntax and semantics &mdash; we receive
		a <span class="term">compiler error</span>. Syntax errors are relatively
		easy to fix. The compiler will usually pinpoint the particular line where
		the error occurred. Semantics errors are a little more difficult, but they
		should be easy to spot as long as we have a good understanding of semantic
		rules.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alternatively, the compiler may return a
		<span class="term">compiler warning</span> rather than a compiler error. The
		difference is that the source will still compile, but there is an inordinate
		amount of risk in doing so. A rule of thumb: Treat compiler warnings as if
		they are errors.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Linker Errors.</span> The process of
		<span class="term">linking</span> is when the
		<span class="italicsText">linker</span> attempts to piece together all of
		the difference parts of the program in preparation for execution. If the
		linker has trouble linking the program's object files together, we will
		receive a <span class="term">linker error</span>. The most common culprit
		behind linker errors: A missing library or object file. Usually, this
		happens when we use an incorrect file path or incorrect name.
	</p>

	<pre class="language-cpp"><code>
		#include &lt;iostream&gt;

		extern int phi;

		int main() {
			std::cout&lt;&lt;x;
			return 0;
		}
	</code></pre>

	<p>
		The code above will compile just fine, but it will return a linker error.
		Why? Because we are using some <span class="monoText">int</span> named
		<span class="monoText">phi</span>, that supposedly exists outside the source
		code. The problem? There is no file in the directory that contains, let
		alone defines, what <span class="monoText">int phi</span> is. Because the
		linker cannot find the necessary pieces, it returns a linker error. Linker
		errors most commonly occur when we use many libraries and external source
		code files, and they are trickier to fix. We will address them as they
		arise.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Runtime Errors.</span> Runtime errors are errors that
		occur when the program executes. Alongside logic errors, runtime errors are
		some of the most difficult to resolve. This is because they've managed to
		evade the compiler and the linker, and as such, there's something much more
		sinister occurring. The most common culprits: dividing by zero (<span
			class="monoText"
			>C++</span
		>
		is not among the languages that ascribes a value for dividing by zero),
		memory leaks (running out of memory, leading to either a crash or very slow
		execution), segmentation faults (touching memory we shouldn't be touching),
		stack or heap overflows (e.g., recursive functions that never or take too
		long to reach a base case), hangings (infinite loops), and file-not-found
		errors. Because runtime errors come in many forms, we will address them as
		they occur. As a preface, they are best handled with exceptions.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Logic Errors.</span> Logic errors are without a doubt
		the most difficult errors to fix. This is where there is not something wrong
		with our code: The code builds and executes with no problems, but we're
		seeing unexpected results. The problem is not in the code, but in our
		thinking. Like runtime errors, logic errors are best addressed as they
		occur, because they come in many forms &mdash; fence-post problems,
		exponential recursions, untraveled branches, and many more. For these kinds
		of errors, debuggers and test suites are extremely helpful.
