<h1>Patterns & Approaches</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		In this section, we examine some common patterns and problem solving
		approaches. In later sections, we will see these patterns and
		approaches over and over again &mdash; having a good handle on them
		early on is invaluable.

	<h2>Frequency Counter</h2>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure class="p">
		<p>
			Let ${C}$ and ${D}$ be sequences of numbers. Write a function that
			returns
			<var>true</var> if every value in ${C}$ has its corresponding square
			in ${D.}$ The frequency of values must be the same.
		</p>
		<p>For example, if the sequence ${C}$ is:</p>
		<figure>$$ \lang 1, 2, 3 \rang $$</figure>
		<p>
			the function must return <var>true</var> only if the sequence ${D}$
			is any of the following:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \lang 1, 4, 9 \rang \\ \lang 1, 9, 4 \rang \\ \lang 4, 1, 9 \rang
			\\ \lang 4, 9, 1 \rang \\ \lang 9, 1, 4 \rang \\ \lang 9, 4, 1 \rang
			\\ $$
		</figure>
	</figure>
	<p>
		There are many ways to go about this problem. First, the most obvious
		and straightforward approach is to use <b>brute-force</b>.
