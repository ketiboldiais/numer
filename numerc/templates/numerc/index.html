<h1>Preface</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		The pages below contain notes from various computer science courses I've
		taken, as well as my own independent readings. This page is updated daily,
		but every now and then I will miss something. I try to correct these errors
		during a full-weekend review at month's end. In the meantime, please excuse
		errors or omissions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Separately, I have another page,
		<a href="{% url 'numerm:index' %}">numerm</a>, containing similar notes for
		mathematics. I hope at least one of these pages helps anyone else exploring
		computer science.
