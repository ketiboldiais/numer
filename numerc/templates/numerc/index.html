<h1>Preface</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		<span class="drop">T</span>he pages below contain notes from various
		computer science courses I've taken, as well as my own independent readings.
		This page is updated daily, but every now and then I will miss something. I
		try to correct these errors during a full-weekend review at month's end. In
		the meantime, please excuse errors or omissions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Separately, I have another page,
		<a href="{% url 'numerm:index' %}"
			><span class="title">Review of Mathematics</span></a
		>, containing similar notes for mathematics. I hope at least one of these
		pages helps anyone else exploring computer science.
	</p>
	<p>
		The notes are organized by volume (indicated by a Roman numeral), then by
		chapter (indicated by a Hindu-Arabic numeral). The organization attempts to
		mirror a typical course sequence for a computer science concentration at a
		U.S. university. The volumes focus on a specific area of computer science,
		and the chapters focus on topics within that area. For particularly long
		topics, an outline is provided at the beginning of the page.

			<thead>
				<th>Volume</th>
				<th>Theme</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Foundations I: Java</td>
					<td>An introduction to programming.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Foundations II: Python</td>
					<td>Reinforcing the concepts introduced in the previous volume.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Foundations III: Lisp</td>
					<td>
						Refining the concepts introduced in the previous volume; particular
						focus placed on recursion.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Computer Architecture</td>
					<td>
						Investigating hardware; focus on C and Assembly; brief forray into
						embedded systems.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Data Structures & Algorithms: C++</td>
					<td>
						Tour of the C++ language; rigorous treatment of data structures and
						algorithms.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Programming Language Theory</td>
					<td>
						Survey of programming language theory and design; comparative
						analysis of various languages and paradigms.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Mobile Development: Swift</td>
					<td>
						Exploration of Swift and mobile development; Swift is one of the
						newest languages. Drawing from numerous programming language design
						choices, Swift is an ideal language for multilingual programmers.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>OOP Revisited: JavaScript</td>
					<td>
						Tour of JavaScript. JavaScript takes somewhat unusual design choices
						in programming language design, and is surprisingly complex.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Functional Programming: Haskell</td>
					<td>Reinforcement of the functional programming design paradigm.</td>
				</tr>
