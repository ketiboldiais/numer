	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>
		The following pages contain notes synthesized from my computer science
		studies. The notes are constantly being revised and updated, so please
		excuse errors or omissions. I try allocating as much time as I can learning
		something new each day and reporting my findings here. I then do some
		reviewing at the end of each week where I address any errors and omissions
		from the week's findings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Separately, I have another page,
		<a href="{% url 'numerm:index' %}">numerm</a
		>, containing similar notes for mathematics. I hope at least one of these
		pages helps anyone else trying to understand and navigate the fascinating
		world of computer science and mathematics.
