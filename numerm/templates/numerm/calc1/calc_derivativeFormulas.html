	<h3>Derivative Formulas</h3>
	<p>We can think of derivative formulas as falling into two categories: (1) the specific, and (2) the general. A specific formula provides a way to differentiate a specific example. For example, ${f(x) = x^n}$ has the derivative ${f'(x) = nx^{n-1}.}$</p>
	<p>In contrast, general formulas are those that apply to all functions. For example:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${(f + g)' = f' + g'}$</p>
			<p>${C \cdot u = C(u')}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>In the first formula above: The derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives of the two functions. And in the second: The derivative of a constant multiplied by a function is the constant multiplied by the derivative of the function. Both specific and general formulas are needed for polynomials.</p>

	<h3>Derivatives of the Trigonometric Functions</h3>
	<p>Let's consider differentiating the sine function:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} \sin x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>To differentiate this function, we use the familiar difference quotient, and apply the limit:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\sin (x + \Delta x) - \sin x}{\Delta x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>As we saw in the section on limits, we want to reframe this expression. The way to do so is with a trigonometric identity:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{(\sin x \cos (\Delta x) + \cos x \sin (\Delta x)) - \sin x}{\Delta x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We cannot just plug in 0 into this limit &mdash; it's one of the trickier ones. We must try and group the terms. To group terms, the first thing we want to do is gather what we know. From basic trigonometry, we know that ${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \cos(\Delta x)}$ is 1. We also see that ${\sin x}$ is a common term:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \sin x \left( \dfrac{\cos (\Delta x) - 1}{\Delta x} \right) + \cos x \left( \dfrac{\sin \Delta x}{\Delta x} \right)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From the last section we know the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \sin x \overbrace{\cancel{\left( \dfrac{\cos (\Delta x) - 1}{\Delta x} \right)}}^{0} + \cos x \overbrace{\cancel{\left( \dfrac{\sin \Delta x}{\Delta x} \right)}}^{1}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From the above, we have ${(\sin x \cdot 0) + (\cos x \cdot 1).}$ This gives us ${\cos x.}$ Thus, we have:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Let's now consider the derivative of ${\sin x.}$ </p>
