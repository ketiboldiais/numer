<h1>Integration</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		In this section, we examine the other half of calculus,
		<i>integral calculus</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To begin, we introduce some new notation. First, suppose we have the
		function ${y = f(x).}$ The <b>differential</b> of ${y}$ is denoted
		${dy,}$ where:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ dy = f'(x)dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		Because ${y}$ is equal to ${f(x),}$ we often read ${dy}$ as
		<q>the differential of ${f.}$</q> Notice that this notation looks
		similar to the notation for a derivative:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} dy &= f'(x)dx \\[1em] \dfrac{dy}{dx} &= f'(x)
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Indeed, the notations are closely related:</p>
	<figure>$$ dy = f'(x)dx \iff \dfrac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) $$</figure>
	<p>
		This close relationship is no accident. It stems directly from the
		Leibnizian (after the mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz)
		interpretation of the derivative: Derivatives are ratios of
		<i>differentials</i>. Hence the notation:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \dfrac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) $$</figure>
	<p>
		So ${dy}$ and ${dx}$ are differentials. But what is a differential? A
		differential is a kind of <b>infinitesimal</b>. We can think of an
		infinitesimal as something akin to an infinitely small quantity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Leibniz is credited with perfecting techniques for handling
		infinitesimals. In part because of how effective his notation was
		&mdash; when it comes to handling infinitesimals, Leibniz's notation is
		far, far more effective than Newton's.<sup></sup> In fact, so much so
		that some historians argue the reliance on Newton's notation set
		British mathematics behind continental Europe's by over a century.
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Constructing a notation system is an exercise in abstraction. A good
			notation system can significantly impact how easy or difficult a
			problem is &mdash; it allows its user to rapidly draw inferences,
			which is precisely how mathematics is done. It doesn't take much
			imagination to see why this is the case. If we had to write computer
			programs in binary &mdash; the language understood by computers
			&mdash; it's unlikely we'd see the myriad of technologies we see
			today.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		A good way to see how the notation works is through linear
		approximation. Recall how we used ${\Delta x}$ and ${\Delta y}$ to
		denote the change in ${x}$ and the change in ${y}$ respectively:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/newton_notation_infinitesimal.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is Newton's notation. With Leibniz notation, we replace ${\Delta
		x}$ with ${dx,}$ and ${\Delta y}$ with ${dy:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/leibniz_notation_infinitesimal.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>For example, consider the problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>What is ${(64.1)^{\frac{1}{3}}}$ approximately equal to?</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>We start by writing:</p>
	<figure>$$ y = x^{\frac{1}{3}} $$</figure>
	<p>With Leibniz notation, we <i>take the differential of ${y:}$</i></p>
	<figure>$$ dy = \dfrac{1}{3}x^{-\frac{2}{3}} dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		Following the same ideas we saw with linear approximations, we pick a
		starting point, say ${x = 64:}$
	</p>
	<figure>$$ y = 64^{\frac{1}{3}} = 4 $$</figure>
	<p>Returning to Leibniz notation, we get:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} dy &= \dfrac{1}{3} (64)^{- \frac{2}{3}}dx \\[1em] &=
		\dfrac{1}{3} \dfrac{1}{16} dx \\[1em] &= \dfrac{1}{48} dx \end{aligned}
		$$
	</figure>
	<p>Given ${x = 64,}$ our equation is:</p>
	<figure>$$ x + dx = 64.1 $$</figure>
	<p>This means that:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} x + dx &= 64.1 \\ 64 + dx &= 64.1 \\ dx &= 0.1
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Hence, we know that ${dx = 1/10.}$ This is the increment, or
		infinitesimal change, we're interested in. Carrying out the
		approximation. We know that ${dy = \dfrac{1}{48}dx,}$ so:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (64.1)^{\frac{1}{3}} &\approx y + dy \\[1em]
		&\approx 4 + \dfrac{1}{48}dx \\[1em] &\approx 4 + \dfrac{1}{48} \cdot
		\dfrac{1}{10} \\[1em] &\approx 4 + \dfrac{1}{480} \\[1em] &\approx
		4.002 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>

<section id="antiderivative">
	<h2>Antiderivative</h2>
	<p>Another piece of notation we'll introduce is the following:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \textcolor{lightblue}{G(x)} = \textcolor{#8FBC8F}{\int} g(x) dx $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the notation above, ${\textcolor{lightblue}{G(x)}}$ is called the
		<b>antiderivative</b> or <b>indefinite integral</b> of ${g(x).}$ The
		${\textcolor{#8FBC8F}{\int}}$ is the <b>integral symbol</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To understand what these terms mean, let's start with some examples.
		When see the expression:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \sin x~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		we read it as <q>the integral of ${\sin x.}$</q>
		<i
			>The integral of ${\sin x}$ is a function whose derivative is ${\sin
			x.}$
		</i>
		From our discussion of derivatives, we know that the derivative of ${-
		\cos x}$ is ${\sin x.}$ Accordingly, we say that ${- \cos x}$ is the
		antiderivative, or indefinite integral, of ${\sin x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>$$ G(x) = \int \sin x~dx = - \cos x $$</figure>
	<p>
		But why is it called <q>indefinite?</q> Because the derivative of a
		constant is zero, so we can add any constant to ${- \cos x}$ and still
		get the derivative ${\sin x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>$$ G(x) = \int \sin x~dx = - \cos x + C $$</figure>
	<p>
		Whenever we take the antiderivative of a function, it's ambiguous up to
		some constant. Let's consider another example. What does the expression
		evaluate to:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int x^a~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		This example is essentially asking us,
		<q>What function, when differentiated, yields ${x^a?}$</q> We know from
		the power rule that:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ (x^a)' = ax^{a-1}$$</figure>
	<p>Thus, to get ${x^a,}$ we need to cancel out the ${a:}$</p>
	<figure>$$ \int x^a~dx = \dfrac{1}{a+1}x^{a+1} $$</figure>
	<p>Checking our work using differential notation:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} d(x^{a+1}) &= (a+1)x^a~dx \\ (a+1)x^{a+1-1} &=
		(a+1)x^a~dx \\ \cancel{(a+1)}x^{a} &= \cancel{(a+1)}x^a~dx \\
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>And because we can add any constant, we must write:</p>
	<figure>$$ \int x^a~dx = \dfrac{1}{a+1}x^{a+1} + C $$</figure>
	<p>
		Furthermore, examining the antiderivative, we see a restriction. The
		proposition:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int x^a dx = \dfrac{1}{a+1} x^{a+1} + C $$</figure>
	<p>
		is true if, and only if, ${a \neq -1.}$ On the other hand, the
		proposition:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ d(x^{a+1}) = (a+1)x^a~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		contains no such restriction. Consider another problem. Evaluate the
		expression below:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{dx}{x} $$</figure>
	<p>
		The first step is to rewrite the expression into a more familiar form:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{1}{x}~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		Looking at this, we immediately see that the function we're looking for
		is ${\ln x}$ (don't forget the constant):
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{1}{x}~dx = \ln x + C$$</figure>
	<p>
		If we think carefully about the derivative of ${f(x) = \ln x,}$ we'd
		realize that we can also get the derivative ${f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}}$
		when ${x}$ is negative:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{d}{dx} \ln (-x) &= \dfrac{1}{-x} \cdot
		\dfrac{d}{dx} (-x) \\[1em] &= \dfrac{1}{-x} \cdot -1 \\[1em] &=
		\dfrac{-1}{-x} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{1}{x} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, the antiderivative is more properly written as:</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{1}{x}~dx = \ln\lvert x \rvert + C$$</figure>
	<p>Another example:</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \sec^2x~dx $$</figure>
	<p>Here we get:</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \sec^2x~dx = \tan x + C $$</figure>
	<p>
		The addition of a constant is the only ambiguous thing about
		antiderivatives.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we examine the antiderivative closely, we can draw a few inferences.
		Say we had some function ${F(x)}$ and another function ${G(x)}$ If
		${F'(x) = G'(x),}$ then it follows that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (F(x)-G(x))' &= F'(x) - G'(x) \\ &= 0 \end{aligned}
		$$
	</figure>
	<p>If ${(F(x)-G(x))' = 0,}$ then it must be the case that:</p>
	<figure>$$ F(x) - G(x) = C $$</figure>
	<p>Rearranging:</p>
	<figure>$$ F(x) = G(x) + C $$</figure>
	<p>In other words, ${F(x) - G(x)}$ results in a constant.<sup></sup></p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Notice that this was one of the lemmas we drew from the
			<cite>mean value theorem</cite>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		What this tells us is that the addition of a constant is the only
		ambiguous thing about antiderivatives. Beyond that constant, the
		antiderivative is <i>unique</i> &mdash; the antiderivative ${F(x),}$
		where ${F(x) = G(x) + C,}$ is the <em>only</em> antiderivative defined
		as ${G(x) + C.}$
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Antiderivative Uniqueness Theorem</small>
		<p>If ${F'(x) = G'(x),}$ then ${F(x) = G(x) + C.}$</p>

<section id="method_of_substitution">
	<h2>Integration Method: Substitution</h2>
	<p>
		In terms of symbolic manipulation, integration is much, much harder
		&mdash; if not impossible &mdash; compared to differentiation. As such,
		whenever we divine integrals, we must always do so gently and
		carefully. Fortunately, there are a few methods that can help us
		accomplish the task. One such method is the
		<b>method of substitution</b>. To illustrate this method, consider the
		following problem:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<p><small>problem</small> Evaluate the indefinite integral:</p>
		<figure>$$ \int x^3(x^4 + 2)^5 dx $$</figure>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		On its face, it looks like we can apply the power rule backwards. The
		trouble, however, is that fifth power. Expanding the ${(x^4+2)^5}$ is
		messy.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			It comes out to: ${ x^{20} + 10x^{16} + 40x^{12} + 80x^8 + 80x^4 + 32
			}$
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>The idea is to first define a new function for the messiest term:</p>
	<figure>$$ u = x^4 + 2 $$</figure>
	<p>Then we differentiate:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} d(u) &= d(x^4 + 2) \\ du &= 4x^3~dx \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can then <i>substitute</i> to simplify the indefinite integral.
		First, since ${u = x^4 + 2,}$ we substitute:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \int x^3(x^4+2)^5~dx &= \int
		\textcolor{firebrick}{(x^4 + 2)}^5 x^3~dx\\ &=
		\textcolor{firebrick}{u}^5 x^3~dx \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Next, given that ${du = 4x^3~dx,}$ we know that:</p>
	<figure>$$ \dfrac{du}{4} = x^3~dx $$</figure>
	<p>Thus:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \int x^3(x^4+2)^5~dx &= \int
		\textcolor{firebrick}{(x^4 + 2)}^5 \textcolor{teal}{x^3~dx}\\ &=
		\textcolor{firebrick}{u}^5 \cdot \textcolor{teal}{\dfrac{1}{4}~du}
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we have the integral:</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{u^5~du}{4} $$</figure>
	<p>This is much easier to integrate:</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{u^5~du}{4} = \dfrac{1}{24} u^6 + C $$</figure>
	<p>
		Now we have to change back to our original variable ${x.}$ Since we
		substituted ${u = x^4 + 2,}$ we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \int x^3(x^4 + 2)^5~dx = \dfrac{1}{24}(x^4 + 2)^6 + C $$
	</figure>

	<section id="p_substitution">
		<h3>Premonitory Substitution</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes, the substitution method is either (1) too long to perform,
			or (2) doesn't appear to yield further progress. For example,
			consider the following problem:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<p><small>problem</small> Evaluate the indefinite integral:</p>
			<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{x~dx}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} $$</figure>
		</dfn>
		<p>In this case, let's substitute ${1+x^2:}$</p>
		<figure>$$ u = 1+x^2 $$</figure>
		<p>Differentiating, we get:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} d(u) &= d(1+x^2) \\ du &= 2x~dx \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Expressing ${x~dx}$ in terms of ${du:}$</p>
		<figure>$$ \dfrac{du}{2} = x~dx $$</figure>
		<p>And substituting all our findings:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \int \dfrac{\dfrac{du}{2}}{\sqrt{u}} = \int \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot
			\dfrac{du}{\sqrt{u}} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			This doesn't seem to have helped. We've gotten an integral that looks
			just as nasty as the original. Fortunately, there's a modified
			version of the subsitution we can use &mdash;
			<b>premonitory substitution</b>. The idea is that we first look at
			the integral:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{x~dx}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} $$</figure>
		<p>
			We easily see that the troublesome part is that radicand in the
			bottom, so we make a <i>guess</i>, or <i>premonition</i>, that the
			substituted form will look something like:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ (1+x^2)^{\frac{1}{2}} $$</figure>
		<p>With this guess, we just differentiate and see if it works:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{d}{dx} [(1+x^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}] &=
			\dfrac{1}{2}(1+x^2)^{- \frac{1}{2}}(2x) \\[1em] &=
			\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Lo and behold, there's our original expression. The answer is thus:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \int \dfrac{x~dx}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \dfrac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} + C $$
		</figure>
		<p>Let's look at another example:</p>
		<figure>$$ \int e^{6x}~dx $$</figure>
		<p>We start with a guess for the answer:</p>
		<figure>$$ e^{6x} $$</figure>
		<p>If we differentiate this answer:</p>
		<figure>$$ \dfrac{d}{dx}(e^{6x}) = 6e^{6x} $$</figure>
		<p>
			Just looking at this derivative, all we have to do is get rid of the
			${6.}$ Thus, the answer is:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ \int e^{6x}~dx = \dfrac{1}{6}e^{6x} + C $$</figure>
		<p>Let's look at another example:</p>
		<dfn>
			<p><small>problem</small> Evaluate the indefinite integral:</p>
			<figure>$$ \int xe^{-x^2}~dx $$</figure>
		</dfn>
		<p>Let's start with a guess:</p>
		<figure>$$ e^{-x^2} $$</figure>
		<p>Differentiating this guess:</p>
		<figure>$$ \dfrac{d}{dx}e^{-x^2} = e^{-x^2}(-2x) $$</figure>
		<p>
			Examining this derivative, we see that we're off by a factor of
			${-2.}$ So, we have the derivative:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ \int xe^{-x^2}~dx = - \dfrac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} + C $$</figure>
		<p>Let's look at another problem.</p>
		<dfn>
			<p><small>problem</small> Evaluate the indefinite integral:</p>
			<figure>$$ \int \sin x \cos x ~dx $$</figure>
		</dfn>
		<p>We begin with a guess.</p>
		<figure>$$ \sin^2 x $$</figure>
		<p>Then we differentiate:</p>
		<figure>$$ \dfrac{d}{dx} \sin^2 x = 2 \sin x \cos x $$</figure>
		<p>We see that we're off by a factor of ${2,}$ so our answer is:</p>
		<figure>$$ \int \sin x \cos x~dx = \dfrac{1}{2}\sin^2 x + C $$</figure>
		<p>
			This problem, however, could've been approached differently and
			yielded a different answer. If our guess were instead:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ \cos^2x $$</figure>
		<p>we would've gotten the derivative:</p>
		<figure>$$ \dfrac{d}{dx} \cos^2x = 2 \cos x(- \sin x) $$</figure>
		<p>Thus, another answer is:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \int \sin x \cos x~dx = -\dfrac{1}{2} \cos^2x + C $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			This is interesting. How are we getting two different answers? It
			turns out that these two answers are actually just different forms of
			the answer. If we set the answers equal to one another:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{1}{2} \sin^2 x + C_1 &= -\dfrac{1}{2}
			\cos^2 x + C_2 \\[1em] \left(\dfrac{1}{2} \sin^2 x + C_1\right) -
			\left(-\dfrac{1}{2} \cos^2 x + C_2\right) &= 0 \\[1em] \dfrac{1}{2}
			\sin^2 x + C_1 + \dfrac{1}{2} \cos^2 x - C_2 &= 0 \\[1em]
			\dfrac{1}{2} \sin^2 x + \dfrac{1}{2} \cos^2 x + C_1 - C_2 &= 0
			\\[1em] \dfrac{1}{2}(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x) + C_1 - C_2 &= 0 \\[1em]
			\dfrac{1}{2}(1) + C_1 - C_2 &= 0 \\[1em] C_1 - C_2 &= -\dfrac{1}{2}
			\\[1em] \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			The difference between the two answers is a constant. In other words,
			the only difference between these two answers is their constant
			${C.}$ This tells us that the two formulas:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} &(\text{1a})~~~~\int \sin x \cos x~dx =
			-\dfrac{1}{2} \cos^2x + C \\[1.5em] &(\text{1b})~~~~\int \sin x \cos
			x~dx = \dfrac{1}{2}\sin^2 x + C \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			are different forms of the answer, merely differing from one another
			by ${-\dfrac{1}{2}.}$
		</p>
		<p>Here's another example:</p>
		<dfn>
			<p><small>problem</small> Evaluate the indefinite integral:</p>
			<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{dx}{x \ln x} $$</figure>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			Here, we might be tempted to make a guess, but this is best solved
			with just plain substitution. Remember, premonitory substitution is
			what we use when it's apparent that plain substitution doesn't work.
			Recall what we said earlier about integration:
			<i>We must take care when integrating.</i> <em>Do not</em> rush into
			premonitory substitution. Here, a clear substitution is:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ u = \ln x $$</figure>
		<p>The differential here is simpler:</p>
		<figure>$$ du = \dfrac{dx}{x} $$</figure>
		<p>Applying the substitution:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \int \dfrac{dx}{x \ln x} &= \int
			\underbrace{\dfrac{1}{\ln x}}_{\dfrac{1}{u}} ~\cdot~
			\underbrace{\dfrac{dx}{x}}_{\normalsize du} \\[4em] &= \int
			\dfrac{du}{u} \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Evaluating the substituted integral:</p>
		<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{du}{u} = \ln u + C $$</figure>
		<p>Re-substituting:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \int \dfrac{du}{u} &= \ln u + C \\[1em] &= \ln
			(\ln x) + C \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Thus, we have the answer:</p>
		<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{dx}{x \ln x} = \ln (\ln x) + C $$</figure>
		<p>Or more correctly:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \int \dfrac{dx}{x \ln x} = \ln\lvert \ln x \rvert + C $$
		</figure>

	<h2>Introduction to Differential Equations</h2>
	<p>
		Now that we some understanding of differentials, we can get a taste of
		another mathematical field &mdash; <i>differential equations</i>. A
		<b>differential equation</b> is an equation &mdash; and more generally,
		a proposition &mdash; the communicates the relationship between some
		function and one or more of its derivative(s).<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			A differential equation can contain one function, and one or more of
			its derivatives, or many functions, and one or more of their
			derivatives.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>The simplest differential equation is the following:</p>
	<figure>$$ \dfrac{dy}{dx} = f(x) $$</figure>
	<p>The solution for this equation is the <b>antiderivative</b>:</p>
	<figure>$$ y = \int f(x)~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		Because we're just getting a taste for differential equations, we will
		treat the solution ${y = \int f(x)~dx}$ as <i>solved</i> or
		<i>complete</i>. In other words, nothing further needs to be done.
		We're satisfied with the solution ${y = \int f(x)~dx.}$ For that same
		reason, we will only discuss one technique and its varianet for finding
		antiderivatives &mdash; <i>substitution</i> and
		<i>premonitory substitution</i> (the same techniques we saw earlier).
	</p>
	<p>Here's a more interesting example:</p>
	<dfn>
		<p><small>problem</small> Determine the solution for the equation:</p>
		<figure>$$ \left( \dfrac{d}{dx} + x \right)y = 0 $$</figure>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		We read the equation above as,
		<q
			>${d~}$ by ${~dx~}$ plus ${~x,~}$ acting on ${~y,~}$ is equal to
			zero.</q
		>
		Examining the equation, the portion of the equation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \textcolor{salmon}{\left( \dfrac{d}{dx} + x \right)}y = 0 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		is called the <b>annihilation operator</b> in quantum mechanics. If the
		equation were instead:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \textcolor{cornflowerblue}{\left( \dfrac{d}{dx} - x \right)}y = 0 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		we see the <b>creation operator</b>. These equations are very simple
		differential equations with easily determined solutions.
	</p>
	<p>Returning to our original problem, we can rewrite the equation as:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \left( \dfrac{d}{dx} + x \right)y &= 0 \\[1em] y
		\cdot \dfrac{d}{dx} + y \cdot x &= 0 \\[1em] \dfrac{dy}{dx} + xy &= 0

	<p>Solving for ${\dfrac{dy}{dx}:}$</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{dy}{dx} + xy &= 0 \\[1em] \dfrac{dy}{dx} &=
		-xy \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Following this step, we want to <i>separate the variables:</i></p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{dy}{dx} &= -xy \\[1em] \cancel{(dx)}\left(
		\dfrac{1}{y} \right) \dfrac{dy}{\cancel{dx}} &= -x\cancel{y} \left(
		\dfrac{1}{\cancel{y}} \right)(dx) \\[1em] \dfrac{dy}{y} &= -x~dx
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Writing the equation in this form:</p>
	<figure>$$ \dfrac{dy}{y} = -x~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		we've rewritten the equation in terms of <i>differentials</i> rather
		than <i>ratios of differentials</i>. This allows us to integrate the
		differentials:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \int \dfrac{dy}{y} = \int -x~dx $$</figure>
	<p>These are both easy integrals to evaluate:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \int \dfrac{dy}{y} &= - \int x~dx \\ \ln y &= -
		\dfrac{x^2}{2} + C \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that we only need one constant ${C.}$ Now we have to
		exponentiate to express ${y}$ in terms of ${x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln y &= -\dfrac{x^2}{2} + C \\[2em] e^{\ln y} &=
		e^{-x^2/2 + C} \\[1em] y &= a e^{x^2/2}~~~~~~(a=e^C,~y &gt; 0)
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>With that, we have the solution:</p>
	<figure>$$ y = ae^{-x^2/2} $$</figure>
	<p>where ${a}$ is any real number constant.</p>

	<h2>Definite Integrals</h2>
	<p>
		Definite integrals are best introduced by first presenting the problem
		they are intended to solve: Finding the area under a curve. Consider
		the diagram below.
	</p>
	<figure>

		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here, we're visualizing the graph of some function ${y = f(x).}$ Along
		the graph are some points ${x = a}$ and ${x = b.}$ The area under the
		curve is shaded pink, and is denoted:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \Large \int_a^b f(x) ~dx $$</figure>
	<p>
		The entire expression above is called a <b>definite integral</b>. The
		function ${f(x)}$ is called the <b>integrand</b>, the points ${a}$ and
		${b}$ are called the <b>limits</b> or <b>bounds</b> of the integral,
		and the ${dx,}$ a differential, indicates that the variable of
		integration is ${x.}$ Given the bounds ${a}$ and ${b,}$ we say that the
		integral is over the interval ${[a, b].}$ The interval ${[a,b]}$ is
		called the <b>interval of integration</b>.
	</p>
	<p>To compute the area, we use the following algorithm:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Divide the area into <q>rectangles.</q></li>
		<li>Add the areas of the rectangles.</li>
		<li>Take the limit as the rectangles get infinitely thin.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For example, suppose we had the following curve:</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="{% static 'images/rectify_1.svg' %}" alt="" loading="lazy" />
	</figure>
	<p>
		To find the area beneath the curve over the interval ${[a,b],}$ we
		start by dividing it into rectangles:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="{% static 'images/rectify_2.svg' %}" alt="" loading="lazy" />
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that some of the rectangles go beyond the curve. If we summate
		the area for each of these rectangles as is, the area under the curve
		would be over the actual area. This is where taking the limit comes in.
		If we make the rectangles thinner, we reduce any over and under
		estimation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="{% static 'images/rectify_3.svg' %}" alt="" loading="lazy" />
	</figure>
	<p>
		At some point, the rectangles are so infinitesimally thin that any
		excess area is neglibile.
