	<h3>Limits &amp; Continuity</h3>
	<span class="marginnote">The earliest evidence of the concept of a limit dates to the 3 B.C. to measure volumes of spheres. Archimedes of Syracuse posultated that if you could carve the spheres into smaller pieces and approximated the volumes of those pieces, then increasing the number of pieces would return the volume of the overall sphere (i.e., the limit of the sum of the smaller pieces).</span>
	<p>
		In this section, we revisit the concept of a limit and continuity. So far,
		we've been using these ideas somewhat sloppily. To make best use of these
		concepts, we must subject them to more rigorous treatment.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some limits are relatively easy to compute, in that we simply substitute:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\lim\limits_{x \to 2} \dfrac{x^2 + 3}{x + 1} = \dfrac{(2)^2 + 3}{(2) +
				1} = \dfrac{4 + 3}{3} = \dfrac{7}{3}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		In other situations, however, the limit is more difficult to think about.
