<h1>Derivative Formulas</h1>
<section id="intro_derivative_formulas">
	<p>
		We can think of derivative formulas as falling into two categories: (1) the
		specific, and (2) the general. A specific formula provides a way to
		differentiate a specific example. For example, ${f(x) = x^n}$ has the
		derivative ${f'(x) = nx^{n-1}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, general formulas are those that apply to all functions. For
		example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${(f + g)' = f' + g'}$</p>
			<p>${C \cdot u = C(u')}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the first formula above: The derivative of the sum of two functions is
		the sum of the derivatives of the two functions. And in the second: The
		derivative of a constant multiplied by a function is the constant multiplied
		by the derivative of the function. Both specific and general formulas are
		needed for polynomials.

	<h2>The Product Rule</h2>
	<p>
		It may be tempting to think that the derivative of a product is the product
		of the derivatives. This is wrong, and we've already seen why. Given the
		function ${f(x) = x^2,}$ the derivative of ${f}$ is ${f'(x) = 2x.}$ However,
		the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = x \cdot x.}$ If it
		were the case the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives,
		then we would have ${\frac{d}{dx} (x^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(x) \cdot
		\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.}$ Wrong. So what is the rule for products?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, let's apply the definition of a derivative. Suppose we have two
		functions, ${f(x)}$ and ${g(x),}$ both of which are differentiable. Now let's say that the function ${k(x)}$
		is the product of these two functions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${k(x) = f(x)g(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now apply the definition of a derivative to the function ${k(x):}$</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's apply the old trick of adding zero. We add and subtracting ${f(x)g(x +
		h)}$ in the numerator:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x + h) +
				f(x)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Using the associative property, let's group the terms to break the quotient:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x
				+ h)}{h} \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x)g(x + h) -
				f(x)g(x)}{h} \right)}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying the associative property again:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \cdot
				g(x + h) \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{g(x + h) -
				g(x)}{h} \cdot f(x) \right) }$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now, we know that ${g(x)}$ is differentiable (by assumption), so it follows that ${g(x)}$ is continuous. And since ${g(x)}$ is continuous, ${\lim\limits_{h \to 0}g(x + h) = g(x).}$ Hence:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$
				\begin{aligned}
				k'(x) &= \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}}_{f'(x)} \cdot
				\underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} g(x + h)}}_{g(x)} + \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x + h) -
				g(x)}{h}}}_{g'(x)} \cdot \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} f(x)}}_{f(x)} \\
				&= f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)
				\end{aligned} 
			$$

		We now have a general derivative formula, the
		<span class="term">product rule</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Product Rule.</span> Given functions ${f}$ and
				${g,}$ the derivative of ${fg,}$ denoted ${(fg)',}$ is the sum of the

				words:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${(fg)' = f'g + fg'}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, suppose we are given the functions ${f(x) = x^n}$ and ${g(x) =
		\sin x.}$ The product of these functions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(f \cdot g)(x) = x^n \sin x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>What is the derivative of ${(f \cdot g)?}$ We apply the product rule:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(f \cdot g)' = f'g + fg'}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{(f \cdot g)'} = (x^n)' \sin x + (x^n) (\sin x)}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{(f \cdot g)'} = (nx^{n-1})(\sin x) + (x^n)(\cos x)}$</p>
