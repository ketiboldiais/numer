<h1>Derivative Formulas</h1>
<section id="intro_derivative_formulas">
	<p>
		We can think of derivative formulas as falling into two categories: (1) the
		specific, and (2) the general. A specific formula provides a way to
		differentiate a specific example. For example, ${f(x) = x^n}$ has the
		derivative ${f'(x) = nx^{n-1}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, general formulas are those that apply to all functions. For
		example:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${(f + g)' = f' + g'}$</p>
			<p>${C \cdot u = C(u')}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the first formula above: The derivative of the sum of two functions is
		the sum of the derivatives of the two functions. And in the second: The
		derivative of a constant multiplied by a function is the constant multiplied
		by the derivative of the function. Both specific and general formulas are
		needed for polynomials.
	</p>

<section id="sum_rule">
	<h2>The Sum Rule</h2>
	<p>
		What is the derivative of ${f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2?}$ To compute this
		derivative, we must apply the
		<span class="term">sum rule for derivatives</span>. To do so, let's derive
		the general rule. The function ${f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2}$ can be written as the
		sum of two functions: Suppose ${g(x) = 3x^3}$ and ${j(x) = 2x^2.}$ Then
		${f(x) = g(x) + j(x).}$ That said, we apply the definition of a derivative:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we substitute ${f(x + h) = g(x + h) + j(x + h)}$ and ${f(x) = g(x) +
		j(x):}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{(f(x + h) + g(x + h)) - (f(x) +
				g(x))}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Rearranging:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} +
				\dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \right)}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>And applying the sum law for limits and the definition of a derivative:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} f'(x) &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left(
			\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0}\left(
			\dfrac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} \right) \\[1em] &= f'(x) + g'(x) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The above derivation yields the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Sum Rule for Derivatives.</span> Let ${f(x)}$ and
				${g(x)}$ be differentiable functions. Then the derivative of the sum of
				${f}$ and ${g}$ is the sum of the derivative of ${f}$ and the derivative

			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>
						${\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x)) = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) +
						\dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Alternatively, given the differentiable functions ${r(x),}$ ${s(x),}$
				and ${t(x),}$ and ${r(x) = s(x) + t(x),}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${r'(x) = s'(x) + t'(x)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, returning to our original question, what is the derivative of ${f(x) =
		3x^3 + 2x^2,}$ the derivative is simply the derivative of each term:
	</p>

		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x,}$ by the sum rule and the power rule.</p>

	<h2>The Difference Rule</h2>
	<p>
		Now let's consider the opposite of addition: What is the derivative of
		${p(x) = 2x^5 - x^3?}$ Here too we can think of ${p(x)}$ as consisting of
		two separate functions: Given ${q(x) = 2x^5}$ and ${r(x) = x^3,}$ ${p(x) =
		q(x) - r(x).}$ Again we apply the definition of a derivative:

			<p>${p'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{p(x + h) - p(x)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>

		Now substitute: ${p(x + h) = q(x + h) - r(x + h)}$ and ${p(x) = q(x) -

	<p>Then rearranging:</p>

				${p'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{q(x + h) - q(x)}{h} -

	<p>Applying the sum law for limits and the definition of a derivative:</p>

			$$ \begin{aligned} p'(x) &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left(\dfrac{q(x + h) -

<section id="constant_multiple_rule">
	<h2>Constant Multiple Rule</h2>
	<p>
		What is the derivative of ${f(x) = x^3 - x^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)?}$
		This may seem complex, but we know enough to handle this. To begin with, the
		term ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$ is just a constant. Thus, we can really write this
		function as: ${f(x) = C(g(x)),}$ where ${g(x) = x^3 - x^2}$ and ${C =
		\dfrac{\pi}{2}.}$ Let's come up with a rule for computing the derivative of
		${f(x) = C(g(x)).}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Because we can factor out constants from limits, applying the derivative
		definition is straightforward. First, the derivative of ${f'(x)}$ is the
		derivative ${(C(g(x)))'.}$ Thus:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} f'(x) = (C(g(x)))' &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{Cg(x
			+ h) - Cg(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= C \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x+h) -
			g(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= Cg'(x) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From our derivation above, we have the following rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Constant Multiple Rule.</span> Given the function
				${Cf(x),}$ where ${f(x)}$ is differentiable and ${C}$ is a constant:
			</p>
			<figure>

					<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx}Cf(x) = C \cdot \dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, the derivative of ${f(x) = x^3 - x^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}$ is a
		simple application of the constant multiple rule, difference rule, and power
		rule:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) = (3x^2 - 2x)\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}$</p>

<section id="product_rule">
	<h2>The Product Rule</h2>
	<p>
		It may be tempting to think that the derivative of a product is the product
		of the derivatives. This is wrong, and we've already seen why. Given the
		function ${f(x) = x^2,}$ the derivative of ${f}$ is ${f'(x) = 2x.}$ However,
		the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = x \cdot x.}$ If it
		were the case the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives,
		then we would have ${\frac{d}{dx} (x^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(x) \cdot
		\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.}$ Wrong. So what is the rule for products?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, let's apply the definition of a derivative. Suppose we have two
		functions, ${f(x)}$ and ${g(x),}$ both of which are differentiable. Now
		let's say that the function ${k(x)}$ is the product of these two functions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${k(x) = f(x)g(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now apply the definition of a derivative to the function ${k(x):}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's apply the old trick of adding zero. We add and subtracting ${f(x)g(x +
		h)}$ in the numerator:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x + h) +
				f(x)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Using the associative property, let's group the terms to break the quotient:
	</p>

	<div style="overflow: auto">
		<p>
			${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x +
			h)}{h} \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x)g(x + h) -
			f(x)g(x)}{h} \right)}$
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>Applying the associative property again:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \cdot
				g(x + h) \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{g(x + h) -
				g(x)}{h} \cdot f(x) \right) }$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, we know that ${g(x)}$ is differentiable (by assumption), so it follows
		that ${g(x)}$ is continuous. And since ${g(x)}$ is continuous,
		${\lim\limits_{h \to 0}g(x + h) = g(x).}$ Hence:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} k'(x) &= \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0}
			\dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}}_{f'(x)} \cdot
			\underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} g(x + h)}}_{g(x)} +
			\underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x + h) -
			g(x)}{h}}}_{g'(x)} \cdot \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0}
			f(x)}}_{f(x)} \\ &= f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We now have a general derivative formula, the
		<span class="term">product rule</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Product Rule.</span> Given functions ${f}$ and

<section id="quotient_rule">
	<h2>Quotient Rule</h2>
	<p>
		What is the derivative of ${t(x) = \dfrac{5x + 1}{3x - 4}?}$ For this, we
		need another rule. Never, ever, ever, think that ${\frac{d}{dx}

<section id="chain_rule">
	<h2>Chain Rule</h2>

	<p>
		In many of the previous examples, we
		<span class="italicsText">abstracted</span> the function's terms to arrive
		at a more general rule. For example, given the function ${f(x) = x^3 -
		(1/x),}$ we would write ${f(x) = t(x) - s(x),}$ where ${t(x) = x^3}$ and
		${s(x) = 1/x.}$ We would then arrive at a derivative from this more
		abstracted form. This technique results from two observations: First, every
		function can be expressed as the combination of smaller functions. Borrowing
		from computer science, we might call these smaller functions
		<span class="italicsText">helper functions</span>. For example, silly as it
		may be, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = g(x),}$ where
		${g(x) = x^2.}$ Or it can be written as ${f(x) = (g(x))^2}$, where ${g(x) =
		x.}$ Second, there are really only three ways to
		<span class="underlineText">combine</span> functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, we can <span class="italicsText">add</span> functions. For example,
		the function ${f(x) = \sin x + x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = g(x) +
		h(x),}$ where ${g(x) = \sin x}$ and ${h(x) = x^2.}$ The ability to add
		functions implies the ability to subtract functions, since addition is
		really just the addition of a negative. For example, the function ${a(x) =
		x^3 - x^2}$ can be written as ${a(x) = b(x) + c(x),}$ where ${b(x) = x^3}$
		and ${c(x) = -x^2.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, we can <span class="italicsText">multiply</span> functions. The
		function ${\alpha(x) = (\sin x)(x^2)}$ can be written as ${\alpha(x) =
		\beta(x) \gamma(x),}$ where ${\beta(x) = \sin x}$ and ${\gamma(x) = x^2.}$
		The ability to multiply functions implies the ability to divide functions,
		since division is just multiplication with the reciprocal. The function
		${L(x) = \dfrac{\sin x}{x^5}}$ can be written as ${L(x) = M(x) \cdot N(x)}$
		where ${M(x) = \sin x}$ and ${N(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^5}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Third, we can <span class="italicsText">compose</span>, or
		<span class="italicsText">nest</span>, functions. For example, the function
		${f(x) = (x^2 - 1)^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = (g(x))^2,}$ where ${g(x) =
		x^2 - 1.}$ Similarly, the function ${\kappa(x) = \sin (x^3)}$ can be written
		as ${\kappa(x) = \sin (\lambda(x)),}$ where ${\lambda(x) = x^3.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Borrowing again from computer science, these are the three
		<span class="italicsText">means of combination</span>. The remarkable aspect
		of functions is that every function can be written and rewritten, or
		expressed, with just these three means.
	</p>
	<p>
		So far, we've used our abstraction technique for the first two means:
		addition and multiplication. What we haven't used it for, however, is with
		composition. This limitation leads to some problems. We haven't yet seen a
		way to apply the technique to a function like ${s(a) = (a^2 - 1)^2.}$
		Fortunately, we can simply expand this function: ${s(a) = a^4 - 2a^2 + 1,}$
		then apply our familiar rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Expansion, however, begins falling apart once we have something like
		${(29a^4 - 17a^3 + 32a^2 - 17)^{15}.}$ This is a polynomial that would be
		messy to expand. We'd sooner exhaust ourselves before seeing the
		polynomial's final form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Worse, neither expansion nor our original method of generalization would
		help with functions like ${f(x) = \cos (x^2)}$ or ${t(x) = \tan
		\left(\dfrac{1}{2x^3 - x}\right).}$ With the rules we have thus far, it
		isn't exactly clear how we would compute the derivatives for these
		functions. All these functions are called
		<span class="term">composite functions</span> &mdash; functions combined
		through composition, or nesting. The most efficient way to compute their
		derivatives is with a new theorem: the <span class="term">chain rule</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To understand the chain rule, we must first review how composite functions
		work. Composite functions are simply compositions of functions. Our original
		method of generalization is applicable to composing functions. With the
		composite function ${y = (x^3 - 1)^{100},}$ we generalize ${x^3 - 1}$ to ${u
		= x^3 - 1.}$ Following this generalization, ${y = u^{100}.}$ Now, let's
		compute ${\dfrac{dy}{du}:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${y = u^{100}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{dy}{du} = 100u^{99}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		That was a straightforward application of the power rule. Now let's compute
		the derivative of ${\dfrac{du}{dx}:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u = x^3 - 1}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{du}{dx} = u' = 3x^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>So now we have these two results:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="compare">
			<p>${\dfrac{dy}{du} = 100u^{99}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{du}{dx} = u' = 3x^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		But, what we ultimately want to find is ${\dfrac{dy}{dx}.}$ Now, notice the
		way Leibniz's notation looks:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="compare">
			<p>${\dfrac{dy}{du}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{du}{dx}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Those look an awful lot like fractions, and it's tempting to multiply them
		and cancel:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{dy}{\cancel{du}} \cdot \dfrac{\cancel{du}}{dx} =
				\dfrac{dy}{dx}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's put a pin on this observation for now, but we'll revisit it shortly.
		What we should do instead is think a little more carefully about what it
		means to compute the derivative of a nested function, say ${f(g(x)).}$ If
		suppose that ${y = g(x),}$ then ${f(g(x)) = f(y).}$ Looking at it this way,
		we can see that ${g(x)}$ outputs a ${y,}$ and that ${y}$ is an input for
		${f.}$ Now let's say that ${z = f(x).}$ Viewing it this way, when we ask for
		the derivative of ${f(g(x)),}$ what we're really asking for is, how quickly
		(or slowly), does ${f}$ change as ${x}$ changes?
	</p>
	<p>
		The answer to that question is the derivative. We know that a derivative is
		simply the application of a limit to the quotient rule. Thus, what we want
		to do is to consider the Newton quotient of the compositve function ${f
		\circ g:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				Suppose ${f}$ has a derivative at ${g(x)}$ and ${g}$ has a derivative at
				${x.}$ Then, by Newton's quotient:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>
						${\dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = \dfrac{f(g(x + h)) - f(g(x))}{h}}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This expression is a bit of an eye sore, so we'll replace some of the terms
		with simpler variables. Suppose:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u = g(x)}$</p>
			<p>${k = g(x + h) - g(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that with the above substitutions, ${k}$ depends on ${h.}$ As ${h}$
		approaches 0, ${k}$ tends to 0. Bearing this in mind, we can the
		corresponding terms and arrive at the following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This looks very similar to the derivative ${f'(u),}$ but we have ${h}$ in
		the denominator and ${k}$ in the numerator. Recall that ${k}$ depends on
		${h.}$ And because ${k}$ depends on ${h,}$ we have two cases to consider:
		${k = 0}$ and ${k \neq 0.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The easier (and more common) case is when ${k \neq 0,}$ so let's deal with
		it it first. Suppose ${k \neq 0.}$ If ${k \neq 0,}$ then we can multiply and
		divide the our equation by ${k:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{k} \cdot \dfrac{k}{h} = \dfrac{f(u + k) -
			f(u)}{k} \cdot \dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Examining the resulting equation, when ${h}$ approaches ${0,}$ several
		things occur. First, the quotient:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		tends to ${g'(x).}$ Second, ${k \to 0}$ (&#8220;${k}$ tends towards
		0&#8221;) as ${h \to 0}$ because ${k = g(x + h) - g(x)}$ and ${g}$ is
		continuous at ${x}$ (by our first assumptions). Thus, the quotient:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>approaches ${g'(x)}$ as ${h \to 0,}$ and the quotient:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{k}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>approaches ${f'(u)}$ as ${h \to 0.}$ Hence, we have the following rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The above rule, however, only applies when ${k \neq 0.}$ We must still
		consider the case where ${k = 0.}$ This is somewhat of an edge case, but
		because the possibility exists, we must address it. Otherwise, our preceding
		wouldn't apply.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, say we have a number ${u}$ such that ${f(u)}$ is defined. By the
		limit of Newton's quotient, we know that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{k} = f'(u)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Encapsulating the above:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\varphi(k) = \dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{k} - f'(u)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		It follows then that, as ${k}$ approaches 0, ${\varphi(k) = 0.}$ In other
		words:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\lim\limits_{k \to 0} \varphi(k) = \dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{k} - f'(u)
				= 0}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Multiplying both sides by ${k,}$ we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${k \cdot \varphi(k) = f(u + k) - f(u) - kf'(u)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can rewrite this as:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(u + k) - f(u) = k \cdot f'(u) + k \cdot \varphi(k)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Consider what happens when ${k \neq 0.}$ The equation is holds. But if ${k =
		0,}$ the equation breaks down, because ${\varphi(k)}$ leaves a 0 in the
		denominator. We can avoid this by supposing that ${\varphi(k) = 0,}$ in
		which case the equation holds when ${k = 0,}$ since doing so would simply
		yield:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(u) - f(u) = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Of course, this is true. With this in mind, let's say ${u = g(x)}$ and ${k =
		g(x + h) - g(x).}$ Then as ${h}$ tends towards 0, so too does ${k.}$ Now,
		recall that the Newton quotient for the function ${f \circ g}$ is:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{f(g(x + h)) - f(g(x))}{h} = \dfrac{f(u + k) - f(u)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Based on our previous analysis, it follows that:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{f(g(x + h)) - f(g(x))}{h} &= \dfrac{f(u + k) -
			f(u)}{h} \\ &= \dfrac{k \cdot f'(u) + k \cdot \varphi(k)}{h} \end{aligned}
			$$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Substituting the value for ${k,}$ we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{f(g(x + h)) - f(g(x))}{h} &= \dfrac{f(u + k) -
			f(u)}{h} \\ &= \dfrac{k \cdot f'(u) + k \cdot \varphi(k)}{h} \\ &=
			\dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} f'(u) + \dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x) - g(x)}{h}
			\varphi(k) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we take the limit as ${h}$ as 0. Applying this limit, we see that the
		first term approaches ${g'(x)f'(u).}$ Given that the limit of ${\varphi(k)}$
		as ${h \to 0}$ or ${k \to 0}$ is 0, applying the limit to the second term
		results in:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \varphi(k) = g'(x)
				\cdot 0 = 0}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we have the rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f \circ g(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Formally stating this rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Chain Rule.</span> Suppose ${f}$ and ${g}$ are
				functions. For all ${x}$ in the domain of ${g}$ for which ${g}$ is
				differentiable at ${x}$ and ${f}$ is differentiable at ${g(x),}$ the
				derivative of the composite function ${h(x) = (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))}$
				is given by:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Alternatively, if ${y}$ is a function of ${u,}$ and ${u}$ is a function
				of ${x,}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{dy}{du} \cdot \dfrac{du}{dx}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Once more we see that the chain rule applies even when ${k = 0.}$ This
		proves that the chain rule applies in general. Having proved the chain rule,
		we can now see that we can rest easy succumbing to our previous temptation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{dy}{\cancel{du}} \cdot \dfrac{\cancel{du}}{dx} =
				\dfrac{dy}{dx}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>This is because the chain rule can be expressed by the formula:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d(f \circ g)}{dx} = \dfrac{df}{du} \cdot \dfrac{du}{dx}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With the chain rule, derivatives of composite functions behave as if we
		could cancel ${du.}$ For example, suppose we're asked to compute the
		following derivative:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} (3x^2 - 4)^{100}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can compute this derivative quickly with the chain rule. First, we need
		the two terms, ${\dfrac{dy}{du}}$ and ${\dfrac{du}{dx}.}$ The variable ${u}$
		embodies the outer function. ${u = 3x^2 - 4.}$ Thus:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{d}{dx} (3x^2 - 4)^{100} &= \dfrac{dy}{du} \cdot
			\dfrac{du}{dx} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{d}{du}(u^{100}) \cdot \dfrac{d}{dx}(3x^2
			- 4) \\[1em] &= 100u^{99} \cdot 6x \\[1em] &= 100(3x^2 - 4)^{99} \cdot 6x
			\\[1em] &= 600x(3x^2 - 4)^{99} \end{aligned} $$

	<h2>Higher-order Derivatives</h2>
	<p>
		The mathematician Hugo Rossi famously quipped, &#8220;In the fall of 1972,
		President Nixon announced that the rate of increase of inflation was
		decreasing. This was the first time a sitting president used the third
		derivative to advance his case for reelection.&#8221; What is this third
		derivative? It's simply a derivative of a derivative &mdash; a
		<span class="term">higher-order derivative</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Higher derivatives are denoted ordinally. I.e., the &#8220;second
		derivative,&#8221; the &#8220;third derivative,&#8221; etc. For example,
		<span class="italicsText">velocity</span> is the first derivative of the
		position vector with respect to time, representing the change in an object's
		position over time. <span class="italicsText">Acceleration</span> is the
		second derivative of the position vector with respect to time, representing
		the moving object's change in velocity (e.g., how fast does this car go from
		0mph to 100mph?). <span class="italicsText">Jerk</span> is the third
		derivative of the position vector with respect to time, representing the
		change in acceleration. Somewhat humorously and non-standardized: A
		<span class="italicsText">snap</span> is the fourth derivative representing
		the change in jerk. <span class="italicsText">Crackle</span> is the fifth
		derivative representing the change in snap.
		<span class="italicsText">Pop</span> is the sixth derivative representing
		the change in crackle.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rules we've covered thus far equally apply to the computation of
		higher-order derivatives. For example, given ${u(x) = \sin x,}$ the first
		derivative is ${u' = \cos x.}$ The second derivative is ${(u')' = (\cos x)'
		= - \sin x.}$
	</p>
	<p>There are several forms of notation for higher derivatives:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) \equiv D f \equiv \dfrac{df}{dx} \equiv \dfrac{d}{dx} f}$</p>
			<p>
				${f''(x) \equiv D^2 f \equiv \dfrac{d^2f}{dx^2} \equiv (\dfrac{d}{dx})^2
				f}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${f'''(x) \equiv D^3 f \equiv \dfrac{d^3f}{dx^3} \equiv
				(\dfrac{d}{dx})^3 f}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${f^{(n)}(x) \equiv D^n f \equiv \dfrac{d^nf}{dx^n} \equiv
				(\dfrac{d}{dx})^n f}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The symbols ${D}$ and ${\dfrac{d}{dx}}$ are operators we can apply to
		functions. Applying such operators, the derivative of the function is
		returned.
