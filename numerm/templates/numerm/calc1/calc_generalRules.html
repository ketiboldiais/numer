<h1>Derivative Formulas</h1>
<section id="intro_derivative_formulas">
	<p>
		We can think of derivative formulas as falling into two categories: (1) the
		specific, and (2) the general. A specific formula provides a way to
		differentiate a specific example. For example, ${f(x) = x^n}$ has the
		derivative ${f'(x) = nx^{n-1}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, general formulas are those that apply to all functions. For
		example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${(f + g)' = f' + g'}$</p>
			<p>${C \cdot u = C(u')}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the first formula above: The derivative of the sum of two functions is
		the sum of the derivatives of the two functions. And in the second: The
		derivative of a constant multiplied by a function is the constant multiplied
		by the derivative of the function. Both specific and general formulas are
		needed for polynomials.
	</p>

<section id="sum_rule">
	<h2>The Sum Rule</h2>
	<p>
		What is the derivative of ${f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2?}$ To compute this
		derivative, we must apply the
		<span class="term">sum rule for derivatives</span>. To do so, let's derive
		the general rule. The function ${f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2}$ can be written as the
		sum of two functions: Suppose ${g(x) = 3x^3}$ and ${j(x) = 2x^2.}$ Then
		${f(x) = g(x) + j(x).}$ That said, we apply the definition of a derivative:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we substitute ${f(x + h) = g(x + h) + j(x + h)}$ and ${f(x) = g(x) +
		j(x):}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{(f(x + h) + g(x + h)) - (f(x) +
				g(x))}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Rearranging:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} +
				\dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \right)}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>And applying the sum law for limits and the definition of a derivative:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} f'(x) &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left(
			\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0}\left(
			\dfrac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} \right) \\[1em] &= f'(x) + g'(x) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The above derivation yields the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Sum Rule for Derivatives.</span> Let ${f(x)}$ and
				${g(x)}$ be differentiable functions. Then the derivative of the sum of
				${f}$ and ${g}$ is the sum of the derivative of ${f}$ and the derivative

			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x) + g(x)) = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) +
						\dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x))}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Alternatively, given the differentiable functions ${r(x),}$ ${s(x),}$
				and ${t(x),}$ and ${r(x) = s(x) + t(x),}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${r'(x) = s'(x) + t'(x)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, returning to our original question, what is the derivative of ${f(x) =
		3x^3 + 2x^2,}$ the derivative is simply the derivative of each term:

	<figure class="math-display">

	<h2>The Difference Rule</h2>
	<p>
		Now let's consider the opposite of addition: What is the derivative of
		${p(x) = 2x^5 - x^3?}$ Here too we can think of ${p(x)}$ as consisting of
		two separate functions: Given ${q(x) = 2x^5}$ and ${r(x) = x^3,}$ ${p(x) =
		q(x) - r(x).}$ Again we apply the definition of a derivative:

			<p>${p'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{p(x + h) - p(x)}{h}}$</p>

<section id="constant_multiple_rule">
	<h2>Constant Multiple Rule</h2>
	<p>
		What is the derivative of ${f(x) = x^3 - x^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)?}$
		This may seem complex, but we know enough to handle this. To begin with, the
		term ${\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$ is just a constant. Thus, we can really write this
		function as: ${f(x) = C(g(x)),}$ where ${g(x) = x^3 - x^2}$ and ${C =
		\dfrac{\pi}{2}.}$ Let's come up with a rule for computing the derivative of
		${f(x) = C(g(x)).}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Because we can factor out constants from limits, applying the derivative
		definition is straightforward. First, the derivative of ${f'(x)}$ is the
		derivative ${(C(g(x)))'.}$ Thus:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} f'(x) = (C(g(x)))' &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{Cg(x
			+ h) - Cg(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= C \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x+h) -
			g(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= Cg'(x) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From our derivation above, we have the following rule:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Constant Multiple Rule.</span> Given the function
				${Cf(x),}$ where ${f(x)}$ is differentiable and ${C}$ is a constant:

		Thus, the derivative of ${f(x) = x^3 - x^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}$ is a
		simple application of the constant multiple rule, difference rule, and power
		rule:

<section id="product_rule">
	<h2>The Product Rule</h2>
	<p>
		It may be tempting to think that the derivative of a product is the product
		of the derivatives. This is wrong, and we've already seen why. Given the
		function ${f(x) = x^2,}$ the derivative of ${f}$ is ${f'(x) = 2x.}$ However,
		the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = x \cdot x.}$ If it
		were the case the derivative of a product is the product of the derivatives,
		then we would have ${\frac{d}{dx} (x^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(x) \cdot
		\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1.}$ Wrong. So what is the rule for products?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, let's apply the definition of a derivative. Suppose we have two
		functions, ${f(x)}$ and ${g(x),}$ both of which are differentiable. Now
		let's say that the function ${k(x)}$ is the product of these two functions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${k(x) = f(x)g(x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now apply the definition of a derivative to the function ${k(x):}$</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's apply the old trick of adding zero. We add and subtracting ${f(x)g(x +
		h)}$ in the numerator:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x + h) +
				f(x)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x)}{h}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Using the associative property, let's group the terms to break the quotient:
	</p>

	<div style="overflow: auto">
		<p>
			${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x +
			h)}{h} \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x)g(x + h) -
			f(x)g(x)}{h} \right)}$
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>Applying the associative property again:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${k'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \cdot
				g(x + h) \right) + \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \left( \dfrac{g(x + h) -
				g(x)}{h} \cdot f(x) \right) }$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, we know that ${g(x)}$ is differentiable (by assumption), so it follows
		that ${g(x)}$ is continuous. And since ${g(x)}$ is continuous,
		${\lim\limits_{h \to 0}g(x + h) = g(x).}$ Hence:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} k'(x) &= \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0}
			\dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}}_{f'(x)} \cdot
			\underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} g(x + h)}}_{g(x)} +
			\underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x + h) -
			g(x)}{h}}}_{g'(x)} \cdot \underbrace{\cancel{\lim\limits_{h \to 0}
			f(x)}}_{f(x)} \\ &= f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x) \end{aligned} $$

	<h2>Quotient Rule</h2>

		What is the derivative of ${t(x) = \dfrac{5x + 1}{3x - 4}?}$ For this, we

<section id="chain_rule">
	<h2>Chain Rule</h2>

	<p>
		In many of the previous examples, we
		<span class="italicsText">abstracted</span> the function's terms to arrive
		at a more general rule. For example, given the function ${f(x) = x^3 -
		(1/x),}$ we would write ${f(x) = t(x) - s(x),}$ where ${t(x) = x^3}$ and
		${s(x) = 1/x.}$ We would then arrive at a derivative from this more
		abstracted form. This technique results from two observations: First, every
		function can be expressed as the combination of smaller functions. Borrowing
		from computer science, we might call these smaller functions
		<span class="italicsText">helper functions</span>. For example, silly as it
		may be, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = g(x),}$ where
		${g(x) = x^2.}$ Or it can be written as ${f(x) = (g(x))^2}$, where ${g(x) =
		x.}$ Second, there are really only three ways to
		<span class="underlineText">combine</span> functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, we can <span class="italicsText">add</span> functions. For example,
		the function ${f(x) = \sin x + x^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = g(x) +
		h(x),}$ where ${g(x) = \sin x}$ and ${h(x) = x^2.}$ The ability to add
		functions implies the ability to subtract functions, since addition is
		really just the addition of a negative. For example, the function ${a(x) =
		x^3 - x^2}$ can be written as ${a(x) = b(x) + c(x),}$ where ${b(x) = x^3}$
		and ${c(x) = -x^2.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, we can <span class="italicsText">multiply</span> functions. The
		function ${\alpha(x) = (\sin x)(x^2)}$ can be written as ${\alpha(x) =
		\beta(x) \gamma(x),}$ where ${\beta(x) = \sin x}$ and ${\gamma(x) = x^2.}$
		The ability to multiply functions implies the ability to divide functions,
		since division is just multiplication with the reciprocal. The function
		${L(x) = \dfrac{\sin x}{x^5}}$ can be written as ${L(x) = M(x) \cdot N(x)}$
		where ${M(x) = \sin x}$ and ${N(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^5}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Third, we can <span class="italicsText">compose</span>, or
		<span class="italicsText">nest</span>, functions. For example, the function
		${f(x) = (x^2 - 1)^2}$ can be written as ${f(x) = (g(x))^2,}$ where ${g(x) =
		x^2 - 1.}$ Similarly, the function ${\kappa(x) = \sin (x^3)}$ can be written
		as ${\kappa(x) = \sin (\lambda(x)),}$ where ${\lambda(x) = x^3.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Borrowing again from computer science, these are the three
		<span class="italicsText">means of combination</span>. The remarkable aspect
		of functions is that every function can be written and rewritten, or
		expressed, with just these three means.
	</p>
	<p>
		So far, we've used our abstraction technique for the first two means:
		addition and multiplication. What we haven't used it for, however, is with
		composition. This limitation leads to some problems. We haven't yet seen a
		way to apply the technique to a function like ${s(a) = (a^2 - 1)^2.}$
		Fortunately, we can simply expand this function: ${s(a) = a^4 - 2a^2 + 1,}$
		then apply our familiar rules.
	</p>

		Expansion, however, begins falling apart once we have something like
		${(29a^4 - 17a^3 + 32a^2 - 17)^{15}.}$ This is a polynomial that would be
		messy to expand. We'd sooner exhaust ourselves before seeing the
		polynomial's final form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Worse, neither expansion nor our original method of generalization would
		help with functions like ${f(x) = \cos (x^2)}$ or ${t(x) = \tan
		\left(\dfrac{1}{2x^3 - x}\right).}$ With the rules we have thus far, it
		isn't exactly clear how we would compute the derivatives for these
		functions. All these functions are called
		<span class="term">composite functions</span> &mdash; functions combined
		through composition, or nesting. The most efficient way to compute their
		derivatives is with a new theorem: the <span class="term">chain rule</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To understand the chain rule, we must first review how composite functions
		work. Composite functions are simply compositions of functions. Our original
		method of generalization is applicable to composing functions. With the
		composite function ${y = (x^3 - 1)^{100},}$ we generalize ${x^3 - 1}$ to ${u
		= x^3 - 1.}$ Following this generalization, ${y = u^{100}.}$ Now, let's
		compute ${\dfrac{dy}{du}:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${y = u^{100}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{dy}{du} = 100u^{99}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		That was a straightforward application of the power rule. Now let's compute
		the derivative of ${\dfrac{du}{dx}:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${u = x^3 - 1}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{du}{dx} = u' = 3x^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>So now we have these two results:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="compare">
			<p>${\dfrac{dy}{du} = 100u^{99}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{du}{dx} = u' = 3x^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		But, what we ultimately want to find is ${\dfrac{dy}{dx}.}$ Now, notice the
		way Leibniz's notation looks:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="compare">
			<p>${\dfrac{dy}{du}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{du}{dx}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Those look an awful lot like fractions, and it's tempting to multiply them
		and cancel:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{dy}{\cancel{du}} \cdot \dfrac{\cancel{du}}{dx} =
				\dfrac{dy}{dx}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Chain Rule.</span> Suppose ${f}$ and ${g}$ are
				functions. For all ${x}$ in the domain of ${g}$ for which ${g}$ is
				differentiable at ${x}$ and ${f}$ is differentiable at ${g(x),}$ the
				derivative of the composite function ${h(x) = (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))}$

			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Alternatively, if ${y}$ is a function of ${u,}$ and ${u}$ is a function
				of ${x,}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{dy}{du} \cdot \dfrac{du}{dx}}$</p>
				</div>
