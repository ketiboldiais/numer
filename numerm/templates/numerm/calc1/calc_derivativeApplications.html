<h1>Applications of Derivatives</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>In this section, we examine some applications of derivatives.</p>

<section id="linear_approximations">
	<h2>Linear Approximations</h2>
	<p>The primary formula we use for linear approximations:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) \approx f(x_0) + [f'(x_0) \cdot (x - x_0)]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The formula above states that the value of some function ${f,}$ at a
		given input ${x}$ is approximately the sum of ${f(x_0)}$ and ${f'(x_0)
		\times (x - x_0),}$ where ${x_0}$ is a
		<span class="term">base point</span>. A level deeper, the formula
		provides that if we were given some curve ${f,}$ its value at ${x}$ is
		approximately the same as the value ${x}$ at its tangent line.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider ${f(x) = \ln x.}$ We know ${f'(x)=
		\dfrac{1}{x}.}$ Let's pick a base point, say, ${x_0 = 1.}$ We use ${1}$
		because it's a point where we immediately know the value for the
		natural logarithm &mdash; ${\ln 1 = 0.}$
	</p>
	<p>Where ${x_0 = 1,}$ we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<ul>
			<li>${f(1) = \ln 1 = 0}$</li>
			<li>${f'(1) = \dfrac{1}{1} = 1}$</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying the approximation formula to our facts:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \ln x &\approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0) \cdot (x - x_0) \\
			&\approx \ln 1 + 1 \cdot (x - 1) \\ &\approx 0 + x - 1 \\ &\approx x
			- 1 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\ln x \approx x - 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we plot ${f(x) = \ln x}$ and ${g(x) = x - 1,}$ we see the following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/linear_approximation_1.svg' %}"
			alt="linear approximation"
			loading="lazy"
			width="300px"
			height="300px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What the graph above tells us is that the value of ${\ln x}$ is roughly
		${x - 1.}$ The key word, however, is &#8220;roughly.&#8221; This is
		just an approximation. And with our plot, we can see that the
		approximation is good as long as we're somewhere near ${x = 1.}$ As we
		venture further and further from ${x = 1,}$ the less accurate the
		approximation is.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another way to interpret this approximation method is to refer to the
		definition of a derivative. Recall this definition:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x_0) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to x} \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta
				x}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Reading this expression from the other direction, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{\Delta f \to \Delta x} = f'(x_0)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This effectively states that the average rate of change, when ${\Delta
		x}$ is very near zero, is the derivative. This means that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} \approx f'(x_0)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, the average rate of change is approximately the
		infinitesimal rate of change. All together, the two formulas below are
		essentially the same:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol class="numd">
			<li>${f(x) \approx f(x_0) + [f'(x_0) \cdot (x - x_0)]}$</li>
			<br />
			<li>${\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} \approx f'(x_0)}$</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To see how, we manipulate the second formula. Multiplying ${\Delta x}$
		to both sides:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\Delta f \approx f'(x_0) \cdot \Delta x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Evaluating ${\Delta f}$ and ${\Delta x:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) - f(x_0) \approx f'(x_0) \cdot (x - x_0)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Adding ${f(x_0)}$ to both sides, we get the first formula:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) \approx f(x_0) + [f'(x_0) \cdot (x - x_0)]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, formulas (1) and (2) are simply two sides of the same coin, with
		each providing a unique way of interpreting approximations.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we work with linear approximations, we always want to have the
		base point ${x_0 = 0.}$ Why? Because it result in a more readable
		formula:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) \approx f(0) + f'(0)x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		That said, there are a few precautions to keep in mind with our
		formulas. The first formula,
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)[(x - x_0)]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>only works when ${x \approx x_0.}$ The second formula,</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) \approx f(x) + f'(x)x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		only works when ${x \approx 0.}$ With these rules in mind, let's
		consider a few key functions: ${y = \sin x,}$ ${y = \cos x,}$ and ${y =
		e^x.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		For ${y = \sin x,}$ we know that ${y' = \cos x.}$ Laying the values out
		in a table:
	</p>
	<div class="func">
		<ul>
			<li>${f(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f(0)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(0)}$</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>${\sin x}$</li>
			<li>${\cos x}$</li>
			<li>${\sin 0 = 0}$</li>
			<li>${\cos 0 = 1}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Applying our formula to our findings:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f(x) &\approx f(0) + f'(0)x \\ \sin x &\approx \sin
		0 + (\cos 0)x \\ \sin x &\approx 0 + x \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Hence, we can infer:</p>
	<figure>$$ \large \sin x \approx x ~~\mid~~ x \approx 0 $$</figure>
	<p>
		Next, the function ${y = \cos x.}$ We know that ${y' = - \sin x.}$ The
		table:
	</p>
	<div class="func">
		<ul>
			<li>${f(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f(0)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(0)}$</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>${\cos x}$</li>
			<li>${- \sin x}$</li>
			<li>${\cos 0 = 1}$</li>
			<li>${- \sin 0 = 0}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Thus, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f(x) &\approx f(0) + f'(0)x \\ \cos x &\approx \cos
		0 + (-\sin 0)x \\ \cos x &\approx 1 - 0 \\ \cos x &\approx 1
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we conclude:</p>
	<figure>$$ \large \cos x \approx 1 ~~\mid~~ x \approx 0 $$</figure>
	<p>The same analysis extends to ${f(x) = e^x.}$</p>
	<div class="func">
		<ul>
			<li>${f(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f(0)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(0)}$</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>${e^x}$</li>
			<li>${e^x}$</li>
			<li>${e^0 = 1}$</li>
			<li>${e^0 = 1}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Once more this yields:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\large e^x \approx 1 + x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's consider two more useful approximations. These the approximations
		for:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>${f(x) = \ln(1 + x)}$</li>
			<li>${f(x) = (1 + x)^r}$</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>Examining ${f(x) = \ln(1+x),}$ we have:</p>
	<div class="func">
		<ul>
			<li>${f(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f(0)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(0)}$</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>${\ln(1+x)}$</li>
			<li>${\dfrac{1}{1+x}}$</li>
			<li>${\ln 1 = 0}$</li>
			<li>${\dfrac{1}{1+x} = 1}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>And for ${f(x) = (1+x)^r,}$ we have:</p>
	<div class="func">
		<ul>
			<li>${f(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(x)}$</li>
			<li>${f(0)}$</li>
			<li>${f'(0)}$</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>${(1+x)^r}$</li>
			<li>${r(1+x)^{r-1}}$</li>
			<li>${(1+0)^r = 1}$</li>
			<li>${r(1+0)^{r-1} = r}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>Our analysis yields the following conclusions:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>${\large \ln(1+x) \approx x}$</li>
				<li>${\large (1+x)^r \approx 1 + rx}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Why are these approximations useful? Because they allow us to think
		about function outputs in a much simpler way. For example, what's the
		value of ${\ln(1.1)?}$ Most of us don't know off the top of our heads.
		But if we knew about linear approximation, we'd find that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\ln(1.1) = \ln(1 + 0.1) \approx \dfrac{1}{10}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here's another example:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Problem: Rational-natural-radicand.</span> Find
				a linear approximation near ${x=0}$ (${x \approx 0}$) of the
				function:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${\dfrac{e^{-3x}}{\sqrt{1+x}}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first step to this problem is to rewrite in such a way that we can
		apply our linear approximation formulas. In this case:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{e^{-3x}}{\sqrt{1+x}}=e^{-3x}(1+x)^{-1/2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying our formulas:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\red{e^{-3x}}\blue{(1+x)^{-1/2}} \approx
				\red{(1-3x)}\blue{\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{2}x\right)}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>If we carry out the multiplication:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${(1-3x) \left( 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}x\right) = 1 - 3x - \dfrac{1}{2}x +
				\dfrac{3}{2}x^2}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With the expanded expression, it turns out that we can throw out the
		${\dfrac{3}{2}x^2}$ term. Why? Because when we performed the original
		linear approximation, we threw out quite a few terms. In fact, the
		expanded expression above omits many other terms. Because we took that
		liberty in our original approximation, we can take that liberty again
		here:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} (1-3x) \left( 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}x\right) &= 1 - 3x -
			\dfrac{1}{2}x + \cancel{\dfrac{3}{2}x^2} \\[1em] &\approx 1 - 3x -
			\dfrac{1}{2}x \\[1em] &\approx 1 - \dfrac{7}{2}x \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Hence:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{e^{-3x}}{\sqrt{1+x}} \approx 1 - \dfrac{7}{2}x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		That's very cool. We've effectively come up with a way to reason about
		the original, nasty rational function through a much simpler
		interpretation.
	</p>

<section id="quadratic_approximations">
	<h2>Quadratic Approximations</h2>
	<p>
		When linear approximations are insufficient, we must turn to
		<b>quadratic approximations</b>. For example, in economics and finance,
		models often rely on logarithmic or quadratic scales to reduce
		complexity. Understanding these models requires reducing computations
		to quadratic approximations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quadratic approximations are just an extension of linear
		approximations. We're merely taking an extra step in detail. The
		general formula:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0) \cdot (x-x_0) +
				\dfrac{f''(x_0)}{2}(x-x_0)^2}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Where is that ${(&half;)f''(0)}$ factor coming from? Recall that a
		parabola is a quadratic. For the parabola's quadratic approximation to
		work, it must be itself:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = a + bx + cx^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Differentiating the function above:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) = b + 2cx}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Differentiating a second time:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f''(x) = 2c}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Next, we want to determine ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ by evaluating the
		formula at zero:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f(0) = a + b(0) + c(0)^2 = a \\ f'(0) = b + 2c(0) =
		b \\ f''(0) = 2c \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that the final approximation, ${f''(0)}$ is ${2c.}$ To recover
		${c}$ then, we must divide by ${2.}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f''(0) &= 2c \\[1em] \dfrac{f''(0)}{2} &= c
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		We now have our ${c}$ term: ${c = \dfrac{f''(0)}{2}.}$ This explains
		why we see the ${&half;}$ term in our quadratic approximation formula:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f(x) \approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0) \cdot (x - x_0) +
		\dfrac{f''(x_0)}{2}(x - x_0)^2 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that this really is just the linear approximation formula, with
		the additional term of a second derivative and a factor of ${2.}$ The
		linear part is the first portion, as we've seen, and the quadratic part
		is the second portion. Let's apply the formula above to the functin
		${f(x) = \ln(1+x).}$ Recall that the linear approximation for this
		function is ${\ln(1+x) \approx x.}$
	</p>
	<p>Following our formula, we begin by laying out the derivatives:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &f(x) = \ln(1+x) \\[1em] &f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{1+x}
		\\[1em] &f''(x) = -\dfrac{1}{(1+x)^2} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then, we evaluate the functions at ${0.}$</p>
	<figure>$$ f(0) = 0 \\ f'(0) = 1 \\ f''(0) = -1 $$</figure>
	<p>Applying our formula, we get:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln(1+x) &\approx 0 + 1 \cdot (x - 0) +
		\dfrac{-1}{2}(x - 0)^2 \\[1em] &\approx x - \dfrac{x^2}{2}
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we have the quadratic approximation</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\ln(1+x) \approx x - \dfrac{x^2}{2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Applying the formula above to ${\ln(1.1),}$ we have:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln(1.1) &= \ln \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{10}\right)
		\\[1em] &\approx \dfrac{1}{10} - \dfrac{1}{2}\left( \dfrac{1}{10}
		\right)^2 &\approx 0.095 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>

	<p>
		Recall that ${\ln(1.1) = 0.095310179804325.}$ With quadratic
		approximation, we gain a little more accuracy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, let's consider the quadratic approximation for ${f(x) =
		(1+x)^r.}$ Again we lay out the derivatives:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &f(x) = (1+x)^r \\ &f'(x) = r(1+x)^{r-1} \\ &f''(x)
		= r(r-1)(x+1)^{r-2} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Evaluating at ${x = 0,}$ we get:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &f(0) = (1+0) = 1 \\ &f'(0) = r(1+0)^{r-1} = r \\
		&f''(0) = r(r-1)(0+1)^{r-2} = r(r-1) \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Plugging in these findings to our quadratic approximation formula, we
		have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (1 + x)^r &\approx 1 + r(x-0) +
		\dfrac{r(r-1)}{2}(x-0)^2 \\[1em] (1 + x)^r &\approx 1 + rx +
		\dfrac{r(r-1)}{2}x^2 \\[1em] \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Hence, we have the quadratic approximation:</p>
	<figure>$$ (1 + x)^r \approx 1 + rx + \dfrac{r(r-1)}{2}x^2 $$</figure>
	<p>
		Let's examine the other functions we saw for linear approximation. To
		do so, we must gather all of the terms we need:
	</p>
	<table class="alg">

	</table>
	<p>
		Applying the information above, we have the following quadratic
		approximations:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \large \left. \begin{aligned} &\sin x \approx x \\[1em] &\cos x
			\approx 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}x^2 \\[1em] &e^x \approx 1 + x +
			\dfrac{1}{2}x^2 \end{aligned} ~\right\vert_{x \approx 0} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Recall that, where ${a_k = \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{k} \right)^2,}$ we
		have:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \lim\limits_{k \to \infty}a_k = e $$</figure>
	<p>We determined by first taking the logarithm of both sides:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln(a_k) &= k \cdot \ln \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{k}
		\right)^2 \\[1em] \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then, applying the limit:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln(a_k) &= \lim\limits_{k \to \infty} k \cdot \ln
		\left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{k} \right)^2 \\[1em] &= e \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can achieve the same result with quadratic approximation by first
		applying linear approximation. First, we know that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \ln(1 + x) \approx x ~\text{ where }~ x = \dfrac{1}{k} \approx 0 $$
	</figure>
	<p>It follows then that:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln a_k &= k \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{k} \right) \\[1em]
		&\approx k \cdot \dfrac{1}{k} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus we have:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \ln a_k &= k \cdot \ln \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{k}
		\right) \\[1em] & \approx k \cdot \dfrac{1}{k} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		The value ${k(1/k)}$ is easy to evaluate. It's just ${1.}$ This the
		linear approximation.
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \ln\left(\left(1 + \dfrac{1}{k}\right)^2\right) \approx 1 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Question: What is the rate of convergence for ${\ln a_k?}$ In other
		words, how fast does:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \ln a_k = k \cdot \ln(1 + \dfrac{1}{k}) $$</figure>
	<p>
		approach ${1?}$ Let's rephrase the question by rewriting the
		expression:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \ln a_k \to 1 \\[1em] \ln a_k - 1 \to 1 - 1 \\[1em] \underbrace{\ln
		a_k - 1}_{\text{How big is this?}} \to 0 $$
	</figure>
	<p>The answer lies in quadratic approximation.</p>
	<p>
		Again, all of the approximations above depend on the assumption that
		${x}$ is near ${0.}$ Summarizing our approximation formulas:

		Quadratic approximations can get very nasty. Accordingly, we should
		only resort to them if we truly aren't satisfied with a linear
		approximation. Consider the following problem:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Problem.</span> Find the the quadratic
				approximation for the function ${f(x) = e^{-3x}(1+x)^{-1/2}}$ where
				${x}$ is near ${0.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Carrying out the approximation with the approximation formulas above,
		we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} e^{-3x}(1+x)^{-1/2} &\approx \left(1 + (-3x) +
		\dfrac{(-3x)^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{2}x + \dfrac{1}{2}\left(-
		\dfrac{1}{2}\right)\left(- \dfrac{3}{2}\right)x^2\right)\\[1em] &
		\approx 1 - 3x - \dfrac{1}{2}x + \dfrac{3}{2}x^2 + \dfrac{9}{2}x^2 +
		\dfrac{3}{8}x^2 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we applied the approximation formulas in their entirety, we'd notice
		that there are some missing terms. These terms were dropped. Why?
		Because these higher order terms get so small that they're negligible.
		Simplifying the aproximation above, we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ e^{-3x}(1+x)^{-1/2} \approx 1 - \dfrac{7}{2}x + \dfrac{51}{8}x^2 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that the term ${1 - \dfrac{7}{2}x}$ is the linear approximation.
		The additional term, ${\dfrac{51}{8}x^2}$ is the additional term we
		obtain from quadratic approximation.

	<h2>Curve Sketching</h2>
	<p>
		The process of <b>curve sketching</b> is to illustrate the graph of
		some function ${f(x)}$ by using ${f'(x)}$ and ${f''(x),}$ whether ${x}$
		is positive or negative. To curve sketch, we state some key
		propositions up front:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If ${f' > 0,}$ then ${f}$ is increasing.</li>
		<li>If ${f' &lt; 0,}$ then ${f}$ is decreasing.</li>
		<li>If ${f'' > 0,}$ then ${f'}$ is increasing.</li>
		<li>If ${f'' &lt; 0,}$ then ${f'}$ is decreasing.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Put differently, if a function ${f}$ is increasing, then its
		derivative's tangent lines are positive (i.e., becoming less negative).
		If a function ${f}$ is decreasing, then its derivative's tangent lines
		are negative (becoming less positive). We can visualize the principles
		above with a rough sketch:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/concaveUp.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			height="150px"
			width="150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Examining the sketches above, we see that the tangent lines on ${f}$
		tend negative, corresponding to the graph of ${f'.}$ And with ${f',}$
		the tangent lines tend positive, corresponding to the graph of ${f''.}$
		With the graph of ${f'',}$ we see that the tangent lines tend negative,
		so a graph of ${f''',}$ the third derivative, would show a graph with a
		negative slope.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the case where ${f'' > 0,}$ or when ${f'}$ is increasing, we say
		that ${f}$ is <b>concave up</b>. And when ${f'' &lt; 0,}$ or when
		${f'}$ is decreasing, we say that ${f}$ is <b>concave down</b>. In the
		sketches above, ${f}$ is concave down. Thus, we have the following
		propositions:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If ${f'' &gt; 0,}$ then ${f}$ is <i>concave up</i>.</li>
		<li>If ${f'' &lt; 0,}$ then ${f}$ is <i>concave down</i>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>We will denote these two propositions with the following notation:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Notation.</span> Given a function ${f,}$ if
				${f^{\uparrow}}$ then ${f}$ is <i>concave up</i>. If
				${f^{\downarrow},}$ then ${f}$ is <i>concave down</i>. If
				${f^{\leftrightarrow},}$ then ${f}$ is neither concave up nor
				concave down.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's apply these principles by considering the function ${f(x) = 3x -
		x^3.}$ Differentiating this function, we have:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ f'(x) = 3 - 3x^2 $$</figure>
	<p>Factoring the derivative:</p>
	<figure>$$ f'(x) = 3(1 - x^2) = 3(1-x)(1+x) $$</figure>
	<p>
		We can draw several inferences from examining the derivative's
		equation. If ${x = 0,}$ then ${f'(x) = 3.}$ This is a positive number.
		More generally, the factor ${(1-x)(1+x)}$ is positive iff both
		${(1-x)}$ and ${(1+x)}$ are greater than ${0.}$ Based on this fact, we
		can express this as an interval:
	</p>
	<div class="split">
		$$ (1-x) > 0 \\ 1-x > 0 \\ 1 > x $$ $$ (1 + x) > 0 \\ 1 + x > 0 \\ x >
		-1 $$
	</div>
	<p>
		Hence, when ${-1 &lt; x &lt; 1,}$ then ${f'(x)}$ is positive. From the
		propositions we saw above, we infer that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ -1 < x < 1 \implies f'(x) > 0 \implies \text{$f$ is increasing} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		These aren't the only inferences we can draw. Looking back at the term
		${(1-x)(1+x),}$ we see that it's negative if either of the terms are
		negative. When is ${(1-x)}$ negative? Again we solve for ${x}$ as an
		inequality:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ (1 - x) < 0 \\ 1 - x < 0 \\ 1 < x $$</figure>
	<p>And ${(1+x) < 0}$ when:</p>
	<figure>$$ (1 + x) < 0 \\ 1 + x < 0 \\ x < -1 $$</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, when ${(x > 1) \lor (x < -1),}$ ${f'}$ is negative. Finally, we
		can determine when ${f'}$ is zero:
	</p>
	<div class="split">
		$$ (1 - x) = 0 \\ 1 - x = 0 \\ 1 = x $$ $$ (1 + x) = 0 \\ 1 + x = 0 \\
		x = -1 $$
	</div>
	<p>
		Hence, when ${(x = 1) \lor (x = -1),}$ then ${f'}$ is zero. We've
		gathered quite a few inferences just from the derivative:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${-1 < x < 1 \implies f' > 0 \implies}$ ${f}$ is increasing.</li>
		<li>${x > 1 \implies f' < 0 \implies}$ ${f}$ is decreasing.</li>
		<li>${x < -1 \implies f' < 0 \implies}$ ${f}$ is decreasing.</li>
		<li>${x = 1 \implies f' = 0 \implies}$ ${f}$ is constant.</li>
		<li>${x = -1 \implies f' = 0 \implies}$ ${f}$ is constant.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Based on this information, we can sketch the graph as follows:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_1.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice the yellow dots above. These points are called
		<b>turning points</b> or <b>inflection points</b>. They're simply
		points where the derivative (i.e., the <i>slope</i>) changes its sign.
		Formally:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> If ${f'(x_0) = 0,}$ then
				${x_0}$ is a <b>critical point</b>, and the number ${y = f(x_0)}$
				is called a <b>critical value</b>.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From the definition above, we see that the critical points are ${(-1,
		0)}$ and ${(1, 0).}$ If we substitue ${x = -1}$ and ${x = 1}$ to the
		original function, ${f(x) = 3x - x^3,}$ we get:
	</p>
	<div class="split">
		$$ \begin{aligned} f(-1) &= 3(-1) - (-1)^3 \\ &= -3 - (-1) \\ &= -3 + 1
		\\ &= -2 \end{aligned} $$ $$ \begin{aligned} f(1) &= 3(1) - (1)^3 \\ &=
		3 - (1) \\ &= 3 - 1 \\ &= 2 \end{aligned} $$
	</div>
	<p>Accordingly, we have the critical points:</p>
	<figure>$$ (-1, -2)\\(1, 2) $$</figure>
	<p>Plotting these points on a graph:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_2.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>Now, from our earlier sketch:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_1.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		we know that at the point ${x = -1,}$ we hit ${f' = 0.}$ Before that
		point (x < -1,) ${f}$ is decreasing, and after that point ${(x > -1,)}$
		${f}$ is increasing. We also know that at the point ${x = 1,}$ we hit
		${f' = 0,}$ but before that point (${x < 1}$) ${f}$ is increasing, and
		after that point, ${(x > 1),}$ ${f}$ is decreasing. Thus, we know that
		the graph along these points looks like:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_3.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We now continue filling in the gaps. First, it's always a good idea to
		step away from calculus for a moment and revisit the original function,
		applying techniques we learned from basic algebra and precalculus. The
		original function is ${f(x) = 3x - x^3.}$ This tells us that the
		function's graph has the property of crossing the point ${(0,0).}$ We
		confirm this by substituting ${x = 0:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f(0) &= 3(0) - (0)^3 \\ f(0) &= 0 - 0 \\ f(0) &= 0
		\end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>So, we place that point as well:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_4.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Based on these facts alone, we have a wide range of possibilities for
		what this function might look like:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_5.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The goal now is to just keep drawing inferences to narrow down the
		possibilities. Looking at the original function, ${f(x) = 3x - x^3,}$
		the function's equation consists of odd powers, so we know that this
		${f}$ is an <i>odd function</i>. And since ${f}$ is an odd function, we
		know that the graph of ${f}$ is symmetric. Everything that's done on
		the right is done on the left.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knowing this, the next step is to consider ${f}$'s
		<b>extremeties</b>.<sup></sup> By this we mean answering the following
		questions:
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			This consideration is something that we can't perform with graphing
			calculators. It's essentially asking,
			<q
				>What does the graph look like off the graphing calculator's
				screen?</q
			>
		</p>
	</div>
	<ol>
		<li>What happens when ${x \to \infty^{+}?}$</li>
		<li>What happens when ${x \to \infty^{-}?}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Let's consider the first question, when ${x}$ goes to positive
		infinity. When ${x}$ is a massive term, then the ${3x}$ term in ${3x -
		x^3}$ is negligible. This implies: When ${x}$ goes to positive
		infinity, then ${f(x) = 3x - x^3}$ behaves like ${f(x) = -x^3,}$ which
		goes to negative infinity. Symbolically:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} (3x - x^3) = \infty^{-}
		\\ \therefore~~~ & x \to \infty \implies f(x) = 3x - x^3 \sim f(x) =
		x^3 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Next, when ${x}$ goes to negative infinity, then the ${x^3}$ term
		becomes negligble, and ${f(x) = 3x - x^3}$ behaves like ${f(x) = 3x,}$
		which tends towards positive infinity.
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &\lim\limits_{x \to \infty^{-}} (3x - x^3) =
		\infty^{+} \\ \therefore~~~ & x \to \infty^{-} \implies f(x) = 3x - x^3
		\sim f(x) = 3x \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		This tells us that with ${f(x) = 3x - x^3,}$ the part of the graph
		before the first critical point is pointing up, and the part of the
		graph after the second critical point is pointing down:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_6.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At this point, our sketch is getting pretty accurate. All that's left
		to do is to <i>decorate</i>. In other words, add more detail. We can do
		so by considering the second derivative:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f''(x) &= (3 - 3x^2)' \\ &= -6x \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Examining the expression ${-6x,}$ we know that:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &x > 0 \implies f'' &lt; 0 \\ &x &lt; 0 \implies f''
		> 0 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>This tells us that:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} &x > 0 \implies f^{\darr} \\ &x &lt; 0 \implies
		f^{\uparrow} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		This tells us that where ${x &lt; 0}$, ${f}$ is concave down, and where
		${f > 0,}$ ${f}$ is concave up:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/curve_sketch_7.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		That's about as complete of a sketch as we can get. Here's the actual
		graph of ${f(x) = 3x - x^3:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/fullSketch.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		That was a pretty accurate sketch. Importantly, the point ${(0,0)}$ is
		where the graph changes from concave up to concave down. We know this
		because ${f''(0) = 0:}$
	</p>
	<figure>$$ f''(0) = -6(0) = 0 $$</figure>
	<p>
		Because of this special property, this point is called the
		<b>inflection point</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's consider another example. Let's say we want to sketch the graph
		of:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ f(x) = \dfrac{x + 1}{x + 2} $$</figure>
	<p>The derivative of ${f:}$</p>
	<figure>$$ f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{(x + 2)^2} $$</figure>
	<p>
		Looking at this derivative, we know that ${f'(x)}$ can never be ${0.}$
		In other words, ${f'(x) \neq 0.}$ This in turn means that there are
		only two cases for ${f':}$
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${f' > 0}$ or</li>
		<li>${f' &lt; 0.}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		This tells us that there are <em>no critical points</em>. Why? Because
		of the definition of a critical point: A critical point ${x_0}$ exists
		if, and only if, ${f'(x_0) = 0.}$ And since ${f'(x)}$ can never be
		${0,}$ there are no points such that ${f'(x_0) = 0.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever we encounter a situation like this &mdash; where we still
		don't have enough information after applying calculus &mdash; we want
		to go back to the basics; recall basic algebra and precalculus. Looking
		at the function:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ f(x) = \dfrac{x+1}{x+2} $$</figure>
	<p>We see that where ${x = -2,}$ ${f}$ is undefined:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} f(-2) &= \dfrac{(-2)+1}{(-2)+2} \\[1em] &=
		\dfrac{-1}{0} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>From this deduction, we have the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/rationalSketch.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		By plotting ${x = -2,}$ we effectively impose a border. The function
		${f}$ can never touch that line. The next step, is to answer the
		following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>What happens when ${f}$ gets very close to ${x = -2?}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To answer this question, we keep in mind that there are two
		possibilities for ${f}$ approaching ${x = -2:}$
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the right, and</li>
		<li>${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the left.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>When ${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the right, we write:</p>
	<figure>$$ \large f((-2)^{+}) $$</figure>
	<p>And when ${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the left, we write:</p>
	<figure>$$ \large f((-2)^{-}) $$</figure>
	<p>
		Examining the function, we have the following inferences. When ${f}$
		approaches ${x = -2}$ from the right, we get:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f((-2)^{+}) = \dfrac{(-2)^{+}+1}{(-2)^{+}+2} =
		\dfrac{(-1)^{+}}{(0)^{+}} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we write ${(-2)^{+},}$ we mean that it's not quite ${-2.}$
		Instead, it's just a little more than ${-2,}$ say ${-1.99999.}$
		Similarly, when we write ${(0)^+,}$ we mean that it's just tiny bit
		more than ${0.}$ We can think of it this way:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \dfrac{(-1.9999 \ldots) + 1}{(-1.9999 \ldots) + 2} = \dfrac{-0.9999
		\ldots}{0.000 \ldots 0001} = \dfrac{(-1)^{+}}{(0)^{+}} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, it's some number just a little more than ${-1,}$
		divided by some number that's just a little more than ${0.}$ This means
		we have a negative number divided by a very, very small positive
		number. This yields negative infinity:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \dfrac{(-1)^{+}}{(0)^{+}} = \infty^{-} $$</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, when ${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the right, it goes towards
		negative infinity.
	</p>
	<p>Next, when ${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the left, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f((-2)^{-}) = \dfrac{(-2)^{-}+1}{(-2)^{-}+2} =
		\dfrac{(-1)^{+}}{(0)^{+}} $$
	</figure>
	<p>which we can think of as:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \dfrac{(-2.000 \ldots 0001 \ldots) + 1}{(-2.000 \ldots 0001 \ldots)
		+ 2} = \dfrac{-1.000 \ldots 0001}{-0.000 \ldots 0001} =
		\dfrac{(-1)^{+}}{(0)^{-}} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here, we have a negative number divided by a very, very small negative
		number. This yields positive infinity:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ \dfrac{(-1)^{+}}{(0)^{+}} = \infty^{+} $$</figure>
	<p>
		All together, our analysis yielded several conclusions. When ${f}$
		approaches ${x = -2}$ from the right, it tends towards negative
		infinity. And when ${f}$ approaches ${x = -2}$ from the left, it tends
		towards positive infinity. Symbolically:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${x \to (-2)^{+} \implies f(x) \to \infty^{-}}$</li>
		<li>${x \to (-2)^{-} \implies f(x) \to \infty^{+}}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Because we have these inferences, we can next consider ${f}$'s
		extremities
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			What happens when ${x}$ is very large? (i.e., ${x \to \infty^{+}}$)
		</li>
		<li>
			What happens when ${x}$ is very small? (i.e., ${x \to \infty^{-}}$)
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For the first question, we evaluate the limit:</p>
	<figure>$$ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty^{+}} \dfrac{x+1}{x+2} $$</figure>
	<p>
		This limit is a little difficult to interpret as is, so we rewrite it
		by dividing the numerator and the denominator by ${x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty^{+}} \dfrac{1+ \dfrac{1}{x}}{1+
		\dfrac{2}{x}} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Looking at it this way, we can see that as ${x \to \infty^{+},}$
		${\dfrac{1}{x} \to 0}$ and ${\dfrac{2}{x} \to 0.}$ Thus:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty^{+}} \dfrac{1+ \dfrac{1}{x}}{1+
		\dfrac{2}{x}} = \dfrac{1 + 0}{1 + 0} = \dfrac{1}{1} = 1 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Just looking at the rewritten expression, the analysis doesn't change
		when ${x}$ tends to negative infinity. We still tend to ${1:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty^{-}} \dfrac{1+ \dfrac{1}{x}}{1+
		\dfrac{2}{x}} = \dfrac{1 + 0}{1 + 0} = \dfrac{1}{1} = 1 $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we have the following inferences:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${x \to \infty^{+} \implies f(x) \to 1.}$</li>
		<li>${x \to \infty^{-} \implies f(x) \to 1.}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>We can abstract both inferences above as:</p>
	<figure>$$ f(\infty^{\pm}) = 1 $$</figure>
	<p>So, putting all of our inferences together, we have:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Proposition 1: ${x \to (-2)^{+} \implies f(x) \to \infty^{-}}$</li>
		<li>Proposition 2: ${x \to (-2)^{-} \implies f(x) \to \infty^{+}}$</li>
		<li>Proposition 3: ${f(\infty^{\pm}) = 1}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		From these propositions, we know that there are two special asymptotes
		for the graph of ${f,}$ namely: ${x = -2}$ and ${y = 1.}$ On a graph:

	<figure>

			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Next, from proposition 1, we know that as we approach ${-2}$ from the
		right, we plunge towards negative infinity:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/rationalSketch2.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"

	</figure>
	<p>
		And from proposition ${2,}$ we know that as we approach ${-2}$ from the
		left, we fly towards positive infinity:
	</p>
	<figure>

			src="{% static 'images/rationalSketch3.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Finally, from proposition ${3,}$ we know that when for very small
		${x,}$ we're tending towards ${y = 1,}$ and for very large ${x,}$ we're
		also tending towards ${y = 1:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/rationalSketch4.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we have to consider the missing portions above. The key question
		is, does this graph ever dip into ${y = 1}$ and come back up? The
		answer is <em>no</em>. Why? Because there are no critical points. If
		${f}$ did dip below and come back up, we would have a critical point.
		But we know for a fact that there are not. Since ${f' \neq 0,}$ we know
		that we can never have a horizontal tangent line, which means that the
		the graph of ${f}$ can never dip down and come back up. As such, the
		graph of ${f}$ should look like:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/rationalSketch5.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="250px"
			width="250px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At this point, we're essentially done, but it's worth doing a few
		double-checks. To do so, we consider the derivatives. First, we rewrite
		the function's expression:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ f(x) = \dfrac{x+1}{x+2} = \dfrac{x+2-1}{x+2} = 1 - \dfrac{1}{(x+2)}
		$$
	</figure>
	<p>The first derivative is now easier to compute:</p>
	<figure>$$ f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{(x+2)^2} $$</figure>
	<p>
		Examining the first derivative, we easily see that ${f}$ is just a
		hyperbola, so we're correct in sketching a graph consisting of two
		arms. The first derivative also tells us that:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			${f}$ is increasing on the intervals: ${\infty^- &lt; x &lt; -2,}$
			and ${-2 &lt; x &lt; \infty^+}$
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		It's importat that we specify the interval, because it is
		<em>not</em> true ${f}$ is increasing. It's increasing only at a
		specific point &mdash; where ${x \neq -2.}$
	</p>
	<p>Next, we consider the second derivative:</p>
	<figure>$$ f''(x) = -\dfrac{2}{(x+2)^3}~~~~(x \neq -2) $$</figure>
	<p>
		Looking at the second derivative, we can draw the following inferences:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${-2 &lt; x &lt; +\infty \iff f''(x) &lt; 0}$ (concave down)</li>
		<li>${-\infty &lt; x &lt; -2 \iff f''(x) &gt; 0}$ (concave up)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The inferences above tell us that there's no <q>wiggle</q> in ${f}$'s
		graph. In other words, it rules out the possibility of one of the arms
		doing something like this:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/rationalSketch6.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			height="100px"
			width="100px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>And with that, we're done. Here's the actual graph of ${f:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/wiggle.svg' %}"
			alt="A curve sketch"
			loading="lazy"
			width="300px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Having gone through the examples, here's a general strategy for
		sketching:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Strategy</small>
		<ol>
			<li>Basic sketching:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Plot any discontinuities (especially infinite discontinuities).
				</li>
				<li>Plot the endpoints or where ${x \to \pm \infty.}$</li>
				<li>Plot any immediate points.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>First-derivative-informed sketching:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Solve for ${x,}$ where ${f'(x) = 0.}$</li>
				<li>Plot the resulting critical points and values, if any.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>
				Determine whether ${f' &lt; 0}$ or ${f' &gt; 0}$ on each interval
				between the critical points or discontinuities.
			</li>
			<li>Second-derivative-informed sketching:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Determine whether ${f'' &gt; 0}$ or ${f'' &lt; 0}$ (concave up or
					concave down).
				</li>
				<li>Solve for ${x,}$ where ${f''(x) = 0.}$</li>
				<li>Plot the resulting inflection points, if any.</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>Maxima &amp; Minima</h2>
	<p>
		Now that we have a good idea of how to perform curve sketching, we can
		now consider one of the most useful applications of differential
		calculus: Finding <i>maxima</i> and <i>minima</i>. In short, solving
		<i>max-min problems</i>, the most common forms of an
		<b>optimization problem</b>.
	</p>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			Suppose we have a wire of length ${1.}$ The wire is cut into two
			pieces, and each piece must enclose a square. What is the largest
			area that can be enclosed?
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		To solve this problem, we want to first draw a diagram of the wire:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/optimization1.svg' %}"
			alt="max min"
			loading="lazy"
			width="100px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Next, since we're trying to find the area, we want to express the area
		as a formula:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ A(x) = \left( \dfrac{x}{4} \right)^2 + \left( \dfrac{1-x}{4}
		\right)^2 $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Once we have this formula, the most intuitive and straightforward way
		to solve the problem is to find the critical points. In other words,
		solving for:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ A'(x) = 0 $$</figure>
	<p>Computing the derivative:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} A'(x) = \dfrac{x}{8} - \dfrac{1-x}{8} \\ &= \dfrac{x
		+ x - 1}{8} \\ &= \dfrac{2x - 1}{8} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Solving for ${x}$ where ${A'(x) = 0:}$</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{2x - 1}{8} &= 0 \\ 2x - 1 &= 0 \\ x &=
		\dfrac{1}{2} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Accordingly, we have the critical point ${x = 1/2.}$ The critical value
		then is:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} A(1/2) &= \left( \dfrac{1/2}{4} \right)^2 + \left(
		\dfrac{1-(1/2)}{4} \right)^2 \\[1em] &= \left( \dfrac{1}{8} \right)^2 +
		\left(\dfrac{1}{8}\right)^2 \\[1em] &= \dfrac{1}{64} + \dfrac{1}{64}
		\\[1em] &= \dfrac{2}{64} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{1}{32} \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>With a function's sketch, it's easy to find maxima and minima:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/max_min.svg' %}"
			alt="max min"
			loading="lazy"
			width="400px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The trouble is, sketching is a lot of work. We don't want to always
		have to sketch just to find a maximum and minimum &mdash; it's too time
		consuming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fortunately, there's a faster way to finding maxima and minima. We just
		need to examine a few facts about the function:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Criticial points,</li>
		<li>endpoints, and</li>
		<li>points of discontinuity</li>
	</ol>
	<p>To illustrate, consider the graph of the following function:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/min_max2.svg' %}"
			alt="max min"
			loading="lazy"
			width="500px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>There are five possible places the minimum or maximum might be:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${(0,0)}$</li>
		<li>${(e,e)}$</li>
		<li>${x \to +\infty}$</li>
		<li>${x \to -\infty}$</li>
		<li>${y \to -\infty}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Only one out of these five places is a critical point.</p>
