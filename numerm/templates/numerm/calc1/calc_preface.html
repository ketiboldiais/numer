		<span class="drop">T</span>he materials that follow explore single-variable
		calculus. Included in this volume are materials that would fall under a
		course called &#8220;Precalculus&#8221; and &#8220;Calculus I&#8221; in the
		American education system. We refrain from using this distinction for
		several reasons: (1) It denotes that there is some distinction between the
		materials covered when there is not. The materials covered in a
		&#8220;precalculus&#8221; course are the foundations for
		&#8220;calculus&#8221;, not separate. (2) With an online format, it is
		easier to keep things flowing; we do not have to deal with the constraints
		of physical publishing. This is all to say that we don't recognize
		&#8220;precalculus&#8221; as some distinct course or field that merits its
		own volume. It's the beginning of calculus, and it should be taken
		seriously.

		Calculus is an enormously important field. It is the study of smooth
		changes, or continuity. It is the base language of physics, and is employed
		in biology, chemistry, finance, some fields of computer science, and many,
		many more. The pervasiveness of calculus partly because a great many things
		in nature are <span class="italicsText">continuous</span>. Accordingly, the
		kingdom of calculus falls under the realm of
		<span class="term">continuous mathematics</span>.

		One way to distinguish between continuous mathematics and discrete
		mathematics (e.g., graph theory, combinatorics, set theory, discrete
		probability, etc.) is the difference between analog and digital watches. In
		an analog watch, there are infinitely many times between 1:00P.M. and
		1:01P.M. More generally, all along the analog watch's face, there are
		infinitely many times. In a digital watch, however, there is a discrete
		amount of time between 1:00P.M. and 1:01P.M. This is because a digital watch
		can only count up to a certain decimal place without causing error.

		The need to study calculus cannot be understated. The following materials
		conduct a rigorous investigation of ideas in calculus. To ensure we do so
		succinctly and efficiently, we assume the reader has taken a basic discrete
		and continuous mathematics course.
