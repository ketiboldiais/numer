		<span class="drop">T</span>he materials that follow explore single-variable
		calculus. In most American universities, the discussion that follows would
		fall under a basic Calculus I course. The materials on sequences and series
		(a Calculus II course) and multivariable calculus (a Calculus III course)
		are treated separately.

		Calculus is an enormously important field. It is the study of smooth
		changes, or continuity. It is the base language of physics, and is employed
		in biology, chemistry, finance, some fields of computer science, and many,
		many more. The pervasiveness of calculus partly because a great many things
		in nature are <span class="italicsText">continuous</span>. Accordingly, the
		kingdom of calculus falls under the realm of
		<span class="term">continuous mathematics</span>.

		One way to distinguish between continuous mathematics and discrete
		mathematics (e.g., graph theory, combinatorics, set theory, discrete
		probability, etc.) is the difference between analog and digital watches. In
		an analog watch, there are infinitely many times between 1:00P.M. and
		1:01P.M. More generally, all along the analog watch's face, there are
		infinitely many times. In a digital watch, however, there is a discrete
		amount of time between 1:00P.M. and 1:01P.M. This is because a digital watch
		can only count up to a certain decimal place without causing error.

		The need to study calculus cannot be understated. The following materials
		conduct a rigorous investigation of ideas in calculus. To ensure we do so
		succinctly and efficiently, we assume the reader has taken a basic discrete
		and continuous mathematics course.
