<h1>Differentiating Exponential & Logarithmic Functions</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">W</span>e now turn to differentiating exponential and
		logarithmic functions. Knowing how to compute the derivatives for these
		functions is especially useful in applied mathematics fields. For example,
		we frequently see exponential functions with future value calculations in
		finance, and logarithmic functions for discounting to present value. We also
		see exponential functions in population growth models. In all of these
		situations, knowing how to compute various rates of change is invaluabe. And
		as we've seen, that knowledge is provided through the derivative.
	</p>
	<p>
		We begin by recalling some of the basic rules of exponents. First, where
		${a, b > 0,}$ the following rules hold:

	<p>
		Keeping these rules in mind, let's see some functions. How about ${f(x) =
		2^x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/exponential1.svg' %}"

		/>
		<figcaption>
			The graph of ${f(x) = 2^x.}$ Notice how fast exponentials increase.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To find the derivative of this function, let's think about how Newton's
		quotient applies. It would look something like this:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{x + \Delta x}
				-a^x}{\Delta x}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What should we do next? Look at the term ${a^{x + \Delta x} -a^x.}$ We can
		rewrite this term as ${(a^{x})(a^{\Delta x}).}$ Incorporation this rewrite:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{(a^{x})(a^{\Delta x})-
				a^x}{\Delta x}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now we see a common factor we can factor out, ${a^x}$:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} f'(x) &= \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0}
			\dfrac{(a^{x})(a^{\Delta x})- a^x}{\Delta x} \\[1em] &=
			\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} (a^x) \left(\dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta
			x}\right) \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At this point, we have something to work with conceptually. Let's recall how
		the limit ${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0}}$ applies here. With this limit, we
		know that: (1) ${a}$ is fixed, and (2) ${x}$ is fixed. Because of these two
		facts, it follows that ${a^x}$ is constant. And because ${a^x}$ is constant,
		we can factor it out of the limit &mdash; it has no bearing on our analysis
		of the limit:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${f'(x) = a^x \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{\Delta x} -
				1}{\Delta x}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, our analysis is really focused on what the limit term is. Because of
		how important the term is, we'll write this expression as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f'(x) = a^x \cdot L(a) }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>where:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${L(a) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta
				x}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		So, what exactly is ${L(a)?}$ To begin, we state an observation. If we plug
		in the value ${x = 0,}$ we get:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} a^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = a^0 \cdot L(a) = 1
				\cdot L(a) = L(a)}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This observation tells us that at ${x = 0,}$ the slope of ${a^x}$ is this
		limit we're calling ${L(a).}$ More specifically, since ${a = 2,}$ we have a
		slope of ${L(2)}$ (at ${x = 0.}$) This tells us that if we instead had the
		function ${f(x) = 3^x,}$ at ${x = 0}$ we'd get ${L(3).}$ For ${f(x) =
		13^x,}$ at ${x = 0}$ we'd get ${L(13),}$ and so on. This leads to a broader
		observation: If we know the slope at ${x = 0}$ for some function ${f(x) =
		a^x,}$ we can determine the slope everywhere else. We've seen this
		phenomenon before with sines and cosines: We knew the slope for sine and
		cosine at ${x = 0,}$ and from the trigonometric formulas, we determined the
		slope everywhere else.
	</p>
	<p>
		The difference with exponentials: we're stuck right off the bat. With sine
		and cosine, we had the benefit of using radians, which allowed us to
		interpret the limits geometrically. Here, we're dealing directly with a
		number. There are no clever shortcuts to rely on. So we're going to need a
		different tactic. In this case, we're going to
		<span class="italicsText">beg the question</span>.<label

			>&#8220;Begging the question&#8221; is a type of informal fallacy.
			Essentially, smuggling the conclusion into our premises. For example: God
			must exist. How do you know? Because the Bible says so. Why should I
			believe the Bible? Because the Bible was written by God. Another example:
			The belief in God is universal. After all, everyone believes in God.
			Begging the question is <span class="underlineText">not</span> a logical
			fallacy. Arguments that beg the question are logically valid. These
			arguments, however, are typically unpersuasive (as seen in the preceding
			examples), but they are perfectly logical.</span
		>
		In other words, we're going to go at this problem in a roundabout way. This
		is a <span class="italicsText">circuitous</span> approach, not
		<span class="italicsText">circular</span>. Effectively, we're going to
		refuse to answer &#8220;What is ${L(a)?}$&#8221; directly for now, but we
		will eventually get to the question.
	</p>
	<p>We start by stating a proposition:</p>
	<figure>
		<p>
			There exists a base ${e,}$ where ${e}$ is a unique real number, such that
			${M(e) = 1.}$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>From the proposition above, we have the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is a very important deduction (so much so that we will encapsulate it
		in a formal definition later). Furthermore, from our previous analysis, we
		know that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${\left. \frac{d}{dx} e^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = 1 }$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As we're all too familiar with in mathematics, we should never take things
		for granted. Why does ${e}$ exist? How do we know it exists? So we know that
		${f(x) = 2^x}$ exists. That is, after all, what we started with.
		Furthermore, we know that it has the property ${f'(0) = L(2).}$ Now let's
		say we stretch the function ${f(x) = 2^x.}$ As we know
		<a href="{% url 'numerm:cont_graphsFunctions' %}">from our fundamentals</a>,
		we can stretch this function by multiplying its inputs with a factor ${k}$:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${f(kx) = 2^{kx}}$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		By the <span class="italicsText">exponent power rule</span>, the expression
		${2^{kx}}$ is the same as ${(2^k)^x.}$ And since ${2}$ and ${k}$ are both
		real numbers, ${2^k}$ is a real number, which we can denote as ${b = 2^x.}$
		This means we can rewrite the function above as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${f(kx) = b^x, \space \space \space (b = 2^k)}$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, what happens when we shrink a function's graph? Well, we essentially
		shrink the ${x}$-axis, which in turn leads to the graph's slope tilting up.
		Thus, as ${k \to \texttt{+}\infty}$ (${k}$ gets bigger and bigger), the
		slope of ${f(kx)}$ gets steeper and steeper. This is numerically confirmed
		by considering the derivative of ${f(kx):}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} b^x = \dfrac{d}{dx}f(kx) = k \cdot f'(kx)}$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>Evaluating at ${0:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<p>
			${\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} b^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = k \cdot f'(0) = k \cdot
			L(2) }$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At this point, we know that ${e}$ exists. When ${k = \dfrac{1}{L(2)},}$ we
		have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>
			${\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} b^x \right\vert_{x = 0} = k \cdot f'(0) =
			\dfrac{1}{L(2)} \cdot L(2) = 1}$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Substitute ${e}$ into ${b,}$ the equation holds true: ${e^0 = 1.}$ And since
		the equation holds true, we know that ${e}$ exists.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knowing that ${e}$ exists, we can continue with our derivative. We must now
		put all of these observations together. To do so, we rely on a particularly
		useful operation in mathematics: The natural logarithm. The natural log is
		defined as such:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule"><p>${y = e^x \iff \ln y = x}$</p></div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The natural logarithm has several useful properties that are worth
		revisiting:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${\ln (x_1 \cdot x_2) = \ln x_1 + \ln x_2}$</li>
		<li>${\ln 1 = 0}$</li>
		<li>${\ln e = 1}$</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		And just to reminder ourselves, the graphs of ${f(x) = e^x}$ and ${g(x) =
		\ln x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/euler1.svg' %}"
			alt="Graph of e^x and ln x"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
		<figcaption>
			The graphs of ${e^x}$ and ${\ln x.}$ Notice that the graph of ${e^x}$
			crosses at ${(0,1),}$ corresponding to the fact that ${e^0 = 1.}$
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With the graphs above, we can see that ${g(x) = \ln x}$ is indeed the
		inverse of ${f(x) = e^x.}$ We're switching the roles of ${x}$ and ${y.}$
		Notice further that ${g(x) = \ln x}$ is only defined when ${x > 0.}$ This
		corresponds to the fact that ${f(x) = e^x}$ is always positive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since ${g(x) = \ln x}$ is the inverse function of ${f(x) = \ln x,}$ we can
		use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of the natural
		logarithm. To do so, we'll write ${w = \ln x.}$ We want to find the
		derivative of ${w.}$ But we don't know how, so what we'll do is
		exponentiate:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${w = \ln x \implies e^w = x \implies e^{\ln x} = x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Given that ${w = e^{\ln x} = x,}$ we can differentiate:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{d}{dx} e^w &= \dfrac{d}{dx} x \\[1em] &= 1
			\end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying implicit differentiation, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{align*} \left( \dfrac{d}{dx} e^w \right)\left( \dfrac{dw}{dx}
			\right) &= 1\\[1em] \left( e^w \right)\left( \dfrac{dw}{dx} \right) &=
			1\\[1em] \dfrac{dw}{dx} &= \dfrac{1}{e^w} \end{align*} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Substitute ${w}$ with ${\ln x}$ (since we defined ${w = \ln x}$):</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{align*} \dfrac{dw}{dx} &= \dfrac{1}{e^{\ln x}} \\[1em] &=
			\dfrac{1}{x} \\ \end{align*} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Hence, we have the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln x = \dfrac{1}{x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We now have two formulas to work with:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>${(e^x)' = e^x}$</li>
				<li>${(\ln x)' = \dfrac{1}{x}}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We now return to our pesky function ${y = a^x.}$ If we can find the
		derivative for this function, we can find the derivative for any exponential
		function. Knowing the two formulas above, we can compute the derivative by
		first rewriting ${a^x}$ in terms of base ${e.}$ I.e., converting ${a^x}$
		into base ${e.}$ How do we convert ${a^x}$ to ${e^x?}$ We want to write
		${a^x}$ as ${e^{?}.}$ In other words, ${e}$ to some power:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${a^x = (e^{\ln a})^x = e^{x \ln a}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now we can carry out the differentiation:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx}a^x = \dfrac{d}{dx} e^{x \ln a}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first step is often a point of great confusion, so it's critical that we
		are comfortable with it as possible. First, we emphasize that ${e}$ and
		${\ln a}$ are constants. They're fixed. No movement. The only thing that's
		moving is ${x.}$ If we were asked to compute the derivative of ${e^{2x,}}$
		the derivative would look like:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(e^{2x})' = 2e^{2x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		by the chain rule. The same idea applies to the derivative of ${e^{x \ln
		a}.}$ Hence:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{d}{dx}a^x = \dfrac{d}{dx} e^{x \ln a} = (\ln a)e^{x \ln a}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We know that ${e^{x \ln a} = a^x,}$ so we have the derivative of ${a^x:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} a^x = (\ln a)a^x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we can go back to our very first problem: ${y = 2^x.}$ Recall we asked,
		what exactly is ${L(a)?}$ Well now have it:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${L(a) = \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{a^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta x}
				= \ln a}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} 2^x = (\ln 2)2^x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Similarly:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} 10^x = (\ln 10)10^x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is one of the reasons for why the natural logarithm takes as part of
		its name the adjective &#8220;natural.&#8221; No matter what base we choose,
		the respective exponential function's derivative will contain a natural
		logarithm. It's a logarithm that appears without any reference.
	</p>

<section id="logarithmic_differentiation">
	<h2>Logarithmic Differentiation</h2>
	<p>
		In the method above, we arrived at the derivative of ${y = a^x}$ by
		rewriting the base in terms of ${e.}$ There is, however, any way to compute
		the derivative: through the method of
		<span class="term">logarithmic differentiation</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		With logarithmic differentiation, rather than directly computing the
		derivative of some function ${u,}$ we instead attempt to compute the
		derivative of its logarithm. More explicitly, instead of computing:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} u}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>we instead compute:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln u}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying the chain rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln u = \left(\dfrac{d \ln u}{du}\right)
				\dfrac{du}{dx}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note that the expression ${\dfrac{d \ln u}{du}}$ just another way to write
		${\dfrac{d}{du} \ln u.}$ We know that this term evaluates to
		${\dfrac{1}{u},}$ so we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} \ln u = \dfrac{1}{u} \dfrac{du}{dx}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is the controlling principle of logarithmic differentiation. We state
		it explicitly:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${(\ln u)' = \dfrac{u'}{u}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying this to ${\dfrac{d}{dx} a^x:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\left. \dfrac{d}{dx}a^x \right\vert_{u = a^x} = \ln u = x \ln a}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		And as we know from our rules, ${(\ln u)' = \ln a.}$ Why? Because ${\ln a}$
		is just a constant. It doesn't move. Performing the rest of the computation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div><p>${\dfrac{u'}{u} = (\ln u)' = \ln a }$</p></div>
	</figure>
	<p>Solving for ${u':}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div><p>${u' = u \ln a }$</p></div>
	</figure>
	<p>Substituting ${u = a^x:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div><p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} a^x = (\ln a)a^x }$</p></div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We get the same derivative we saw with the rewriting-in-terms-of-${e}$
		method. Logarithmic differentiation allows us to compute even more complex
		derivatives. Consider the function:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${y = x^x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is a fairly nasty function. It's got both a moving base and a moving
		exponent. Once more, we apply logarithmic differentiation. First, we express
		${x^x}$ as a variable:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${v = x^x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Next, we rewrite the expression as a logarithm:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\ln v = x \ln x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Then we compute the derivative:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{align*} (\ln v)' &= \ln x + x \left( \dfrac{1}{x} \right)
			\\[1em] &= 1 + \ln x \end{align*} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we now have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{v'}{v} = 1 + \ln x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Solving for ${v':}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${v' = v(1 + \ln x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Substituting with ${v = x^x,}$ we have the following rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} x^x = x^x(1 + \ln x)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

		Having seen how the natural logarithm is so useful, we now turn to a closer
		look at the number ${e.}$ After all, this entire discussion has been
		premised on the existence of ${e,}$ and although we proved that it existed,
		we didn't delve any deeper. We do so now.

		Let's rewrite this expression in a more recognizable form. Suppose ${\Delta
		x = \dfrac{1}{n}.}$ This means that as ${n}$ tends to infinity (as our
		expression provies), ${\Delta x}$ tends to zero. Rewriting the expression:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n \right) = n \ln \left( 1
				+ \dfrac{1}{n} \right) = \dfrac{1}{\Delta x}\ln(1 + \Delta x)}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we perform the classic trick of subtracting ${0}$ from the expression.
		In this case, we will represent ${0}$ as ${\ln 1:}$
	</p>

	<div>
		<p>
			${\ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n \right) = n \ln \left( 1 +
			\dfrac{1}{n} \right) = \dfrac{1}{\Delta x}(\ln(1 + \Delta x) - \ln 1)}$
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		Do we see the pattern in the last expression? Let's rewrite it one more
		time:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{\ln(1 + \Delta x) - \ln 1}{\Delta x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is just an application of Newton's Quotient. It's the expression we get
		from computing:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} \ln x \right\vert_{x = 1}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>And we know the result of this computation:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\left. \dfrac{d}{dx} \ln x \right\vert_{x = 1} = \left. \dfrac{1}{x}
				\right\vert_{x = 1} = 1}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Finally, given ${x = 1,}$ the limit evaluates to ${1.}$ Now we just have to
		work backwards to determine our original limit, ${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}
		(1 + \frac{1}{n}).}$ First, we remind ourselves of the limit we just
		computed:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n}
				\right)^n \right) = 1}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is the limit of the natural logarithm of our original expression. To
		evaluate our original limit, we must &#8220;undo&#8221; the natural
		logarithm. And how do we do so? Be rewriting the natural logarithm in terms
		of its inverse: a power with the base ${e:}$
	</p>

	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\Large \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n =
				e^{^{\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n}
				\right)^n \right)}}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Note that this isn't anything new. We're just undoing what we've done. The
		limit of the log is equal to the log of the limit. And given that we've
		solved for the limit of the log, we see ${e}$ in all its glory:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				${\Large \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n =
				e^{^{\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \ln \left( \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n}
				\right)^n \right)}} = e^1 = e}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is such an important result, that we must state it from a different
		perspective:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				${e = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n} \right)^n}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As an aside, notice that reading the equation the other way leads to another
		key insight: An approximation of ${e.}$ In mathematics, we should always
		read our equations (and really, any proposition) both &#8220;forward&#8221;
		and &#8220;backward&#8221;. If we have equality, rewrite it from both
		directions. Inequality, state it in terms of what's less and what's greater.
		A conditional, state the contrapositive. Switching perspectives is the first
		step towards greater insight.

	<h2>Power Functions</h2>
	<p>Recall our rule for computing the derivative of a power function:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>${(x^n)' = n \cdot x^{n-1}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Our rule worked, but we restricted it to a particular condition: Where ${n
		\in \mathbb{Q}.}$ In other words, the power rule, as we originally
		formulated it, was limited to rational number powers. We couldn't use it to
		compute the derivatives of something like ${x^{\pi},}$ ${x^{\sqrt{2}}}$ or
		${x^{e}.}$ These are all
		<span class="italicsText">irrational</span> powers. Now that we know how to
		rewrite bases in terms of ${e}$ and logarithmic differentiation, we can
		extend the power rule to apply to
		<span class="underlineText">all</span> real numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		With what we know now, we have a few ways of computing the derivative of
		${f(x) = x^r,}$ where ${r \in \R.}$ One way is to rewrite the base in terms
		of ${e:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = x^r = (e^{\ln x})^r = e^{r \ln x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Using prime notation to express the derivative:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} x^r = (e^{r \ln x})'}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>we see that we can compute the derivative by applying the chain rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(e^{r \ln x})' = e^{r \ln x} (r \ln x)'}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Simplifying, the derivative of the exponential is just itself, so no change
		there. The derivative of ${r}$ is zero, since ${r}$ is a constant. And the
		derivative of ${\ln x}$ is ${1/x,}$ as we know.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} (e^{r \ln x})' &= e^{r \ln x} (r \ln x)' \\[1em] &=
			e^{r \ln x} \dfrac{r}{x} \\[1em] &= \dfrac{x^r r}{x} \\[1em] &= r \cdot
			x^{r - 1} \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We've now extended the power rule to all real numbers. We could've also done
		the same with logarithmic differentiation. First, we denote ${x^r}$ with the
		variable ${u:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u = x^r}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Taking the natural logarithm of ${u:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\ln u = r \ln x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Then, we differentiate:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} (\ln u)' &= (r \ln x) \\[2em] &= \dfrac{r}{x}
			\end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Next, we use the fact that ${\ln u}$ is the same as ${\dfrac{u'}{u}:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{u'}{u} = \dfrac{r}{x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Solving for ${u':}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>$$ u' = u \dfrac{r}{x}$$</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Then substituting ${u}$ with ${x^r:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} u' &= x^r \dfrac{r}{x} \\[2em] &= r x^{r - 1}
			\end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This confirms that the power rule extends to all real numbers. It also
		demonstrates that logarithmic differentiation and convering to base ${e}$
		are essentially the same methods. The biggest differences: With converting
		to base ${e,}$ we must deal with exponents, and with logarithmic
		differentiation, we often must introduce new symbols.
