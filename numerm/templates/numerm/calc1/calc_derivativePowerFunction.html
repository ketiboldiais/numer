<h1>Derivatives of Polynomials & Exponential Functions</h1>
<section id="preface">
	<p>
		Arguably, the simplest functions to consider the derivatives for are the
		following: (1) constant functions; (2) power functions; (3) polynomial
		functions; and (4) exponential functions. Exploring the derivatives for
		these functions provides clear applications of the preceding section's
		concepts, as well as several key insights to differentiation.

	<h2>Derivative of a Constant</h2>
	<p>
		Consider the function ${f(x) = C,}$ where ${C}$ is a constant. Applying the
		definition of a derivative:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} f'(x) &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) -
			f(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{c - c}{h} \\[1em] &=
			\lim\limits_{h \to 0} 0 \\[1em] &= 0 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Based on the analysis above, we have the following theorem:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem: Derivative of a Constant.</span> Given the
				constant function ${f(x) = C,}$
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">

					<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} (c) = 0}$</p>

	<h2>Derivative of ${x^n}$</h2>
	<p>
		Let's now consider the derivative of ${f(x) = x^n,}$ where ${n \in \Z^{+}.}$
		In other words, we want to compute:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} x^n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Consider the simplest case, where ${n = 1.}$ If ${n = 1,}$ then ${f(x) = x^n
		= x^1 = x.}$ The graph of ${f(x) = x}$ is a straight vertical line, which
		has a slope of ${1.}$ Thus, we have:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem: Derivative of ${f(x) = x.}$</span> Given
				the function ${f(x) = x,}$
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} (x) = 1}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		But about the more general case, ${x^n?}$ For this case, we return to our
		expression, ${\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{(x + \Delta x)^n - x^n}{\Delta x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that we wrote ${x}$ instead of ${x_0.}$ We did so because ${x_0}$
		isn't meaninful in this particular computation. ${x}$ can be any fixed value
		of ${x,}$ and we aren't so much concerned about what the value is. However,
		we state explicitly that ${x}$ is a fixed value, and ${\Delta x}$ is a
		moving value.
	</p>

	<p>
		To manipulate our expression, we must understand what the
		${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power of a sum is. To do so, we use a theorem
		from discrete mathematics, called the
		<span class="term">binomial theorem</span>. The expression ${(x + \Delta
		x)^n}$ is just ${(x+\Delta x)_1 \cdot (x+\Delta x)_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot
		(x+\Delta x)_n.}$ If we expand this multiplication, the first term in the
		product is ${x^n.}$ Next, we have a second term of the form ${x^{n-1}\Delta
		x.}$ How many times does this term occur? ${n}$ times, since we are
		multiplying ${(x + \Delta x)}$ by itself ${n}$ times. Thus, we have ${x^n +
		nx^{n - 1}\Delta x.}$ With just these terms, we have enough to continue
		computing the derivative, per the binomial theorem.
	</p>

	<p>According to the binomial theorem:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${(x + \Delta x)^n = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n} \dbinom{n}{k}x^{n -
				k}(\Delta x)^k}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		From this proposition, when ${k \geq 2,}$ we will always obtain terms
		containing ${\Delta x}$ in powers of 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Because of this
		implication, we can write the sum as:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(x + \Delta x)^n = x^n + nx^{n - 1}\Delta x + O((\Delta x)^2)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		That ${O(\Delta x)^2}$ encapsulates what we call "junk terms," at least in
		the context of continuous mathematics, and more specifically, in the context
		of ${\Delta x \mapsto 0}$. The ${O(\Delta x)^2}$ actually represents:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				$(\Delta x)^2 \sum\limits_{k = 2}^{n} \binom{n}{k}x^{n - k} = (\Delta
				x)^2 \left( \binom{n}{2}x^{n-2} + \binom{n}{3}x^{n-3} \Delta x + \ldots
				+ (\Delta x)^{n-2} \right)$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Importantly, as ${\Delta x \to 0,}$ we have the equation:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{o(\Delta x)}{\Delta x} = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Let's get back to our manipulation. With our application of the binomial
		theorem, we can rewrite our difference quotient as:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{1}{\Delta x}((x + \Delta x)^n -
				x^n)}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${\phantom{\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}} = \dfrac{1}{\Delta x}(x^n +
				nx^{n-1}\Delta x + O((\Delta x)^2) - x^n)}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${\phantom{\dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}} = nx^{n-1} + \dfrac{O((\Delta
				x)^2)}{\Delta x}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Now all we do is apply the limit (recall what we concluded from the binomial
		theorem earlier):
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} =
				\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \left(nx^{n-1} + \dfrac{O((\Delta
				x)^2)}{\Delta x}\right)}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${\phantom{\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}} =
				nx^{n-1} + 0}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${\phantom{\lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}} =
				nx^{n-1}}$
			</p>
			<p></p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Accordingly, we have the following theorem:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem: The Power Rule.</span> The derivative of
				${x^n}$ where ${n}$ is some positive integer (i.e., ${n \in \Z^{+},}$)
				is defined as:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\dfrac{d}{dx} (x^n) = nx^{n - 1}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The theorem above extends to polynomials. This means that we can now compute
		the derivatives of the power functions:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x}$</p>
			<p>${\frac{d}{dx} x^3 = 3x^2}$</p>
			<p>${\frac{d}{dx} x^4 = 4x^3}$</p>
			<p>${\frac{d}{dx} 2x^5 = (2)(5x^4) = 10x^4}$</p>
		</div>

	<h2>Constant Multiples</h2>
	<p>
		Consider the function ${f(x) = \dfrac{3x^6}{2}.}$ What is the derivative of
		this function? To begin, we can rewrite this function as: ${f(x) =
		\dfrac{3}{2} x^6.}$ Rewriting it this way, we see that ${\dfrac{3}{2}}$ is
		really just a constant. Accordingly, we can construct a more general form
		for this function: ${f(x) = C \cdot g(x),}$ where ${C = \dfrac{3}{2}}$ and
		${g(x) = x^6.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Thinking more generally, let's forget about the original problem and think
		about applying the derivative definition to a function of the form ${f(x) =
		C \cdot g(x).}$ We have:
	</p>

	<div>
		$$ \begin{align} f'(x) &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
		\\[1em] &= \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{C g(x + h) - C g(x)}{h} \\[1em] &=
		\lim\limits_{h \to 0} C \left[ \dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \right] \\[1em] &=
		C \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \\[1em] &= C g'(x)
		\end{align} $$
	</div>
	<p>The transition from line (3) to (4) follows from the limit law for multiplication. From the analysis above, we have the <span class="italicsText">Constant Multiple Rule</span>:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Theorem: Constant Multiple Rule.</span> Given the function ${f(x) = C \cdot g(x),}$ where ${C}$ is a constant and ${C \in \R,}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${f'(x) = C \cdot g'(x)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, the derivative of ${f(x) = \dfrac{3x^6}{2}}$ is ${f'(x) = \dfrac{3}{2} \cdot \dfrac{d}{dx} (x^6) = \dfrac{3}{2} \cdot (6x^5).}$ In other words, ${f'(x) = 9x^5.}$</p>
