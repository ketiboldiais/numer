		<span class="topic">Rationalizing Radical Denominators.</span> Rational
		expressions can contain radicals in the denominator. These can be cumbersome
		to handle, and it is almost always best to simplify them.
	</p>
	<p>
		To remove radicals from the denominators of rational expressions, we
		multiply the radical expression by the form of 1 that will eliminate the
		radical. If the denominator contains a single term, we multiply the rational
		expression by its reciprocal. I.e., if the rational-radical expression is
		${\dfrac{1}{b \sqrt{c}},}$ we multiply the expression by
		${\dfrac{\sqrt{c}}{\sqrt{c}}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, if the denominator of the rational-radical expression contains the sum
		of a rational and an irrational term, we multiply the numerator and the
		denominator by the <span class="term">conjugate</span> of the denominator
		&mdash; the expression wherein the sign of the radial portion of the
		denominator is made opposite. For example, if the denominator is ${a + b
		\sqrt{c},}$ then the conjuage is ${a - b \sqrt{c}.}$
