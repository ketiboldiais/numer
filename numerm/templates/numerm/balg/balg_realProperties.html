	<h3>The Nature of Mathematics</h3>
	<p>
		If we traced a mathematical field's development far enough down history, we
		would find its roots in human responses to external stimuli: Geometry and
		trigonometry grew out of land surveying and astronomy; algebra out of
		accounting; calculus out of describing the physical world. For some,
		development was driven by pressing problems. For others, pure curiosity.
		Regardless of motivation, we harnessed the ability to draw inferences from
		existing inferences. And it is precisely this ability that creates and
		enriches more complex mathematical fields &mdash; abstract algebra, number
		theory, algebraic geometry, topology, the list only grows.
	</p>
	<p>
		But why mathematics? A realist would say we do not know. However, to the
		poetic mathematician, it is arguably because mathematics is the most human
		response to solving problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we first encounter a problem, our first reaction is usually to describe
		it. For example, the Mesapotamians likely noticed that counting in their
		number system was difficult for large quantities of things. They may have
		then described the problem: Some numbers were so large that to express them
		required signaling the absence of a digit. The solution? Use a symbol to
		represent that absence (we now know this symbol as the number 0). Over time,
		as we studied the phenomenon of counting, and what 0 means and implies, we
		began noticing relationships to other ideas: ${x + 0 = x}$; ${0 \cdot x =
		0}$; ${x/0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		With enough relationships, we can create a
		<span class="boldText">mathematical model</span>. To do so, we first start
		with <span class="boldText">definitions</span> &mdash; statements explicitly
		assigning meanings to words or symbols. From those definitions, we produce
		<span class="boldText">axioms</span> &mdash; statements that we presume true
		without proof (axioms are also referred to as
		<span class="boldText">postulates</span>). In a sense, axioms are the
		<span class="italicsText">basic assumptions</span> from which we can draw
		conclusions, the very inferences that form relationships.
	</p>
	<p>
		These conclusions are drawn through the the powerful tools of logical
		deduction. The conclusions are formally called
		<span class="boldText">theorems</span> &mdash; statements that we
		<span class="underlineText">know</span> to be true from the axioms and
		definitions we started with.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is at the theorem juncture that we have the great divide of
		mathematicians. One camp stops at the juncture, and its members return to
		the very start of the process to find more theorems elsewhere. These
		explorers are generally referred to as
		<span class="italicsText">pure mathematicians</span>. Another camp takes an
		additional step &mdash; applying the theorems to nature. They take the
		theorems, and use it in their analysis of
		<span class="italicsText">data</span>, information from reality. These
		adventurers are generally referred to as
		<span class="italicsText">applied mathematicians</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		While being a member of either camp is often fertile ground for jest
		("applied mathematics is soft, pure mathematics is reality-detached"),
		restricting ourselves strictly to one or the other is naive. And in fact,
		most professional mathematicians will wade into the discoveries of the other
		camp, even if only in brief. The pure mathematician neglecting application
		may very well fail to see how her results conflict with the findings from
		the other camp; an observation that more often than not reveals errors in
		axioms and definitions, the very foundations of her theorems. The applied
		mathematician neglecting the work of pure mathematicians will end up
		misapplying theorems, or worse, attempting to prove theorems that have
		already been proven. In their toils, both waste the most valuable resource
		of all &mdash; human time.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this reason, the materials that follow explore both purity and
		application. We will always begin with grounding axioms and definitions,
		occassionally with an observation from nature for context. We then work our
		way up to theorems, and end with applications. Following this procedure, we
		begin by defining
		<span class="italicsText">mathematical language</span>. More specifically,
		we will begin with an area more "reality-detached" than pure mathematics
		itself &mdash; the field of philosophy called
		<span class="italicsText">logic</span>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="mathematical_definitions">
	<h4>Definitions in Mathematics</h4>
	<p>
		Philosophy has demonstrated time and time again that
		<span class="italicsText">language</span> grounds knowledge. And to
		comprehend language, we must know the meanings of the words we use &mdash;
		<span class="boldText">definitions</span>. There is, however, a dilemma.
		When we define words, we use other words, and in many instances, we find
		that our definitions are circular. "Dead" means lifeless, "lifeless" means
		deprived of life, and "life" means the quality separating an organism from
		<span class="italicsText">dead</span> bodies. Mathematics suffers the same
		problem: a "point" is the common part of two intersecting
		<span class="italicsText">lines</span>, a "line" is the figure traced by a
		<span class="italicsText">point</span> moving along the shortest path
		between two <span class="italicsText">points</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The solution: Take a smaller number of words and declare them
		<span class="boldText">undefined</span>. This way, we have words that we can
		use to build definitions, without ever running into the problem of
		circularity. This medicament is unusual, and it often mildly sickens emigres
		at first dose. It is, however, what separates philosophy and mathematics
		from many other fields. Fortunately, time will accustom ourselves to it. As
		we proceed, whenever we encounter a word taken as undefined, we will
		explicitly state that it is undefined.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever we construct definitions in mathematics, we must ensure that they
		meet the following criteria:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			the definition <span class="italicsText">describes</span> something we
			have in mind;
		</li>
		<li>
			the definition <span class="italicsText">includes</span> all of the cases
			we have in mind;
		</li>
		<li>
			the definition <span class="italicsText">excludes</span> all other cases;
		</li>
		<li>the definition is <span class="italicsText">meaningful</span>; and</li>
		<li>the definition is <span class="italicsText">consistent</span>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		For example, we could define a square as "a shape that exists in space."
		This definition fails the first criterion. It merely tells us that there is
		such a shape, but it gives us no indication of what that shape is. It does
		not <span class="italicsText">describe</span> what we have in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		We could define a rectangle as "a four-sided polygon whose vertex angles are
		right angles, and whose sides are equal." This definition would fail the
		second criterion, because it excludes non-square rectangles &mdash; it does
		not <span class="italicsText">include</span> all of the cases we have in
		mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may define a square as "a four-sided polygon with equal sides." This
		definition would fail the third criterion, because it would include
		rectangles and rhombuses, which are cases we did not have in mind. It does
		not <span class="italicsText">exclude</span> all other cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		We could easily define a square as "a line line line line point point point
		point." This definition, however, fails the fourth criterion. It is not
		<span class="italicsText">meaningful</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, we could easily define a square as "a four-sided polygon with
		five equal sides." This definition fails the fifth criterion. It is not
		<span class="italicsText">consistent</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A better definition would be define a square as "a four-sided polygon is a
		square <span class="italicsText">if</span>, and
		<span class="italicsText">only if</span>, its sides are all equal and its
		vertex angles are all right angles. The italicized words are logical
		operators, restricting what constitutes a square to two conditions: (1)
		"sides are all equal," and (2) "vertex angles all right angles." The "if"
		tells us that any case satisfying the two conditions is a square, and the
		"only if" tells us that any case failing any one of those two conditions, is
		not a square. This definition effectively meets all of the criteria: it is
		descriptive, it includes all of the cases we have in mind and excludes all
		others, it is meaninful, and it is consistent.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="mathematical_propositions">
	<h4>Propositions in Mathematics</h4>
	<p>
		Once we have defined words, we can begin to form
		<span class="italicsText">sentences</span> with those words. If we think
		about the sentences we use daily, we might observe that there are two kinds,
		or classes, of sentences: sentences that can be said to be true or false,
		and sentences that can not. For example, the sentences "Koror is the capital
		of Palau," and "Dogs are mammals," are sentences that can be given the value
		true or false, and in fact, it is true. However, the sentence "The weather
		is nice today," is not a sentence that can be given the value true or false
		&mdash; a hot summer's day is heaven to those of us who surf, but it may
		very well be hell to our friends nursing hangovers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sentences that can ascribed the value true or false are called
		<span class="boldText">propositions</span>. For example, the following
		statements are propositions in mathematics:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			"The sum of the measures of the interior angles of any plane square is
			equal to 360 degrees." (True).
		</li>
		<li>${12 + 5 = 11}$. (False).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following sentences are not propositions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Mathematics tastes sweet." (Nonsensical, formally).</li>
		<li>"A triangle consists of three lines and three points." (Vague).</li>
		<li>"It is sunny outside." (Requires us to qualify place).</li>
		<li>
			${x + 5 = 0}$. (Truth cannot cannot be determined until $x$ is given a
			value).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We state explicitly here that we've encountered some undefined terms, and
		they will remain undefined: <span class="italicsText">sentences</span>,
		<span class="italicsText">true</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>.
	</p>
	<p>From these undefined terms, we state our first axioms:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>There exists a class $C$ of sentences.</li>
		<li>
			A sentence is a member of $C$ if, and only if, it can be assigned the
			words <span class="italicsText">true</span> or
			<span class="italicsText">false</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The members of $C$ are called
			<span class="italicsText">propositions</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Propositions can be assigned one, and only one, of the words
			<span class="italicsText">true</span> or
			<span class="italicsText">false</span>.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>We will study what "class" and "members" are shortly.</p>
</section>

<section id="notation_propositions">
	<h5>Notation of Propositions</h5>
	<p>
		A common practice in mathematics, and many other fields, is to use notation.
		This is done as a matter of both efficiency and generalization. Accordingly,
		we represent propositions in mathematics with small letters, the most
		commonly used being $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, and $t$.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will also represent the values
		<span class="italicsText">true</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">false</span> with the capital letters T for true,
		and F for false. Both T and F are referred to as
		<span class="boldText">truth values</span>. Thus, when we analyze a
		proposition $p$, we can say "$p$ has a truth value of T," or "$p$ has a
		truth value of F."
	</p>
	<p>
		In some situations, we will also use the symbol
		<span class="italicsText">verum</span> for the truth value true: ${\top.}$
		And the symbol <span class="italicsText">falsum</span> for the truth value
		false: ${\bot.}$
	</p>
</section>

<section id="axioms">
	<h4>Axioms in Mathematics</h4>
	<p>
		One of chief tasks of mathematics &mdash; one might say
		<span class="italicsText">the</span> task of mathematics &mdash; is
		determining the truth values of propositions. This is done by (1) gathering
		the propositions whose truth values we have determined, then (2) using logic
		to derive, or evaluate, the truth values of other propositions.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, this can only be done if we have some propositions to begin with.
		Moreover, those propositions,
		<span class="italicsText">initial propositions</span>, must be true. The
		trouble is, we cannot evaluate the truth value of these initial propositions
		because they are <span class="italicsText">the</span> propositions that
		ignite the whole process.
	</p>
	<p>
		The solution: Assume the initial propositions to be true. Accordingly, let's
		make this clear with a definition. An
		<span class="boldText">axiom</span> is an initial proposition assumed to be
		true.
	</p>
	<p>Here is a famous axiom:</p>
	<blockquote>
		We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
		that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that
		among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness ...
	</blockquote>
</section>

<section id="the_number_system">
	<h3>The Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		Let's cover some rudimentary rules and definitions about numbers. We will
		often revisit these topics over and over again, as numbers cannot be avoided
		in mathematics.
	</p>

	<h4>Integers</h4>
	<p>
		The <span class="boldText">integers</span> are the whole numbers we use for
		counting, and their opposities:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots $</p>
		<figcaption>The integers</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The numbers greater than 0 are called the
		<span class="boldText">positive integers</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots $</p>
		<figcaption>The positive integers</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The numbers less than 0 are called the
		<span class="boldText">negative integers</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1$</p>
		<figcaption>The negative integers</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		<span class="boldText">The number 0 is neither negative nor positive</span>.
		It is both a <span class="boldText">nonpositive</span> and
		<span class="boldText">nonnegative</span> number. Thus, the
		<span class="italicsText">nonpositive integers</span> are the negative
		integers including 0:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0$</p>
		<figcaption>The nonpositive integers</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		and the <span class="italicsText">nonnegative integers</span> are the
		positive integers including 0:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$</p>
		<figcaption>The nonnegative integers</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h4>The Natural Numbers</h4>
	<p>
		In these notes, we define the <span class="term">natural numbers</span> as
		the positive integers including zero (i.e., the nonnegative integers):
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots}$</p>
		<figcaption>The natural numbers, ${\N}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Some texts define the natural numbers as the positive integers, and instead
		refer to the nonnegative integers as the
		<span class="term">whole numbers</span>. For reasons beyond the scope of the
		current discussion, defining the natural numbers as including zero has
		benefits for later sections.
	</p>

	<h4>Rational Numbers</h4>
	<p>
		When we divide one integer by another
		<span class="italicsText">nonzero</span> integer, we get a
		<span class="boldText">rational number</span>. More specifically, if, and
		only if, a number can be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an
		integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer, then the number is a rational number.
		For example, 4 is a rational number, since 4 can be written as
		$\frac{4}{1}$. 0.5 is a rational number, since it can be written as
		$\frac{1}{2}$.
	</p>

	<h4>Irrational Numbers</h4>
	<p>
		If a number cannot be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an
		integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer, then the number is an
		<span class="boldText">irrational number</span>. For example, the number
		$\pi$ is an irrational number, because it cannot be written in the form
		$\frac{a}{b}$.
	</p>

	<h4>Real Numbers</h4>
	<p>
		All of the numbers above are called
		<span class="boldText">real numbers</span>. In the simplest terms, a
		<span class="italicsText">real number</span> is a number that can be written
		as a decimal. Thus, 7 is a real number, since $7 = 7.0$. Similarly, while
		$pi$ is an irrational number, it is a
		<span class="italicsText">real number</span> since it can be written as a
		decimal ($3.14 \ldots$), albeit non-terminating.
	</p>

	<h4>Imaginary Numbers</h4>
	<p>
		Outside of the real numbers, we have the imaginary numbers. These are the
		numbers that result from operations such as $\sqrt{-1}$. These will be
		covered in more detail later on.
	</p>

	<h4>The Decimal System</h4>
	<p>
		Real numbers are written in
		<span class="boldText">decimal notation</span>. This is the prevailing
		standard (with the exception of <span class="boldText">binary</span>, which
		is favored by computers). The decimal system is useful because it allows us
		to quickly add numbers through the process of
		<span class="italicsText">carrying over</span>. For example:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/carryover.svg' %}"
			alt="carryover"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
		<figcaption>Carrying and borrowing</figcaption>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="arithmetic_intro">
	<h3>Arithmetic</h3>
	<p>
		The following materials discuss <span class="term">arithmetic</span>, the
		set of rules and conventions governing the manipulation of numbers.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="addition">
	<p>There are four basic arithmetic operators:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<th>Symbol</th>
				<th>Operation</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>$a + b$</td>
					<td>Addition</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a - b$</td>
					<td>Subtraction</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a \times b$</td>
					<td>Multiplication</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$\dfrac{a}{b}$</td>
					<td>Division</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a^b$</td>
					<td>Exponentiation</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<figcaption>Basic operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Above, we used the letters $a$ and $b$. These are called
		<span class="term">variables</span>. They are simply placeholders that we
		can plug numbers, other variables, or even other operations with variables
		into. Variables allow us to <span class="term">generalize</span>, or
		<span class="term">abstract</span>, statements. For example, ${2 + 2 = 4}$,
		and ${3 + 8 = 11}$. We make an abstraction of this pattern, or idea, by
		writing something like ${a + b = n.}$ This communicates the idea, &#8220;The
		number ${n}$ is the sum of ${a}$ and ${b.}$&#8221;
		<span class="marginnote"
			>There are many ways to read an equation, but they all express the same
			idea. The human mind, however, is a peculiar thing. Often, reading and
			writing the same equation in different ways can lead to drastically
			different insights. Consider all the different ways we can read ${a + b =
			n:}$ The sum of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${n.}$ The number ${n}$ is the sum of
			${a}$ and ${b.}$ The numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ such that the sum is ${n.}$
			The number ${b}$ is the difference of ${n}$ and ${a.}$</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Abstractions are useful because they allow us greater flexibility and
		accuracy with our statements. Suppose we want to say, "I'm looking for two
		numbers that add to 10." We can write: $a + b = 10$. This flexibility and
		accuracy is a powerful tool in mathematics, because it gives us plenty of
		room to write statements that say what we can and cannot do &mdash; rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Understanding the basic rules of arithmetic at a very high level is
		priceless in mathematics. Part of the elegance and power of mathematics is
		that we can arrive at beautiful, and often shocking, results from a set of
		very basic rules.
	</p>

	<h3>Addition</h3>
	<p>
		Addition can be thought of as moving to the right along the real number line
		by whatever number we are adding. So, for example, the expression $4 + 2$
		can be thought of as "Start at 4, and move 2 to the right." This give us the
		final destination of 6. Subtraction is really just addition, only instead of
		moving towards the right, we move towards the left. For example, $4 - 3$ is
		really $4 + (-3)$, returning 1. Visually:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/number_line_arithmetic.svg' %}"
			alt="number line"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<h4>Identity Property</h4>
	<p>
		When we add 0 to a number, we are effectively saying "no movement." Thus:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0 + a = a + 0 = a}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<h4>Commutative Law of Addition</h4>
	<p>The commutative law of addition states that:</p>
	<figure class="display-math">
		<div>
			<p>$a + b = b + a$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, the order of terms in addition does not change the sum of
		those terms. We call the property above more generally as
		<span class="term">commutativity.</span> One way to remember it is &#8220;In
		addition, terms can <span class="italicsText">commute</span>.&#8221; In
		other words, the terms can move around as they please, as long as they stay
		within addition (and as we'll see later, multiplication).
	</p>

	<h4>Associative Law of Addition</h4>
	<p>
		The associative law of addition states that the sum of the terms does not
		depend on the order of operations. In other words, we can group terms
		freely:
	</p>
	<figure class="display-math">
		<div>
			<p>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The idea is made apparent from a simple analogy. If we want sweet iced tea,
		we can: add the tea, then the ice, then the sugar; or we can add the sugar,
		then the ice, then the tea; or we can add the tea, then the sugar, then the
		ice, and so on and so forth. Either or, the result is the same &mdash; sweet
		iced tea.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>Granted, greater minds may differ on how sweet iced tea should be
			made.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		We call the property above more generally as
		<span class="term">associativity</span>. We can remember it as, &#8220;In
		addition, the terms are free to
		<span class="italicsText">associate</span>.&#8221; In other words, the terms
		can gather together or separate as they please, as long as they stay within
		addition (and again, as we'll see later, multiplication).
	</p>

	<p>The associative law of addition leads to another useful property:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>If $a + b = 0$, then $b = -a$ and $a = -b$.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The above property is the direct result of subtracting either $a$ or $b$
		from both sides. Associativity and commutativity are what allow us to
		rewrite expressions in numerous different ways:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$(a - b) + c = (a + (-b)) + c$</p>
			<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (-b + c)$ by associativity</p>
			<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (c - b)$ by commutativity</p>
			<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = (a + c) - b$ by associativity</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<h4>Subtraction</h4>
	<p>
		As aforementioned, subtraction is really just adding negative numbers.
		Considering the addition with zero rule, we have the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$a + (-a) = 0$</p>
			<p>$-a + a = 0$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Given the equation $a + (-a) = 0$, we say that $-a$ is the
		<span class="boldText">additive inverse</span> of $a$.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever we see the equation $-a + a = 0$, we should immediately become
		aware that we $a$ and $-a$ are on opposite sides of 0 on the real line.
		Furthermore, because $-a + a = 0$, subtracting $-a$ from both sides, we have
		$-a = -(-a)$.
	</p>

	<h4>Even-Odd Signage Rule</h4>
	<p>Given that $a + (-a) = 0$, we can draw yet another inference:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$a = -(-a)$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that the number of minus signs is even. If we add another minus sign:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$-(-(-a)) = -(a) = -a$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we can make yet another inference:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				Let $a$ be a positive real number, and $x$ be $a$ preceded by $n$ minus
				signs, where $n$ is an integer. If $n$ is even, then $x$ is positive

		The multiplication algorithm allows us to compute large numbers without the

	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{array}{cc} & \space & 1 & 7 & \\ & \times & 3 & 8 & \\ \hline & 1

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ 1a = a }$</p>

	</figure>
	<p>The above rules allow us to perform elaborate simplifications:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ (2a)(5b) = 2(a(5b)) }$ by associativity</p>

		<span class="exh">Exercise</span>. Numbers consisting entirely of the digit
		"8" are added, resulting in the sum 1000. What are these numbers?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>First, assume the following:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots \\ + \space
			\ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000 \end{alignedat} \end{matrix} $$
		</figure>
		<p>What we know:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Each number ends with an 8.</li>
			<li>Since the sum is 1000, the sum of the last digit, an 8, is 0.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			How many 8s do we need to arrive at a sum where the last digit is 0? At
			least five 8s, since $8 \times 5 = 40$. Thus, we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\
			\ldots 8 \\ + \space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000 \end{alignedat} \end{matrix}
			$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Now note that there is a 4 that must be carried to the next place. To keep
			the sum's digits 0, we need a sum of 8s and a 4 that returns the last
			digit 0. We know that $8 + 8 + 4 = 20$. Further, we need one more 8 to get
			a 10:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} 8 \\ 8 \\ 8 \\ 88 \\ + \space 888

			To start, we are looking for a number where $A + B = nC$, where $n$ and

	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			First, $715 \times 1001 = 715715$. We can see this with the multiplication
			algorithm:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{cc} & & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \times & & & & 7 & 1 & 5 \\

			\hline & 7 & 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 & 5 \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Under the multiplication algorithm, Daniel simply takes the three digits,
			ABC, and performs the following:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>$C00C$</li>
			<li>$B00B$</li>
			<li>$A00A$</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Then, he adds the numbers, shifting one place to the left on each line:

			& 0 & A \\ \hline & A & B & C & A & B & C \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			The result then is $ABCABC$, a repetition of the digits $ABC$. Note
			further that there are two 0s, and the digits are repeated twice.

	<h4>Distributivity</h4>
	<p>
		With the rules thus far, we can make even further inferences. We know that,
		if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then ${ a = -b }$ and ${ b = -a }$. Thus, if ${ a + b =
		0 }$, then it must be true that ${ (a + b) + (-a - b) = 0 }$, since ${ a + b
		= 0 }$ and ${ -a - b = 0 }$. If ${ (a + b) + (-a-b) = 0 }$, then it follows
		that ${ a + b - a -b = 0 }$. Rearranging the equation, we have ${ a - a + b
		- b = 0 }$. Rearranging again, we have: ${ -(a + b) = -a + (-b) }$. This
		yields the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ -(a + b) = -a - b }$.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We know this rule as the
		<span class="boldText">distributive law</span>. Note that we should always
		be vigilant about distributing a minus sign to a sum involving negative
		numbers: ${ -(-a) = a }$. To ensure that vigilance, we should make the
		following rules clear:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are positive integers, then ${ a + b }$ is a
				positive integer.
			</p>
			<p>
				If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are negative integers, then ${ a + b }$ is a
				negative integer.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can see that these rules are true with a simple proof. Let ${ a = -n }$
		and ${ b = -m }$, where ${ m }$ and ${ n }$ are positive. It follows then
		that ${ a + b = -n - m = -(n + m) }$. Since ${ n }$ and ${ m }$ are
		positive, ${ n + m }$ is positive. Since ${ n + m }$ is positive, it follows
		that ${ a + b }$ is negative, because ${ n + m }$ is positive only if ${ a +
		b }$ is negative.

<section id="closure">
	<h2>Closure</h2>
	<p>
		Even without a sophisticated understanding of number theory, we know that
		adding a whole number to a whole number always returns a whole number. E.g.,
		${1 + 1 = 2,}$ ${2 + 5 = 7,}$ ${1132+ 324 = 1456.}$ Formally, we call this

		From the property above, we say that the natural numbers are

		In other words, if we add two natural numbers, then the sum is a natural
		number. If we multiply two natural numbers, then the product is natural
		number.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the property above, we can draw a few other useful properties. First,
		because we define the natural numbers as including 0, the set of natural
		numbers is a superset of the positive integers. Accordingly:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">

		In other words, the set of positive integers is closed under addition and
		multiplication. If we add two positive integers, then the sum is a positive
		integer. If we multiply two positive integers, then the product is a
		positive integer.
	</p>

		Note that the natural numbers' closure property applies only to addition and

<section id="division">
	<h2>Division & Divisibility</h2>
	<p>
		Of the core arithmetic operators, division is the most complex. In any

	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

		Notice that both the even integers and the odd integers increment by 2. The
		difference, however, is that the even integers start at 2, and the odd
		integers start at 1. A number's property of odd-ness or even-ness is called
		the number's <span class="term">parity</span>. Note that parity is a
		property held only by the positive integers. The negative integers and 0 are
		neither even nor odd. We can abstract this idea with algebra: An even
		integer is an integer that can be written as ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a
		positive integer. Denoting the set of even integers with the symbol
		${\Z_{\text{even}},}$ and the set of positive integers with the symbol
		${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ we can define an even integer more formally as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${x \in \Z.}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \in \Z_{\text{even}} \iff x = 2k : k \in \Z^{+}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is even if, and only if, it can be written in the
				form ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>For the odd integers, we write:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${x \in \Z.}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k - 1 : k \in \Z^{+}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the
				form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Alternatively, we can define odd integers as the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${x \in \Z.}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k + 1 : k \in \N}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the
				form ${2k + 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a natural number.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The only meaningful difference between the first and second definition is
		whether ${k}$ is a natural number or a positive integer. In other words,
		whether ${k}$ can be 0. If ${k}$ can be 0, then we must change the
		definition from ${2k - 1}$ to ${2k + 1,}$ because if ${k = 0,}$ then ${2k -
		1 = -1.}$ ${-1}$ is neither odd nor even, because parity is a property that
		applies only to positive integers (0 is also neither odd nor even).

	<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Prove the theorem above.</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proof (by direct proof).</span> Given ${a \in
			\Z^{+},}$ there are two hypotheses to be proved:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

				<p>If ${a}$ is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd.</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We prove each hypothesis in turn, beginning with the first hypothesis.
			Suppose ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$ Since ${a}$ is an even integer, then
			by definition, ${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n,}$ where ${n}$
			is a positive integer. By substitution:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n)^2}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the definition of an exponent:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n)(2n)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the associative property of multiplication:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		</figure>
		<p>By the definition of an exponent:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2)(2n^2)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because the product of positive integer is a positive integer, the intger
			${2n^2}$ is a positive integer. Hence:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2m}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${m}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2m}$ is an even integer by
			definition, ${a^2}$ is even.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, we consider the second hypothesis. Suppose ${a \in
			\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ Given that ${a}$ is an odd integer, then by definition,
			${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n + 1,}$ where ${n}$ is a
			positive integer. By substitution:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n + 1)^2}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By expansion:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		</figure>
		<p>By associativity:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because ${n}$ is a positive integer, ${2n^2 + 2n}$ is a positive integer.
			Hence:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2k + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2k + 1}$ is an odd integer by
			definition, ${a^2}$ is odd.

	<p>The theorem above yields a corollary:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Corollary.</span> Let ${a \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$</p>
					<p>${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		As with many corollaries, the propositions above are implied by the previous
		theorem. If ${a^2}$ is even, then ${a}$ must be even, for if ${a}$ is odd,
		then ${a^2}$ is odd. Similarly, if ${a^2}$ is odd, then ${a}$ must be odd,
		for if ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even. This is a straightforward
		example of logical contradiction.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is from parity that we generalize the concept of
		<span class="term">divisibility</span>. Suppose ${a}$ is a positive integer
		and ${b}$ is an integer. When we say that ${b}$ is divisible by ${a,}$ we
		mean that ${a}$ divides ${b.}$ We denote this proposition with the notation
		${a \space\vert\space b.}$ An integer ${b}$ is divisible by ${a}$ if, and
		only if, ${b = an,}$ where ${n}$ is some integer.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${a \in \Z^{+}}$ and ${b \in
				\Z.}$ Then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a \space\vert\space b \iff b = an}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>where ${n \in \Z.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The definition above yields several useful propositions:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>Every integer is divisible by 1.</li>
			<li>Every positive integer is divisible by itself.</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first proposition is implied by the fact that every integer can be
		written as ${n = (1)(n).}$ This in turn implies the second proposition.
	</p>

	<h3>Composites & Primes</h3>
	<figure style="margin: 5% 0">
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/compound_prime.svg' %}"
			alt="compound numbers, prime numbers"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From the definition above, there are two subsets within the natural numbers.
		Any natural number that can be grouped into a solid rectangle is called a
		<span class="term">composite number</span> (also called
		<span class="italicsText">compound numbers</span>). More formally:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">composite number</span> ${k}$ is a natural
				number greater than 1, divisible by some positive integer ${n,}$ where
				${n \neq 1.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The negation of this definition yields the
		<span class="term">prime numbers</span>, numbers that
		<span class="underlineText">cannot</span> be grouped into a solid rectangle.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">prime number</span> ${m}$ is a natural number
				greater than 1, divisible only by 1 and itself.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note that from the definitions above, we see that the numbers 0 and 1 have a
		special property: Both 0 and 1 are neither prime nor compound.
	</p>

	<h3>Division & Rational Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		The operation of division is closely tied to the
		<span class="term">rational numbers</span>. A rational number is any number
		that can be written in the form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ or ${m/n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers, and ${n \neq 0.}$ The last condition is
		crucial, because in this particular world (classical algebra),
		<span class="underlineText">we cannot divide by 0.</span> The rational
		numbers come in various forms:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\ldots, \dfrac{1}{3}, - \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{2}{3}, 1.4, 0.08, 12.0,
				0.0, \ldots}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The rule is, as long as a number can be written as ${m/n,}$ where ${m, n}$
		are integers and ${n \neq 0,}$ then the number is rational number.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>In computer science, the rational numbers are called
			<span class="term">floats</span> or
			<span class="term">floating point numbers</span> (the decimal point
			&#8220;floats&#8221; as needed).</span
		>
		Otherwise, the number is an irrational number. Note what this definition
		means. Every integer satisfies the definition rational number definition, so
		we say that the rational numbers are a proper superset of the integers.
		I.e., every integer is a rational number, but not every rational number is
		an integer.

	<h3>The Division Algorithm</h3>
	<p>Among the operations, division is the most complicated.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise</span>. A six-digit number having 1 as its
		leftmost digit becomes three times bigger if we take this digit off and put
		it at the end of the number. What is this number?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>Let the number be $1ABCDE$.</p>
		<p>Then, $ABCDE1 = 3 \times 1ABCDE$.</p>
		<p>Rewrite this with the multiplication algorithm:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{cc} & A & B & C & D & E \\ \times & & & & & 3 \\ \hline A
			& B & C & D & E & 1 \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Let's focus on $E$. We need a digit $E$ where $3 \times E = n1$, where $n$
			is a digit. This digit must be 7, for $7 \times 3 = 21$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that $E$ is 7, so what might $D$ be? Well, we need a digit $D$
			where $(D \times 3) + 2 = 7$. Or, rearranging, $D \times 3 = 5$. The only
			digit that would satisfy this condition is $D = 5$ (since $3 \times 5 + 2
			= 17$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that $D$ is 5, so now we look at $C$. We need a digit $C$ such
			that $(C \times 3) + 1 = 5$, or, rearranging, $C \times 3 = 4$. There is
			only one digit that satisfies this condition, 8. Thus, $C = 8$.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we look at $B$. What digit satisfies the condition $B \times 3 = 6$?
			It must be 2. Therefore, $B = 2$.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we look at $A$. What digit results in $A \times 3 = 12$. It must
			be 4, since $3 \times 4 = 12$. Hence, the digits are $A = 4$, $B = 2$, $C
			= 8$, and $D = 5$.

<section id="order_of_operations">
	<h3>Order of Operations</h3>
	<p>
		Arithmetic allows us to combine numbers, through the operations listed
		above, to form other numbers. The way we order operations matters in
		mathematics. Otherwise, we run into problems. For example, consider the
		following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$2 + 3 \times 4$</p>
		<figcaption>Multiple operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What does this expression mean? Well, it could be: (1) Add 2 and 3, then (2)
		multiply the sum by 4. Or, it could mean: (1) Multiply 3 and 4, and (2) add
		2 to the product. This ambiguity is unacceptable in mathematics. We need be
		clear and precise with our words. For these reason, mathematics follows a
		few conventions on how to write mathematical expressions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Evaluate expressions in parentheses first, working from the inner most
				to the outer most, applying all of these rules.
			</li>
			<li>Perform all exponentiations.</li>
			<li>Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.</li>
			<li>Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.</li>
		</ol>
		<figcaption>The order of operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The conventions above are collectively called the
		<span class="boldText">order of operations</span>. Again, these are
		conventions. They are not universal truths; they're simply what
		mathematicians have come to agree to about how mathematics is communicated
		and understood.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Operations as Trees.</span> One way to think about the
		order of operations is that it is a way for us to distinguish between
		different "trees" (the diagrams below are called
		<span class="boldText">binary trees</span>, to be covered in further detail
		in later sections). For example, suppose we had the following expression:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2 \times 4 + 6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Without the order of operations, the expression above could be $(2 \times
		4)+6$, which can be visualized as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/orderOperations_binaryTree1.svg' %}"
			alt="binary tree"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>Or, it could be $2 \times (4+6)$:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/orderOperations_binaryTree2.svg' %}"
			alt="binary tree"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The order of operations tells us that we perform additions and subtractions
		from left to right, so the "correct" tree is $(2 \times 4) + 6$, the first
		tree. Really, the order of operations is governed by one rule, evaluate
		expressions inside the parentheses first, and the remaining rules tell us
		<span class="italicsText">where</span> to place parentheses when they are
		absent. The parentheses, in turn, allow us to distinguish between different
		<span class="italicsText">trees</span>.

		We can see that the commutative property of addition is by adding any real
		numbers: ${2 + 7 = 7 + 2 = 9;}$ ${1 + 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.}$ The
		commutative property of addition essentially allows us to move addends as
		needed.

		Here too the commutative property of multiplication is apparent by
		multiplying any real numbers: ${4 \times 5 = 5 \times 4 = 20;}$ ${(2)(4)(3)
		= (4)(3)(2) = 24.}$ The commutative property of multiplication allows us to
		move factors as needed; a particular useful property for quick computation.

		<p>
			There are 100 terms in this problem. The first term can be paired and
			added with the last term, the second term with the second to last, the
			third with the third to last, etc.: ${(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98)
			\ldots + (49 + 52) + (50 + 51).}$ Each of these pairs sums to 101. There
			are 50 pairs total, so the sum is: ${50 \cdot 101 = 5050.}$ This
			computation is attributed to the great mathematician Karl Gauss while he
			was a schoolboy.
