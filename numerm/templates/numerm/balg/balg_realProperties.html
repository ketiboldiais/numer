<h1>Properties of Real Numbers</h1>

<section id="intro">
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			A Roman walks into a bar, holds up two fingers and says, &#8220;I'll have
			five beers.&#8221;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<span class="drop">N</span>umbers have been around for a long time. Early
		humans used all sorts of ways to record their enumerations: Scratches on
		cave walls and bones; knots on strings; pebbles and shells; notches cut into
		twigs &mdash; all attempts to quantify, to make sense of the environment.
		It's as if the numbers revealed themselves magically.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what is it really magic? Or was it purely out of necessity? The
		intuitive response is that our ancestors needed to quantify objects. Perhaps
		the earliest hunters needed to determine how much game was needed for the
		village. Or the chief having to decide a fair tribute. But this response
		neglects the fact that our forebears weren't just concerned with survival.
		They were also deeply superstitious.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the earliest forms of counting date to religious ceremonies and
		mysticism. Many of these ceremonies required
		<span class="italicsText">ordering</span> participants and events, hinting
		at the possibility that the
		<span class="term">ordinal numbers</span> &mdash; numbers used to denote
		position &mdash; came before the
		<span class="term">cardinal numbers</span> &mdash; numbers used for
		quantity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Indeed, there's a plausible argument there. Some of the earliest forms of
		the cardinal numbers were rudimentary and simple, in contrast to their
		ordinal counterparts. Cardinal numbers were limited to ${2,}$ and anything
		beyond that was a word for &#8220;many&#8221; or &#8220;lots.&#8221;
		Moreover, the view that the ordinals preceded the cardinals would be in line
		with the recurring phenomenon of dividing the integers into
		&#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female,&#8221; an idea that would eventually
		lead to &#8220;odd&#8221; and &#8220;even.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		Regardless of whether the ordinal or the cardinal came first, the human need
		for numerating grew increasingly complex. And as complexity increased, so
		too did our sophistication. Sticks, stones, and bones were too ephemeral, so
		we developed
		<span class="term">number systems</span> to more efficiently analyze our
		states of affairs. As far back as 3600 BC, the Ancient Egyptians used a
		numbering system where every ${10}$ unique characters could be abstracted,
		or symbolized, by a new, unique character. The Egyptian system evidences one
		of the earliest forms of a <span class="term">base-10 system</span>, or
		<span class="term">decimal system</span>. Unlike the number system we're
		familiar with, the Ancient Egyptian number system introduced a new symbol
		for every ${10}$ symbols. In other words, a symbol for ${1,}$ then for every
		ten ${1s}$, a symbol for ${10,}$ then ${100,}$ then ${1,000,}$ then
		${10,000,}$ then ${100,000,}$ and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Centuries later, the Greeks concocted their own number system, where a
		unique character for ${5}$ was introduced. The ancient Romans followed suit,
		utilizing the familiar capital letter numerals now relegated to formal
		headings and cryptic date tattoos. The numerals ${I,}$ ${II,}$ and ${III}$
		are derived directly from using three fingers to symbolize ${3;}$ the
		numeral ${V}$ from the angle formed by all five fingers; and ${X}$ from the
		joining of two ${V.}$ The numeral ${C}$ represented ${100,}$ and half of a
		${C}$ &mdash; an ${L}$ &mdash; represented ${50.}$ The numeral ${M}$
		represented ${1,000.}$ Split it in half and turn it on its side, we obtain
		something that looks like ${D,}$ the numeral for ${500.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The ancient Mayans too had a sophisticated and flourishing number system,
		where dots and tallies were used as numerals. The beauty in the Mayan system
		was its strong connection to addition. Numerals logically followed from
		arithmetic. In contrast to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the ancient
		Mayans introduced a new, unique character for every ${20}$ symbols, an
		example of a <span class="term">base-20 system</span>, or
		<span class="term">vigesimal system</span>. Moreover, like the ancient
		Egyptians, the Mayans understood the need to represent zero and assigned it
		a unique symbol &mdash; well before zero was accepted in Europe.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ancient China, whose characters made their way into the Korean peninsula and
		the Japanese isles, developed a number system from a mixture of pictographs
		and arithmetic. Unlike the Mayans and their connection to addition, the
		Chinese number system draws directly from multiplication and addition. By
		incorporating two arithmetic operators, the Chinese number system allowed
		for a smaller set of numerals, which in turn permitted efficient enumeration
		of large quantities.
	</p>
	<p>
		The numerals we use today are the
		<span class="term">Hindu-Arabic numerals</span>, derived from Hindu and
		Arabic number systems. Developed about ${2,000}$ years ago in India, the
		numerals made their way into Europe, via the Spanish peninsula. The Moors
		(Spanish Muslims), in their search for trade, brought both the Hindu-Arabic
		numerals and Ancient Greek philosophy, preserved by Arabic scholars. In the
		12th century, Leonardo Fibonacci, for whom the Fibonacci numbers are named,
		furthered the numerals spread into continental Europe. By the 15th century,
		the Roman numerals &mdash; until then the predominant symbols &mdash; were
		entirely replaced by the Hindu-Arabic numerals we know today.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of this is to say that there is a distinction between a
		<span class="italicsText">numeral</span> and a
		<span class="italicsText">number</span>. The numeral is purely a symbol. We
		could have just as easily continued using Roman symbols to do mathematics,
		just as medieval Europeans did. Understanding this distinction is crucial
		for when we study numbers. The Chinese symbol 五 is different from the
		Hindu-Arabic symbol ${5}$, but they both communicate the same idea &mdash;
		the number five. Often, we'll find that numerals are inappropriate for a
		particular analysis because of the underlying idea they communicate &mdash;
		a discrete number. In those situations, we must let go of the numeral
		abstraction, and think in different terms, different symbols, and different
		relationships. To do so effectively, we study the properties of the real
		numbers.

			The fundamental properties of real numbers to be investigated.

	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's cover some rudimentary rules and definitions about numbers. We will
		often revisit these topics over and over again, as numbers cannot be avoided
		in mathematics.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="integers">
	<h3>Integers</h3>
	<p>
		The <span class="term">integers</span> are the numbers we use for counting
		(also called the <span class="term">cardinal numbers</span> in other
		contexts), and their negatives. They are denoted with the special symbol,
		${\Z,}$ from the German <span class="italicsText">zehr</span>, meaning
		&#8220;number&#8221;.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>
			${ \Z = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1, 0,
			1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} }$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Some elementary mathematical texts call the counting numbers the
		<span class="italicsText">whole numbers</span>, and go so far as to denote
		them with the symbol ${\mathbb{W}.}$ This terminology is seldom used in
		higher level mathematics, so we'll stick to the more common
		<span class="italicsText">integers</span>. Nevertheless, the idea of a whole
		number is helpful for communicating the notion of an integer, so we'll
		momentarily use it.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what is a whole number? We can think of the whole number as such: If a
		number has at least one non-zero digit after its decimal point, then it is
		not a &#8220;whole number&#8221; because we cannot count from or to zero
		with that number exactly <span class="underlineText">1 unit</span> at a time
		on the number line. For example, ${1.1}$ is not a whole number, because no
		matter how much we try, to get to zero, we have to subtract ${0.1.}$ This is
		not 1 unit, so it does not constitute a whole number. And since it does not
		constitute a whole number, it is not an integer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The whole numbers greater than ${0}$ are called the
		<span class="term">positive integers</span>. We can think of these numbers
		as the numbers we use to count forwards (e.g., inserting a certain amount of
		objects into a space).
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${\Z^{+} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} }$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice symbol for the set, a zehr with a superscripted plus sign. And the
		whole numbers less than ${0}$ are called the
		<span class="term">negative integers</span>. Here, we can think of these
		numbers as the numbers we use to count backwards (e.g., removing a certain
		number of objects from a space).
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>
			${\Z^{-} = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2, \texttt{-}1
			\} }$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The number ${0}$ is neither negative nor positive. It has a special duality:
		It is both a
		<span class="term">non-positive</span> and
		<span class="term">non-negative</span> number. The non-positive integers are
		negative integers including zero:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>
			${\Z_{\leq 0} = \{ \ldots , \texttt{-}4, \texttt{-}3, \texttt{-}2,
			\texttt{-}1, 0 \} }$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		and the <span class="italicsText">non-negative integers</span> are the
		positive integers including zero:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${\Z_{\geq 0} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \} }$</p>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="naturals">
	<h3>The Natural Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		We define the <span class="term">natural numbers</span> as the positive
		integers including zero (i.e., the nonnegative integers). These are what we
		refer to as the counting numbers in regular speech. Importantly,
		mathematicians differ on whether ${0}$ is a natural number. This is more a
		matter of convenience than anything else, but in these materials, we follow
		the premise that ${0}$ is a natural number. If there is a variation, we will
		explicitly state that ${0}$ is not included in the set.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${\N = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots \} }$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Some texts define the natural numbers as the positive integers, and instead
		refer to the nonnegative integers as the
		<span class="term">whole numbers</span>. For reasons beyond the scope of the
		current discussion, defining the natural numbers as including zero has
		benefits for later sections.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the natural numbers covered, we can begin discussing some laws of
		arithmetic. There are many other number sets, but we will explore them as we
		encounter a need for their definitions.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="laws_of_arithmetic">
	<h2>Laws of Arithmetic</h2>
	<p>
		The following materials discuss <span class="term">arithmetic</span>, the
		set of rules and conventions governing the manipulation of numbers. The word
		<span class="italicsText">arithmetic</span> is derived from the Greek
		<span class="italicsText">arithmetike</span>, meaning &#8220;art of
		counting,&#8221; which is itself derived from the Greek
		<span class="italicsText">arithmos,</span> meaning &#8220;number.&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>There are four basic arithmetic operators:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<th>Symbol</th>
				<th>Operation</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>$a + b$</td>
					<td>Addition</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a - b$</td>
					<td>Subtraction</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a \times b$</td>
					<td>Multiplication</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$\dfrac{a}{b}$</td>
					<td>Division</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a^b$</td>
					<td>Exponentiation</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<figcaption>Basic operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Above, we used the letters $a$ and $b$. These are called
		<span class="term">variables</span>. They are simply placeholders that we
		can plug numbers, other variables, or even other operations with variables
		into. Variables allow us to <span class="term">generalize</span>, or
		<span class="term">abstract</span>, statements. For example, ${2 + 2 = 4}$,
		and ${3 + 8 = 11}$. We make an abstraction of this pattern, or idea, by
		writing something like ${a + b = n.}$ This communicates the idea, &#8220;The
		number ${n}$ is the sum of ${a}$ and ${b.}$&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many ways to read an equation, but they all express the same idea.
		The human mind, however, is a peculiar thing. Often, reading and writing the
		same equation in different ways can lead to drastically different insights.
		Consider all the different ways we can read ${a + b = n:}$ The sum of ${a}$
		and ${b}$ is ${n.}$ The number ${n}$ is the sum of ${a}$ and ${b.}$ The
		numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ such that the sum is ${n.}$ The number ${b}$ is the
		difference of ${n}$ and ${a.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		All of this is to say that addition and subtraction are just fast and
		flexible ways to express counting forwards and backwards. For example, the
		expression ${4 + 8}$ is just another way of saying &#8220;Count ${8}$
		positions from ${4}$.&#8221; This leads to: ${5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.}$
		This in turn is just another way of saying &#8220;Count ${12}$ positions
		from ${0}$&#8221; or &#8220;Count ${1}$ position from ${11.}$&#8221; Notice
		that with these addition (and subtraction), we are just
		<span class="italicsText">offsetting</span> from one or the other of the
		operands. ${1 + 1}$ is simply &#8220;1 offset 1,&#8221; which is ${2.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		All of this evidences that addition and subtraction are
		<span class="term">abstractions</span> of counting. Abstractions are useful
		because they allow us greater flexibility and accuracy with our statements.
		Suppose we want to say, "I'm looking for two numbers that add to 10." We can
		write: $a + b = 10$. This flexibility and accuracy is a powerful tool in
		mathematics, because it gives us plenty of room to write statements that say
		what we can and cannot do &mdash; rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Understanding the basic rules of arithmetic at a very high level is
		priceless in mathematics. Part of the elegance and power of mathematics is
		that we can arrive at beautiful, and often shocking, results from a set of
		very basic rules.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="laws_of_addition">
	<h3>Addition</h3>
	<p>
		Addition can be thought of as moving to the right along the real number line
		by whatever number we are adding. So, for example, the expression ${4 + 2}$
		can be thought of as "Start at 4, and move 2 to the right." This give us the
		final destination of 6. Subtraction is really just addition, only instead of
		moving towards the right, we move towards the left. For example, $4 - 3$ is
		really $4 + (-3)$, returning 1. Visually:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/number_line_arithmetic.svg' %}"
			alt="number line"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Importantly, we should always think of addition as a
		<span class="term">binary operator</span>: An operation that requires two
		inputs, called <span class="term">operands</span>. For example, ${1 + 1}$ or
		${3 + 8.}$ Now, we might be thinking, hang on &mdash; what about ${1 + 1 +
		1?}$ That has three operands. Well, not really. The expression ${1 + 1 + 1 =
		(1 + 1) + 1.}$ We introduce this perspective because it provides a few
		helpful points later down the line. First, thinking about addition as only
		needing two operands is helpful when we encounter more complex expressions.
		Second, the fact that addition is a binary operation doesn't prevent us from
		having more than two operands; it just ensures that we don't write something
		like ${1+.}$
	</p>

	<section id="identity_property_of_addition">
		<h4>Identity Property of Addition</h4>
		<p>
			Pius, a bank robber, goes to Ultimate Safety Bank, and robs it. He leaves
			with 4,000 dollars. Pius then goes to another bank Safer Bank, 4,000
			dollars and fake gun in hand, and tells the teller to put the money in the
			bag. The teller takes the bag, disappears below the counter, and pretends
			to place money in the bag; the teller, in fact, didn't place anything in
			the bag. She returns the bag, and Pius sprints out the building to his
			e-scooter, and zooms away. He gets home and opens the bag. How much money
			does Pius have?
		</p>
		<p>
			Pius starts with 0, then takes 4,000 from Ultimate Safety, then goes to
			Safer Bank, and gets 0. When we add 0 to a number, we are effectively
			saying "no movement" along the number line. Thus, we have the following
			rule:

					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</section>

	<section id="adding_negative_and_positive_numbers">
		<h4>Subtraction</h4>
		<p>
			Knowing whether operands are negative or positive can allow us to
			immediately conclude certain propositions. First, the sum of two positive
			integers is a positive integer.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Property.</span> If ${a, b \in \Z^{+},}$ then ${a
					+ b \in \Z^{+}.}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			From the rule property above, we have a further property: The sum of two
			negative numbers is a negative number.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Definition.</span> If ${a, b \in \Z^{-},}$ then
					${a + b \in \Z^{-}.}$

		<p>
			The operation of subtraction is not exactly an independent operation.
			Really, subtraction is just addition with a negative. The
			&#8220;operation&#8221; of subtraction is really just a shorthand way for
			writing out addition of positive and negative numbers. For example, when
			we write ${a + (-b),}$< we instead just write ${a - b.}$ It's just a
			faster way of writing the same expression.
		</p>
		<p>
			The identity property of addition leads to the additive inverse. As
			aforementioned, subtraction is really just adding negative numbers.
			Considering the addition with zero rule, we have the following inference:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Additive Inverse.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Given the equation ${a + (-a) = 0}$, we say that ${-a}$ is the
			<span class="term">additive inverse</span> of ${a.}$ Whenever we see the
			equation ${-a + a = 0}$, we should immediately become aware that we ${a}$
			and ${-a}$ are on opposite sides of 0 on the real line. Furthermore,
			because ${-a + a = 0}$, subtracting ${-a}$ from both sides, we have ${-a =
			-(-a)}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			The additive inverse also allows us to draw another inference. Given the
			equation ${a + x = a,}$ we should immediately know that ${x = 0.}$
			Similary, if we see the equation ${a + x = 0,}$ then we should immediately
			know that ${x = -a.}$
		</p>

	<section id="commutative_property_of_addition">
		<h4>Commutative Property of Addition</h4>
		<p>Say we have The commutative law of addition states that:</p>
		<figure class="display-math">
			<div>
				<p>$a + b = b + a$</p>
			</div>

			In other words, the order of terms in addition does not change the sum of

			The idea is made apparent from a simple analogy. If we want sweet iced

			then the ice, and so on and so forth. Either or, the result is the same

	<section id="associative_property_of_addition">
		<h4>Associative Law of Addition</h4>
		<p>
			The associative law of addition states that the sum of the terms does not
			depend on the grouping of the terms. In other words, we can group the
			terms however way we'd like.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Associative Property of Addition.</span> Given
					${a, b, c \in \R,}$ then:

				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We call the property above more generally as
			<span class="term">associativity</span>. We can remember it as, &#8220;In
			addition, the terms are free to
			<span class="italicsText">associate</span>.&#8221; In other words, the
			terms can gather together or separate as they please, as long as they stay
			within addition (and again, as we'll see later, multiplication).
		</p>
		<p>
			From the definition above, if we have the expression ${a + b + c + d,}$ we
			can generate numerous different possibilities:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a + b + c + d}$</p>
				<p>${((a + b) + c) + d}$</p>
				<p>${a + ((b + c) + d)}$</p>
				<p>${a + (b + (c + d))}$</p>
				<p>${(a + b) + (c + d)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			All these possibilities are equivalent, but some may be easier to compute
			than others.
		</p>
		<p>The associative law of addition leads to another useful property:</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>If $a + b = 0$, then $b = -a$ and $a = -b$.</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The above property is the direct result of subtracting either $a$ or $b$
			from both sides. Associativity and commutativity are what allow us to
			rewrite expressions in numerous different ways:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>$(a - b) + c = (a + (-b)) + c$</p>
				<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (-b + c)$ by associativity</p>
				<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (c - b)$ by commutativity</p>
				<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = (a + c) - b$ by associativity</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Importantly, the associative property of addition
			<span class="underlineText">does not apply</span> to subtraction. For
			example, ${a - b}$ does not imply that ${b - a.}$ ${a - b}$ is equivalent
			to ${a + (-b),}$ but it is not equivalent to ${b + (-a).}$ The proposition
			${a - b = b - a}$ is true iff ${a = b.}$

		Multiplication is simply repeated addition. Accordingly, we can think of

			tablespoons of sugar would you like?&#8221; The man replies,

			The zero property of multiplication may seem straightforward, but it leads
			a particularly useful fact to keep in mind. The equation ${a \cdot b = a
			\cdot c}$ does not immediately imply that ${b = c.}$ Why? Because if ${a =
			0,}$ then either ${b}$ or ${c}$ could be any real number and ${b \neq c.}$
			Never assume that ${ab = ac}$ implies ${b = c}$ without first verifying,
			or stating explicitly, that ${a \neq 0.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, if we know that ${a \cdot b = 0,}$ then we have three
			possibilities: (1) ${a = 0,}$ (2) ${b = 0,}$ or (3) ${a = 0}$
			<span class="underlineText">and</span> ${b = 0.}$

			As an aside, the coffee example above is a play on the philosopher Slavoj
			Zizek's joke:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				A man comes into a restaurant. He sits down at the table and he says,
				“Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee without cream.” Five minutes later,
				the waiter comes back and says, “I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream. Can
				it be without milk?”
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Zizek's joke is an attempt at revitilizing Hegelian logic through an
			alternative reading. The idea is that the existence of a negation can be
			just as significant and worthy of consideration as the negation itself. In
			other words, when we encounter the proposition &#8220;coffee without
			cream&#8221;, it's just as important to consider the possibility that
			what's being expressed is not &#8220;coffee
			<span class="italicsText">without cream</span>&#8221;, but rather
			&#8220;coffee <span class="italicsText">without</span>&#8221;.
		</p>
		<p>
			This idea has its roots in Kant's essay
			<span class="title"
				>An Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes of
				Philosophy</span
			>. There, Kant presented a thought experiment: Two equal forces start at
			zero. One moves five feet to the right, the other moves five feet to the
			left. Is the zero resulting from their movement different from the zero
			they started at? Kant argued yes, they are different. The "zero" resulting
			from the two forces cancelling one another is different from the zero
			before any force moved. The ${+5}$ and the ${-5}$ have in themselves a
			${0,}$ in that ${+5}$ means &#8220;Move 5 to the right from ${0}$&#8221;
			and ${-5}$ means &#8220;Move 5 to the left from ${0.}$&#8221; That
			inherent ${0}$ never went anywhere. It's always been there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hegel took this several steps further by arguing that the zero we get from
			${5 + (-5)}$ is not only different, but that the process of negation
			alters the very thing we're negating. ${5 + (-5)}$ results in a non-being
			${0,}$ from a process that starts with a being, the origin ${0.}$ This is
			the act of <span class="italicsText">negation</span>, and its result is
			different from zero, which represents nothingness. In Hegel's view,
			nothingness is always there. It requires no action by another to
			&#8220;be&#8221;. In contrast, negation &mdash; the act of ${(5) + (-5)}$
			&mdash; requires an action by another.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hegel's arguments on negation (and logic in general), no doubt had an
			impact on mathematical logic. In particular, Hegel's formulation of the
			<span class="italicsText">absolute</span> (a concept that follows from his
			work on negations) is contemporaneous with the concept of
			<span class="italicsText">absolute value</span>, a topic to be discussed
			in later sections.

						How many 8s do we need to arrive at a sum where the last digit is 0?

		that ${ a + b - a -b = 0 }$. Rearranging the equation, we have ${ a - a + b
		- b = 0 }$. Rearranging again, we have: ${ -(a + b) = -a + (-b) }$. This
		yields the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${ -(a + b) = -a - b }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note that we should always be vigilant about distributing a minus sign to a
		sum involving negative numbers: ${ -(-a) = a }$. To ensure that vigilance,
		we should make the following rules clear:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are positive integers, then ${ a + b }$ is a
			positive integer.
		</li>
		<li>
			If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are negative integers, then ${ a + b }$ is a
			negative integer.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We can see that these rules are true with a simple proof. Let ${ a = -n }$
		and ${ b = -m }$, where ${ m }$ and ${ n }$ are positive. It follows then
		that ${ a + b = -n - m = -(n + m) }$. Since ${ n }$ and ${ m }$ are
		positive, ${ n + m }$ is positive. Since ${ n + m }$ is positive, it follows
		that ${ a + b }$ is negative, because ${ n + m }$ is positive only if ${ a +
		b }$ is negative.
	</p>
	<p>
		This analysis hints at another law, the
		<span class="term">distributive property.</span> Stated formally:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Distributive Property.</span> If ${a, b, c \in \R,}$
				then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a(b + c) = ab + ac}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With the distribute property, we have another way of proving that ${a \cdot
		0 = 0:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} (a \cdot 0) + (a \cdot 0) &= a \cdot (0 + 0) \\ &= a
			\cdot 0 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The distributive property is also what leads to what at first appears to be
		a mysterious rule: The product of two negative numbers is a positive number.
		First, we start by proving that ${(-a)(b) = -(a \cdot b):}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} (-a)(b) + (a)(b) &= ((-a) + a)(b) \\ &= (0)(b) \\ &= 0
			\end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because ${(-a)(b) = -(a \cdot b),}$ we can make the following inferences.
		First, the factor ${(-a)(b) = -(ab).}$ Adding ${-(ab)}$ to both sides:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} (-a)(-b) + (-(ab)) &= (-a)(-b) + (-ab) \\ &= (-a) \cdot
			((-b) + b) \\ &= (-a) \cdot 0 \\ &= 0 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Adding ${(a)(b)}$ to both sides:</p>

		<div>${(-a)(-b) = (a)(b)}$</div>

<section id="inequalities">
	<h2>Inequalities</h2>
	<p>
		Inequalities arguably appear more often than equalities in mathematics. This
		is because equality imposes an extraordinarily high burden of proof: When we
		write ${a = b,}$ we are implying that ${a}$ and ${b}$ are the same in every
		possible way. Because of that burden, we often must speak in terms of
		relativity, using the symbols ${>, <, \leq, \geq, \nless, \ngtr, \nleq,
		\ngeq.}$ Let's discuss how each of these symbols are used and the
		propositions they can express.
	</p>

	<p>
		First, when we write ${a > b,}$ we are stating,
		<span class="italicsText">${a}$ is greater than ${b.}$</span> The same
		proposition can be written as ${b < a.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, if ${a < 0,}$ we say that ${a}$ is
		<span class="term">negative</span>. If ${a > 0,}$ we say that ${a}$ is
		<span class="term">positive</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Third, the inequality symbols operate similarly to the equal sign: There are
		two sides, and we can manipulate the expression accordingly &mdash; so long
		as the expression remains true. For example, consider the proposition ${a >
		b.}$ We can manipulate this expression as such:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} a &> b \\ a - b &> b - b \\ a - b &> 0 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We see that given the expression ${a > b,}$ it follows that ${a - b}$ is
		positive. This analysis leads to several laws. First, the
		<span class="term">Trichotomy law</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Trichotomy Law.</span> For every ${a \in \R,}$ one,
				and only one, of the following propositions is true:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>${a = 0}$</li>
				<li>${a \in \R^{+}}$</li>
				<li>${-a \in \R^{+}}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The rule above tells us that every real number ${a}$ can be only one of
		three things: zero, positive, or negative. Those are the only three possible
		states. Nothing else. Additionally, we have the
		<span class="italicsText">laws of closure</span>. We can think of these laws
		as defining the boundaries of addition and multiplication. First, the
		<span class="italicsText">law of closure under addition</span>:
	</p>
</section>

<section id="exponents">
	<h2>Exponentiation</h2>
	<p>
		We can get by with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
		and division alone. However, having just these operations would be
		particularly cumbersome for many mathematical statements. Consider for
		example, the following expression:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${xxxxxxx + xxx}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is difficult to parse, and delimiting with parentheses and operator
		symbols is no better:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x) + (x)(x)(x)}$</p>
			<p>
				${x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x + x \cdot x \cdot
				x}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Even worse:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${xxxxxxx \times xxx = xxxxxxxxxx}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As an aside, the eighth power of a number is called zenzizenzizenzic. Coined
		by the 16th century Welsh physician Robert Recorde, the root of the word is
		&#8220;zenzic,&#8221; The German spelling of the Latin &#8220;censo,&#8221;
		meaning &#8220;squared.&#8221; At the time, there was no easy way to denote
		powers of numbers, so various forms of &#8220;zenzic&#8221; were used:
		zenzic for squared, zenzizenzic for the square of a square, and
		zenzizenzizenzic for the square of a square of a square.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of this difficulty, we have the special operation of
		<span class="term">exponentiation</span>. We can think of this as repeated
		multiplication. And because multiplication is already a pretty fast way of
		counting, exponentiation is even faster.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${xxxxxxx + xxx = x^7 + x^3}$</p>
			<p>${xxxxxxx \times xxx = x^7 \times x^3 = x^{10}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From the multiplication example, we have the following rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Product Rule of Exponents.</span> For any ${a \in
				\R,}$ given ${m \in \N}$ and ${n \in \N:}$

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a^m a^n = a^{m + n}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now, consider the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a} =
				\dfrac{a^4}{a^5}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Really, this reduces to:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot
				\cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot
				\cancel{a} \cdot a} = \dfrac{1}{a}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The computation above provides us this rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Quotient Rule of Exponents.</span> For any ${a
				\in \R,}$ and ${m \in \N,}$ ${n \in \N,}$ such that ${m > n,}$
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>and this rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Negative Rule of Exponents</span>. For any ${a
				\in \R,}$ and ${n \in \N,}$

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From the <span class="italicsText">Quotient Rule of Exponents</span>, we can
		observe:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a} = \dfrac{a^3}{a^3}}$</p>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot
				\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}} = a^{3-3}}$
			</p>
			<p>${\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = a^0}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we have the rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Zero Exponent Rule.</span> For any ${\{a \in \R
				: a \neq 0 \},}$
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a^0 = 1.}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The <span class="italicsText">Zero Exponent Rule</span> as applied to the
		number ${0}$ &mdash; ${0^0}$ &mdash; is a point of debate. Some
		mathematicians treat 0 as ${0^0 = 1.}$ In algebra and calculus, however,
		${0^0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$ In computer science, programming
		languages handle ${0^0}$ in numerous different ways; some languages provide
		an explicit value (i.e., 1), others undefined, others return an error.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each approach has valid premises. If you consider ${x^y}$ as a function of
		two variables, then we have a problem with the definition ${0^0 = 1.}$ If we
		approach 0 along the line ${y = 0,}$ then following the definition,
		${\lim\limits_{x \to 0^{+}} = 1.}$ However, if we approach 0 along the line
		${x = 0,}$ then we get ${\lim\limits_{y \to 0^{y}} = \lim\limits_{y \to
		0^{+}}0 = 0.}$ This would mean ${0^0 = 0.}$ Thus, continuous mathematics
		generally treats ${0^0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, discrete mathematics treats ${0^0 = 1.}$ In set theory,
		${A^B}$ denotes the set of all functions from ${B}$ to ${A.}$ If ${A}$ and
		${B}$ denote the cardinalities (i.e., the &#8220;size&#8221; of the sets)
		then ${A^B}$ is the size of the set of all functions from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ If
		we use the value 0 for ${A}$ and ${B,}$ then 0 denotes the empty set &mdash;
		${0^0}$ is the collection of all functions from the empty set to the empty
		set. This is the <span class="italicsText">empty function</span>. There is
		one, and only one, empty function. Accordingly, ${0^0 = 1.}$ Thus, it must
		be true that ${0^0 = 1.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		In these materials, we will limit the
		<span class="italicsText">Zero Exponent Rule</span> to a number ${x}$ where
		${\{ x \in \R : x \neq 0 \}.}$
	</p>
	<p>Next, consider the following example:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(b^3)^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>This expression captures:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Following the associative property of multiplication:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b) = b \cdot b \cdot b
				\cdot b \cdot b \cdot b}$
			</p>
			<p>${\phantom{(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)} = b^6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Again, we have another rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Power Rule of Exponents.</span> For any ${a \in
				\R,}$ and ${m \in \N,}$ ${n \in \N,}$
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The commutative and associative properties of multiplication naturally lead
		to another rule. Consider the following:
	</p>
	<div class="mproof">
		<div class="premises">
			<ul>
				<li>${(ab)^3 = (ab) \cdot (ab) \cdot (ab)}$</li>
				<li>Expansion</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					${\phantom{(ab)^3} = a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b}$
				</li>
				<li>Associative Property</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					${\phantom{(ab)^3} = (a \cdot a \cdot a) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)}$
				</li>
				<li>Commutative Property</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>${\phantom{(ab)^3} = a^{3}b^{3}}$</li>
				<li>Definition of Exponent</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Thus, it follows that:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Power of a Product Rule of Exponents.</span> For
				all ${a, b \in \R,}$ given a ${n \in \N,}$

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${(ab)^n = a^n b^n}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This rule leads to another rule. Consider the expression
		${(a^{-2}b^{2})^3.}$ Expanding and reducing this expression:
	</p>
	
	<table class="proof">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>${(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)^3}$</td>

	<h3>Perfect Powers</h3>
	<p>
		With exponentiation, we arrive at several special properties. First, we have

		perfect square looks something like:

	<figure class="math-display">

	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice the pattern. These are all numbers that can be written in the form
		${n^2,}$ where ${n}$ is some integer. for example, ${9}$ is a perfect square
		because it can be written as ${3^2.}$ So too are ${1}$ and ${0.}$ They can
		be written as ${1^2}$ and ${0^2,}$ respectively. Formally:

<section id="closure">
	<h2>Closure</h2>
	<p>
		Even without a sophisticated understanding of number theory, we know that
		adding a whole number to a whole number always returns a whole number. E.g.,
		${1 + 1 = 2,}$ ${2 + 5 = 7,}$ ${1132+ 324 = 1456.}$ Formally, we call this
		phenomenon the <span class="term">closure property</span>.

		From the property above, we say that the natural numbers are
		<span class="italicsText">closed</span> under addition and multiplication.
		In other words, if we add two natural numbers, then the sum is a natural
		number. If we multiply two natural numbers, then the product is natural
		number.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the property above, we can draw a few other useful properties. First,
		because we define the natural numbers as including 0, the set of natural
		numbers is a superset of the positive integers. Accordingly:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Corollary.</span> Let ${a, b \in \N}$ then:</p>

	<p>
		In other words, the set of positive integers is closed under addition and
		multiplication. If we add two positive integers, then the sum is a positive
		integer. If we multiply two positive integers, then the product is a
		positive integer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the natural numbers' closure property applies only to addition and
		multiplication. It does not apply to division and subtraction.

<section id="division">
	<h3>Division & Divisibility</h3>
	<p>
		Of the core arithmetic operators, division is the most complex. In any
		discussion of division, we must first begin with two subsets of integers,
		the <span class="term">even integers</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\{ 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \}}$</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that both the even integers and the odd integers increment by 2. The
		difference, however, is that the even integers start at 2, and the odd
		integers start at 1. A number's property of odd-ness or even-ness is called
		the number's <span class="term">parity</span>. Note that parity is a
		property held only by the positive integers. The negative integers are
		neither even nor odd. We can abstract this idea with algebra: An even
		integer is an integer that can be written as ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a
		positive integer. Denoting the set of even integers with the symbol
		${\Z_{\text{even}},}$ and the set of positive integers with the symbol
		${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ we can define an even integer more formally as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${x \in \Z.}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \in \Z_{\text{even}} \iff x = 2k : k \in \Z^{+}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is even if, and only if, it can be written in the
				form ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>For the odd integers, we write:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${x \in \Z.}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k - 1 : k \in \Z^{+}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the
				form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a positive integer.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Alternatively, we can define odd integers as the following:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${x \in \Z.}$</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \iff x = 2k + 1 : k \in \N}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the
				form ${2k + 1,}$ where ${k}$ is a natural number.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The only meaningful difference between the first and second definition is
		whether ${k}$ is a natural number or a positive integer. In other words,
		whether ${k}$ can be 0. If ${k}$ can be 0, then we must change the
		definition from ${2k - 1}$ to ${2k + 1,}$ because if ${k = 0,}$ then ${2k -
		1 = -1.}$ ${-1}$ is neither odd nor even, because parity is a property that
		applies only to positive integers (0 is also neither odd nor even).
	</p>
	<p>
		Knowing the parity of two integers allows us to quickly determine the parity
		of their sums:

		<div class="rule">

		The property above tells us that the square of an even integer is even, and
		the square of an odd integer is odd.
	</p>
	<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Prove the theorem above.</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proof (by direct proof).</span> Given ${a \in
			\Z^{+},}$ there are two hypotheses to be proved:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>If ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even.</p>
				<p>If ${a}$ is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd.</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We prove each hypothesis in turn, beginning with the first hypothesis.
			Suppose ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$ Since ${a}$ is an even integer, then
			by definition, ${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n,}$ where ${n}$
			is a positive integer. By substitution:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n)^2}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the definition of an exponent:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n)(2n)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the associative property of multiplication:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2)(2 \cdot n \cdot n)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the definition of an exponent:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2)(2n^2)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because the product of positive integer is a positive integer, the intger
			${2n^2}$ is a positive integer. Hence:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2m}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${m}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2m}$ is an even integer by
			definition, ${a^2}$ is even.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, we consider the second hypothesis. Suppose ${a \in
			\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ Given that ${a}$ is an odd integer, then by definition,
			${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n + 1,}$ where ${n}$ is a
			positive integer. By substitution:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n + 1)^2}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By expansion:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By associativity:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (4n^2 + 4n) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By distributivity:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because ${n}$ is a positive integer, ${2n^2 + 2n}$ is a positive integer.
			Hence:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2k + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2k + 1}$ is an odd integer by
			definition, ${a^2}$ is odd.
		</p>

	<p>The theorem above yields a corollary:</p>

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Corollary.</span> Let ${a \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$</p>
					<p>${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		As with many corollaries, the propositions above are implied by the previous
		theorem. If ${a^2}$ is even, then ${a}$ must be even, for if ${a}$ is odd,
		then ${a^2}$ is odd. Similarly, if ${a^2}$ is odd, then ${a}$ must be odd,
		for if ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even. This is a straightforward
		example of logical contradiction.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is from parity that we generalize the concept of
		<span class="term">divisibility</span>. Suppose ${a}$ is a positive integer
		and ${b}$ is an integer. When we say that ${b}$ is divisible by ${a,}$ we
		mean that ${a}$ divides ${b.}$ We denote this proposition with the notation
		${a \space\vert\space b.}$ An integer ${b}$ is divisible by ${a}$ if, and
		only if, ${b = an,}$ where ${n}$ is some integer.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${a \in \Z^{+}}$ and ${b \in
				\Z.}$ Then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a \space\vert\space b \iff b = an}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>where ${n \in \Z.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The definition above yields several useful propositions:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>Every integer is divisible by 1.</li>
			<li>Every positive integer is divisible by itself.</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first proposition is implied by the fact that every integer can be
		written as ${n = (1)(n).}$ This in turn implies the second proposition.

	<h3>Composites & Primes</h3>
	<figure style="margin: 5% 0">
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/compound_prime.svg' %}"
			alt="compound numbers, prime numbers"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From the definition above, there are two subsets within the natural numbers.
		Any natural number that can be grouped into a solid rectangle is called a
		<span class="term">composite number</span> (also called
		<span class="italicsText">compound numbers</span>). More formally:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">composite number</span> ${k}$ is a natural
				number greater than 1, divisible by some positive integer ${n,}$ where
				${n \neq 1.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The negation of this definition yields the
		<span class="term">prime numbers</span>, numbers that
		<span class="underlineText">cannot</span> be grouped into a solid rectangle.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">prime number</span> ${m}$ is a natural number
				greater than 1, divisible only by 1 and itself.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note that from the definitions above, we see that the numbers 0 and 1 have a
		special property: Both 0 and 1 are neither prime nor compound.
	</p>

	<h3>Division & Rational Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		The operation of division is closely tied to the
		<span class="term">rational numbers</span>. A rational number is any number
		that can be written in the form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ or ${m/n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers, and ${n \neq 0.}$ The last condition is
		crucial, because in this particular world (classical algebra),
		<span class="underlineText">we cannot divide by 0.</span> The rational
		numbers come in various forms:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\ldots, \dfrac{1}{3}, - \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{2}{3}, 1.4, 0.08, 12.0,
				0.0, \ldots}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The rule is, as long as a number can be written as ${m/n,}$ where ${m, n}$
		are integers and ${n \neq 0,}$ then the number is rational number.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>In computer science, the rational numbers are called
			<span class="term">floats</span> or
			<span class="term">floating point numbers</span> (the decimal point
			&#8220;floats&#8221; as needed).</span
		>
		Otherwise, the number is an irrational number. Note what this definition
		means. Every integer satisfies the definition rational number definition, so
		we say that the rational numbers are a proper superset of the integers.
		I.e., every integer is a rational number, but not every rational number is
		an integer.

	<h3>The Division Algorithm</h3>
	<p>Among the operations, division is the most complicated.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise</span>. A six-digit number having 1 as its
		leftmost digit becomes three times bigger if we take this digit off and put
		it at the end of the number. What is this number?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>Let the number be $1ABCDE$.</p>
		<p>Then, $ABCDE1 = 3 \times 1ABCDE$.</p>
		<p>Rewrite this with the multiplication algorithm:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{cc} & A & B & C & D & E \\ \times & & & & & 3 \\ \hline A
			& B & C & D & E & 1 \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Let's focus on $E$. We need a digit $E$ where $3 \times E = n1$, where $n$
			is a digit. This digit must be 7, for $7 \times 3 = 21$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that $E$ is 7, so what might $D$ be? Well, we need a digit $D$
			where $(D \times 3) + 2 = 7$. Or, rearranging, $D \times 3 = 5$. The only
			digit that would satisfy this condition is $D = 5$ (since $3 \times 5 + 2
			= 17$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that $D$ is 5, so now we look at $C$. We need a digit $C$ such
			that $(C \times 3) + 1 = 5$, or, rearranging, $C \times 3 = 4$. There is
			only one digit that satisfies this condition, 8. Thus, $C = 8$.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we look at $B$. What digit satisfies the condition $B \times 3 = 6$?
			It must be 2. Therefore, $B = 2$.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we look at $A$. What digit results in $A \times 3 = 12$. It must
			be 4, since $3 \times 4 = 12$. Hence, the digits are $A = 4$, $B = 2$, $C
			= 8$, and $D = 5$.

		<p>
			This also tells us that after every six 0s, we return to 10. Thus, for

<section id="order_of_operations">
	<h2>Order of Operations</h2>
	<p>
		Arithmetic allows us to combine numbers, through the operations listed
		above, to form other numbers. The way we order operations matters in
		mathematics. Otherwise, we run into problems. For example, consider the
		following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$2 + 3 \times 4$</p>
		<figcaption>Multiple operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What does this expression mean? Well, it could be: (1) Add 2 and 3, then (2)
		multiply the sum by 4. Or, it could mean: (1) Multiply 3 and 4, and (2) add
		2 to the product. This ambiguity is unacceptable in mathematics. We need be
		clear and precise with our words. For these reason, mathematics follows a
		few conventions on how to write mathematical expressions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Evaluate expressions in parentheses first, working from the inner most
				to the outer most, applying all of these rules.
			</li>
			<li>Perform all exponentiations.</li>
			<li>Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.</li>
			<li>Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.</li>
		</ol>
		<figcaption>The order of operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The conventions above are collectively called the
		<span class="term">order of operations</span>. Again, these are conventions.
		They are not universal truths; they're simply what mathematicians have come
		to agree to about how mathematics is communicated and understood.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Operations as Trees.</span> One way to think about the
		order of operations is that it is a way for us to distinguish between
		different "trees" (the diagrams below are called
		<span class="term">binary trees</span>, to be covered in further detail in
		later sections). For example, suppose we had the following expression:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2 \times 4 + 6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Without the order of operations, the expression above could be $(2 \times
		4)+6$, which can be visualized as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/orderOperations_binaryTree1.svg' %}"
			alt="binary tree"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>Or, it could be $2 \times (4+6)$:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/orderOperations_binaryTree2.svg' %}"
			alt="binary tree"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The order of operations tells us that we perform additions and subtractions
		from left to right, so the "correct" tree is $(2 \times 4) + 6$, the first
		tree. Really, the order of operations is governed by one rule, evaluate
		expressions inside the parentheses first, and the remaining rules tell us
		<span class="italicsText">where</span> to place parentheses when they are
		absent. The parentheses, in turn, allow us to distinguish between different
		<span class="italicsText">trees</span>.

	<h3>Real Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		All of the numbers above are called
		<span class="term">real numbers</span>. In the simplest terms, a real number
		is a number that can be written as a decimal. Thus, 7 is a real number,
		since ${7 = 7.0.}$ Similarly, while ${\pi}$ is an irrational number. It is a
		real number since it can be written as a decimal (${3.14 \ldots}$), albeit
		non-terminating.

	<h3>Imaginary Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		Outside of the real numbers, we have the imaginary numbers. These are the
		numbers that result from operations such as $\sqrt{\texttt{-}1}$. We will
		treat and analyze this numbers in a separate chapter.

	<h3>The Decimal System</h3>
	<p>
		Real numbers are written in

		(with the exception of <span class="term">binary</span>, favored by
		computers). The decimal system is useful because it allows us to quickly add
