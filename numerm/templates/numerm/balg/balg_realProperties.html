<h1>Properties of Real Numbers</h1>

<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">N</span>umbers have been around for a long time. Early
		humans used all sorts of ways to record their enumerations: Scratches on
		cave walls and bones; knots on strings; pebbles and shells; notches cut into
		twigs &mdash; all attempts to quantify, to make sense of the environment.
		It's as if the numbers revealed themselves magically.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what is it really magic? Or was it purely out of necessity? The
		intuitive response is that our ancestors needed to quantify objects. Perhaps
		the earliest hunters needed to determine how much game was needed for the
		village. Or the chief having to decide a fair tribute. But this response
		neglects the fact that our forebears weren't just concerned with survival.
		They were also deeply superstitious.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of the earliest forms of counting date to religious ceremonies and
		mysticism. Many of these ceremonies required
		<span class="italicsText">ordering</span> participants and events, hinting
		at the possibility that the
		<span class="term">ordinal numbers</span> &mdash; numbers used to denote
		position &mdash; came before the
		<span class="term">cardinal numbers</span> &mdash; numbers used for
		quantity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Indeed, there's a plausible argument there. Some of the earliest forms of
		the cardinal numbers were rudimentary and simple, in contrast to their
		ordinal counterparts. Cardinal numbers were limited to ${2,}$ and anything
		beyond that was a word for &#8220;many&#8221; or &#8220;lots.&#8221;
		Moreover, the view that the ordinals preceded the cardinals would be in line
		with the recurring phenomenon of dividing the integers into
		&#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female,&#8221; an idea that would eventually
		lead to &#8220;odd&#8221; and &#8220;even.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		Regardless of whether the ordinal or the cardinal came first, the human need
		for numerating grew increasingly complex. And as complexity increased, so
		too did our sophistication. Sticks, stones, and bones were too ephemeral, so
		we developed
		<span class="term">number systems</span> to more efficiently analyze our
		states of affairs. As far back as 3600 BC, the Ancient Egyptians used a
		numbering system where every ${10}$ unique characters could be abstracted,
		or symbolized, by a new, unique character. The Egyptian system evidences one
		of the earliest forms of a <span class="term">base-10 system</span>, or
		<span class="term">decimal system</span>. Unlike the number system we're
		familiar with, the Ancient Egyptian number system introduced a new symbol
		for every ${10}$ symbols. In other words, a symbol for ${1,}$ then for every
		ten ${1s}$, a symbol for ${10,}$ then ${100,}$ then ${1,000,}$ then
		${10,000,}$ then ${100,000,}$ and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Centuries later, the Greeks concocted their own number system, where a
		unique character for ${5}$ was introduced. The ancient Romans followed suit,
		utilizing the familiar capital letter numerals now relegated to formal
		headings and cryptic date tattoos. The numerals ${I,}$ ${II,}$ and ${III}$
		are derived directly from using three fingers to symbolize ${3;}$ the
		numeral ${V}$ from the angle formed by all five fingers; and ${X}$ from the
		joining of two ${V.}$ The numeral ${C}$ represented ${100,}$ and half of a
		${C}$ &mdash; an ${L}$ &mdash; represented ${50.}$ The numeral ${M}$
		represented ${1,000.}$ Split it in half and turn it on its side, we obtain
		something that looks like ${D,}$ the numeral for ${500.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The ancient Mayans too had a sophisticated and flourishing number system,
		where dots and tallies were used as numerals. The beauty in the Mayan system
		was its strong connection to addition. Numerals logically followed from
		arithmetic. In contrast to the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the ancient
		Mayans introduced a new, unique character for every ${20}$ symbols, an
		example of a <span class="term">base-20 system</span>, or
		<span class="term">vigesimal system</span>. Moreover, like the ancient
		Egyptians, the Mayans understood the need to represent zero and assigned it
		a unique symbol &mdash; well before zero was accepted in Europe.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ancient China, whose characters made their way into the Korean peninsula and
		the Japanese isles, developed a number system from a mixture of pictographs
		and arithmetic. Unlike the Mayans and their connection to addition, the
		Chinese number system draws directly from multiplication and addition. By
		incorporating two arithmetic operators, the Chinese number system allowed
		for a smaller set of numerals, which in turn permitted efficient enumeration
		of large quantities.
	</p>
	<p>
		The numerals we use today are the
		<span class="term">Hindu-Arabic numerals</span>, derived from Hindu and
		Arabic number systems. Developed about ${2,000}$ years ago in India, the
		numerals made their way into Europe, via the Spanish peninsula. The Moors
		(Spanish Muslims), in their search for trade, brought both the Hindu-Arabic
		numerals and Ancient Greek philosophy, preserved by Arabic scholars. In the
		12th century, Leonardo Fibonacci, for whom the Fibonacci numbers are named,
		furthered the numerals spread into continental Europe. By the 15th century,
		the Roman numerals &mdash; until then the predominant symbols &mdash; were
		entirely replaced by the Hindu-Arabic numerals we know today.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of this is to say that there is a distinction between a
		<span class="italicsText">numeral</span> and a
		<span class="italicsText">number</span>. The numeral is purely a symbol. We
		could have just as easily continued using Roman symbols to do mathematics,
		just as medieval Europeans did. Understanding this distinction is crucial
		for when we study numbers. The Chinese symbol äº” is different from the
		Hindu-Arabic symbol ${5}$, but they both communicate the same idea &mdash;
		the number five. Often, we'll find that numerals are inappropriate for a
		particular analysis because of the underlying idea they communicate &mdash;
		a discrete number. In those situations, we must let go of the numeral
		abstraction, and think in different terms, different symbols, and different
		relationships. To do so effectively, we study the properties of the real
		numbers.

	<p>
		Let's cover some rudimentary rules and definitions about numbers. We will
		often revisit these topics over and over again, as numbers cannot be avoided
		in mathematics.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="integers">
	<h3>Integers</h3>
	<p>
		The <span class="term">integers</span> are the whole numbers we use for
		counting, and their opposities:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots $</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The numbers greater than ${0}$ are called the
		<span class="term">positive integers</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots $</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		And the numbers less than ${0}$ are called the
		<span class="term">negative integers</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The number ${0}$ is neither negative nor positive. It is both a
		<span class="term">nonpositive</span> and
		<span class="term">nonnegative</span> number. Thus, the nonpositive integers
		are the negative integers including ${0:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		and the <span class="italicsText">nonnegative integers</span> are the
		positive integers including 0:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$</p>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="naturals">
	<h3>The Natural Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		We define the <span class="term">natural numbers</span> as the positive
		integers including zero (i.e., the nonnegative integers):
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>${ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots}$</p>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Some texts define the natural numbers as the positive integers, and instead
		refer to the nonnegative integers as the
		<span class="term">whole numbers</span>. For reasons beyond the scope of the
		current discussion, defining the natural numbers as including zero has
		benefits for later sections.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="rationals">
	<h3>Rational Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		When we divide one integer by another nonzero integer, we get a
		<span class="term">rational number</span>. Specifically, if, and only if, a
		number can be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an integer and
		$b$ is a nonzero integer, then the number is a rational number. For example,
		4 is a rational number, since 4 can be written as $\frac{4}{1}$. 0.5 is a
		rational number, since it can be written as $\frac{1}{2}$.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="irrationals">
	<h3>Irrational Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		If a number cannot be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is an
		integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer, then the number is an
		<span class="term">irrational number</span>. For example, the number $\pi$
		is an irrational number, because it cannot be written in the form
		$\frac{a}{b}$.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="reals">
	<h3>Real Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		All of the numbers above are called
		<span class="term">real numbers</span>. In the simplest terms, a real number
		is a number that can be written as a decimal. Thus, 7 is a real number,
		since ${7 = 7.0.}$ Similarly, while ${\pi}$ is an irrational number. It is a
		real number since it can be written as a decimal (${3.14 \ldots}$), albeit
		non-terminating.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="complexes">
	<h3>Imaginary Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		Outside of the real numbers, we have the imaginary numbers. These are the
		numbers that result from operations such as $\sqrt{-1}$. We will treat and
		analyze this numbers in a separate chapter.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="decimalsystem">
	<h3>The Decimal System</h3>
	<p>
		Real numbers are written in
		<span class="term">decimal notation</span>. This is the prevailing standard
		(with the exception of <span class="term">binary</span>, favored by
		computers). The decimal system is useful because it allows us to quickly add
		numbers through the process of
		<span class="italicsText">carrying over</span>. For example:

<section id="laws_of_arithmetic">
	<h2>Laws of Arithmetic</h2>
	<p>
		The following materials discuss <span class="term">arithmetic</span>, the
		set of rules and conventions governing the manipulation of numbers. The word
		<span class="italicsText">arithmetic</span> is derived from the Greek
		<span class="italicsText">arithmetike</span>, meaning &#8220;art of
		counting,&#8221; which is itself derived from the Greek
		<span class="italicsText">arithmos,</span> meaning &#8220;number.&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>There are four basic arithmetic operators:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table>
			<thead>
				<th>Symbol</th>
				<th>Operation</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>$a + b$</td>
					<td>Addition</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a - b$</td>
					<td>Subtraction</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a \times b$</td>
					<td>Multiplication</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$\dfrac{a}{b}$</td>
					<td>Division</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$a^b$</td>
					<td>Exponentiation</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<figcaption>Basic operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Above, we used the letters $a$ and $b$. These are called
		<span class="term">variables</span>. They are simply placeholders that we
		can plug numbers, other variables, or even other operations with variables
		into. Variables allow us to <span class="term">generalize</span>, or
		<span class="term">abstract</span>, statements. For example, ${2 + 2 = 4}$,
		and ${3 + 8 = 11}$. We make an abstraction of this pattern, or idea, by
		writing something like ${a + b = n.}$ This communicates the idea, &#8220;The
		number ${n}$ is the sum of ${a}$ and ${b.}$&#8221;
		<span class="marginnote"
			>There are many ways to read an equation, but they all express the same
			idea. The human mind, however, is a peculiar thing. Often, reading and
			writing the same equation in different ways can lead to drastically
			different insights. Consider all the different ways we can read ${a + b =
			n:}$ The sum of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is ${n.}$ The number ${n}$ is the sum of
			${a}$ and ${b.}$ The numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ such that the sum is ${n.}$
			The number ${b}$ is the difference of ${n}$ and ${a.}$</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Abstractions are useful because they allow us greater flexibility and
		accuracy with our statements. Suppose we want to say, "I'm looking for two
		numbers that add to 10." We can write: $a + b = 10$. This flexibility and
		accuracy is a powerful tool in mathematics, because it gives us plenty of
		room to write statements that say what we can and cannot do &mdash; rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Understanding the basic rules of arithmetic at a very high level is
		priceless in mathematics. Part of the elegance and power of mathematics is
		that we can arrive at beautiful, and often shocking, results from a set of
		very basic rules.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="laws_of_addition">
	<h3>Laws of Addition</h3>
	<p>
		Addition can be thought of as moving to the right along the real number line
		by whatever number we are adding. So, for example, the expression $4 + 2$
		can be thought of as "Start at 4, and move 2 to the right." This give us the
		final destination of 6. Subtraction is really just addition, only instead of
		moving towards the right, we move towards the left. For example, $4 - 3$ is
		really $4 + (-3)$, returning 1. Visually:

	<section id="identity_property_of_addition">
		<h4>Identity Property of Addition</h4>
		<p>
			Pius, a bank robber, goes to Ultimate Safety Bank, and robs it. He leaves
			with 4,000 dollars. Pius then goes to another bank Safer Bank, 4,000
			dollars and fake gun in hand, and tells the teller to put the money in the
			bag. The teller takes the bag, disappears below the counter, and pretends
			to place money in the bag; the teller, in fact, didn't place anything in
			the bag. She returns the bag, and Pius sprints out the building to his
			e-scooter, and zooms away. He gets home and opens the bag. How much money
			does Pius have?
		</p>
		<p>
			Pius starts with 0, then takes 4,000 from Ultimate Safety, then goes to
			Safer Bank, and gets 0. When we add 0 to a number, we are effectively
			saying "no movement" along the number line. Thus, we have the following
			rule:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Identity Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a
					\in \R,}$ then:
				</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${a + 0 = 0 + a = a}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</section>

	<section id="adding_negative_and_positive_numbers">
		<h4>Subtraction</h4>
		<p>
			Knowing whether operands are negative or positive can allow us to
			immediately conclude certain propositions. First, the sum of two positive
			integers is a positive integer.
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Property.</span> If ${a, b \in \Z^{+},}$ then ${a
					+ b \in \Z^{+}.}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			From the rule property above, we have a further property: The sum of two
			negative numbers is a negative number.
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Definition.</span> If ${a, b \in \Z^{-},}$ then
					${a + b \in \Z^{-}.}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The operation of subtraction is not exactly an independent operation.
			Really, subtraction is just addition with a negative. The
			&#8220;operation&#8221; of subtraction is really just a shorthand way for
			writing out addition of positive and negative numbers. For example, when
			we write ${a + (-b),}$< we instead just write ${a - b.}$ It's just a
			faster way of writing the same expression.
		</p>
		<p>
			The identity property of addition leads to the additive inverse. As
			aforementioned, subtraction is really just adding negative numbers.
			Considering the addition with zero rule, we have the following inference:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Additive Inverse.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Given the equation ${a + (-a) = 0}$, we say that ${-a}$ is the
			<span class="term">additive inverse</span> of ${a.}$ Whenever we see the
			equation ${-a + a = 0}$, we should immediately become aware that we ${a}$
			and ${-a}$ are on opposite sides of 0 on the real line. Furthermore,
			because ${-a + a = 0}$, subtracting ${-a}$ from both sides, we have ${-a =
			-(-a)}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			The additive inverse also allows us to draw another inference. Given the
			equation ${a + x = a,}$ we should immediately know that ${x = 0.}$
			Similary, if we see the equation ${a + x = 0,}$ then we should immediately
			know that ${x = -a.}$
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="commutative_property_of_addition">
		<h4>Commutative Property of Addition</h4>
		<p>Say we have The commutative law of addition states that:</p>
		<figure class="display-math">
			<div>
				<p>$a + b = b + a$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			In other words, the order of terms in addition does not change the sum of
			those terms. We call the property above more generally as
			<span class="term">commutativity.</span> One way to remember it is
			&#8220;In addition, terms can
			<span class="italicsText">commute</span>.&#8221; In other words, the terms
			can move around as they please, as long as they stay within addition (and
			as we'll see later, multiplication).
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea is made apparent from a simple analogy. If we want sweet iced
			tea, we can: add the tea, then the ice, then the sugar; or we can add the
			sugar, then the ice, then the tea; or we can add the tea, then the sugar,
			then the ice, and so on and so forth. Either or, the result is the same
			&mdash; sweet iced tea.

				made.</span
			>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="associative_property_of_addition">
		<h4>Associative Law of Addition</h4>
		<p>
			The associative law of addition states that the sum of the terms does not
			depend on the grouping of the terms. In other words, we can group the
			terms however way we'd like.
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Associative Property of Addition.</span> Given
					${a, b, c \in \R,}$ then:
				</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We call the property above more generally as
			<span class="term">associativity</span>. We can remember it as, &#8220;In
			addition, the terms are free to
			<span class="italicsText">associate</span>.&#8221; In other words, the
			terms can gather together or separate as they please, as long as they stay
			within addition (and again, as we'll see later, multiplication).
		</p>
		<p>
			From the definition above, if we have the expression ${a + b + c + d,}$ we
			can generate numerous different possibilities:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a + b + c + d}$</p>
				<p>${((a + b) + c) + d}$</p>
				<p>${a + ((b + c) + d)}$</p>
				<p>${a + (b + (c + d))}$</p>
				<p>${(a + b) + (c + d)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			All these possibilities are equivalent, but some may be easier to compute
			than others.
		</p>
		<p>The associative law of addition leads to another useful property:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p>If $a + b = 0$, then $b = -a$ and $a = -b$.</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The above property is the direct result of subtracting either $a$ or $b$
			from both sides. Associativity and commutativity are what allow us to
			rewrite expressions in numerous different ways:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>$(a - b) + c = (a + (-b)) + c$</p>
				<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (-b + c)$ by associativity</p>
				<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (c - b)$ by commutativity</p>
				<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = (a + c) - b$ by associativity</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Importantly, the associative property of addition
			<span class="underlineText">does not apply</span> to subtraction. For
			example, ${a - b}$ does not imply that ${b - a.}$ ${a - b}$ is equivalent
			to ${a + (-b),}$ but it is not equivalent to ${b + (-a).}$ The proposition
			${a - b = b - a}$ is true iff ${a = b.}$
		</p>
	</section>

	<section id="even_odd_rule">
		<h4>Even-Odd Signage Rule</h4>
		<p>Given that $a + (-a) = 0$, we can draw yet another inference:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>$a = -(-a)$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Notice that the number of minus signs is even. If we add another minus
			sign:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>$-(-(-a)) = -(a) = -a$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Thus, we can make yet another inference:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>
					Let $a$ be a positive real number, and $x$ be $a$ preceded by $n$
					minus signs, where $n$ is an integer. If $n$ is even, then $x$ is
					positive (i.e., $a$). If $n$ is odd, then $x$ is negative (i.e.,
					$-a$).
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The even-odd signage rule really can be thought of as the arithmetic
			equivalent of double-negatives. The rule is what allows us to rewrite
			expressions:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${-(a + b) = - a - b}$</p>
				<p>${a + b = - (- a - b)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</section>

	<section id="three_number_relationships">
		<h4>3-Number Relationships</h4>
		<p>Suppose we know the following relationship:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${ a + b = c }$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Three number relationships are ripe for inferences. If we add ${ -b }$ to
			both sides of the equation, we obtain ${ a + b - b = c - b }$.

					<p>What we know:</p>

						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						How many 8s do we need to arrive at a sum where the last digit is 0?
						At least five 8s, since $8 \times 5 = 40$. Thus, we have:

					<figure>
						$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\

					</figure>
					<p>
						Now note that there is a 4 that must be carried to the next place.
						To keep the sum's digits 0, we need a sum of 8s and a 4 that returns

	<h2>Distributivity</h2>
	<p>
		With the rules thus far, we can make even further inferences. We know that,
		if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then ${ a = -b }$ and ${ b = -a }$. Thus, if ${ a + b =
		0 }$, then it must be true that ${ (a + b) + (-a - b) = 0 }$, since ${ a + b
		= 0 }$ and ${ -a - b = 0 }$. If ${ (a + b) + (-a-b) = 0 }$, then it follows
		that ${ a + b - a -b = 0 }$. Rearranging the equation, we have ${ a - a + b
		- b = 0 }$. Rearranging again, we have: ${ -(a + b) = -a + (-b) }$. This
		yields the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ -(a + b) = -a - b }$.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We know this rule as the
		<span class="term">distributive law</span>. Note that we should always be
		vigilant about distributing a minus sign to a sum involving negative
		numbers: ${ -(-a) = a }$. To ensure that vigilance, we should make the
		following rules clear:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are positive integers, then ${ a + b }$ is a
				positive integer.
			</p>
			<p>
				If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are negative integers, then ${ a + b }$ is a
				negative integer.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can see that these rules are true with a simple proof. Let ${ a = -n }$
		and ${ b = -m }$, where ${ m }$ and ${ n }$ are positive. It follows then
		that ${ a + b = -n - m = -(n + m) }$. Since ${ n }$ and ${ m }$ are
		positive, ${ n + m }$ is positive. Since ${ n + m }$ is positive, it follows
		that ${ a + b }$ is negative, because ${ n + m }$ is positive only if ${ a +
		b }$ is negative.

		From the property above, we say that the natural numbers are

		In other words, if we add two natural numbers, then the sum is a natural

	<p>
		From the property above, we can draw a few other useful properties. First,
		because we define the natural numbers as including 0, the set of natural
		numbers is a superset of the positive integers. Accordingly:

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">

		In other words, the set of positive integers is closed under addition and

		Notice that both the even integers and the odd integers increment by 2. The
		difference, however, is that the even integers start at 2, and the odd
		integers start at 1. A number's property of odd-ness or even-ness is called
		the number's <span class="term">parity</span>. Note that parity is a
		property held only by the positive integers. The negative integers are
		neither even nor odd. We can abstract this idea with algebra: An even
		integer is an integer that can be written as ${2k,}$ where ${k}$ is a
		positive integer. Denoting the set of even integers with the symbol
		${\Z_{\text{even}},}$ and the set of positive integers with the symbol
		${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ we can define an even integer more formally as:

				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is even if, and only if, it can be written in the

		</div>

	<p>For the odd integers, we write:</p>

				I.e., an integer ${x}$ is odd if, and only if, it can be written in the

	<p>
		The only meaningful difference between the first and second definition is
		whether ${k}$ is a natural number or a positive integer. In other words,
		whether ${k}$ can be 0. If ${k}$ can be 0, then we must change the
		definition from ${2k - 1}$ to ${2k + 1,}$ because if ${k = 0,}$ then ${2k -
		1 = -1.}$ ${-1}$ is neither odd nor even, because parity is a property that
		applies only to positive integers (0 is also neither odd nor even).

	<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Prove the theorem above.</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proof (by direct proof).</span> Given ${a \in
			\Z^{+},}$ there are two hypotheses to be proved:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

				<p>If ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even.</p>
				<p>If ${a}$ is odd, then ${a^2}$ is odd.</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We prove each hypothesis in turn, beginning with the first hypothesis.
			Suppose ${a \in \Z_{\text{even}}.}$ Since ${a}$ is an even integer, then
			by definition, ${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n,}$ where ${n}$
			is a positive integer. By substitution:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n)^2}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the definition of an exponent:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n)(2n)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>By the associative property of multiplication:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		</figure>
		<p>By the definition of an exponent:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2)(2n^2)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because the product of positive integer is a positive integer, the intger
			${2n^2}$ is a positive integer. Hence:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2m}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${m}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2m}$ is an even integer by
			definition, ${a^2}$ is even.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, we consider the second hypothesis. Suppose ${a \in
			\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ Given that ${a}$ is an odd integer, then by definition,
			${a}$ is a positive integer of the form ${2n + 1,}$ where ${n}$ is a
			positive integer. By substitution:

		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = (2n + 1)^2}$</p>

		<p>By expansion:</p>

		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2(2n^2 + 2n) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Because ${n}$ is a positive integer, ${2n^2 + 2n}$ is a positive integer.
			Hence:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${a^2 = 2k + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${k}$ is a positive integer. Because ${2k + 1}$ is an odd integer by
			definition, ${a^2}$ is odd.

	<p>The theorem above yields a corollary:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Corollary.</span> Let ${a \in \Z^{+}.}$ Then:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{even}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{even}}}$</p>
					<p>${a^2 \in \Z_{\text{odd}} \implies a \in \Z_{\text{odd}}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		As with many corollaries, the propositions above are implied by the previous
		theorem. If ${a^2}$ is even, then ${a}$ must be even, for if ${a}$ is odd,
		then ${a^2}$ is odd. Similarly, if ${a^2}$ is odd, then ${a}$ must be odd,
		for if ${a}$ is even, then ${a^2}$ is even. This is a straightforward
		example of logical contradiction.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is from parity that we generalize the concept of
		<span class="term">divisibility</span>. Suppose ${a}$ is a positive integer
		and ${b}$ is an integer. When we say that ${b}$ is divisible by ${a,}$ we
		mean that ${a}$ divides ${b.}$ We denote this proposition with the notation
		${a \space\vert\space b.}$ An integer ${b}$ is divisible by ${a}$ if, and
		only if, ${b = an,}$ where ${n}$ is some integer.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${a \in \Z^{+}}$ and ${b \in
				\Z.}$ Then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">

					<p>${a \space\vert\space b \iff b = an}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>where ${n \in \Z.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The definition above yields several useful propositions:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>Every integer is divisible by 1.</li>
			<li>Every positive integer is divisible by itself.</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first proposition is implied by the fact that every integer can be
		written as ${n = (1)(n).}$ This in turn implies the second proposition.
	</p>

	<h3>Composites & Primes</h3>
	<figure style="margin: 5% 0">
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/compound_prime.svg' %}"
			alt="compound numbers, prime numbers"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From the definition above, there are two subsets within the natural numbers.
		Any natural number that can be grouped into a solid rectangle is called a
		<span class="term">composite number</span> (also called
		<span class="italicsText">compound numbers</span>). More formally:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">composite number</span> ${k}$ is a natural
				number greater than 1, divisible by some positive integer ${n,}$ where
				${n \neq 1.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The negation of this definition yields the
		<span class="term">prime numbers</span>, numbers that
		<span class="underlineText">cannot</span> be grouped into a solid rectangle.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">prime number</span> ${m}$ is a natural number
				greater than 1, divisible only by 1 and itself.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note that from the definitions above, we see that the numbers 0 and 1 have a
		special property: Both 0 and 1 are neither prime nor compound.
	</p>

	<h3>Division & Rational Numbers</h3>
	<p>
		The operation of division is closely tied to the
		<span class="term">rational numbers</span>. A rational number is any number
		that can be written in the form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{m}{n}}$ or ${m/n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers, and ${n \neq 0.}$ The last condition is
		crucial, because in this particular world (classical algebra),
		<span class="underlineText">we cannot divide by 0.</span> The rational
		numbers come in various forms:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\ldots, \dfrac{1}{3}, - \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{2}{3}, 1.4, 0.08, 12.0,
				0.0, \ldots}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The rule is, as long as a number can be written as ${m/n,}$ where ${m, n}$
		are integers and ${n \neq 0,}$ then the number is rational number.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>In computer science, the rational numbers are called
			<span class="term">floats</span> or
			<span class="term">floating point numbers</span> (the decimal point
			&#8220;floats&#8221; as needed).</span
		>
		Otherwise, the number is an irrational number. Note what this definition
		means. Every integer satisfies the definition rational number definition, so
		we say that the rational numbers are a proper superset of the integers.
		I.e., every integer is a rational number, but not every rational number is
		an integer.

	<h3>The Division Algorithm</h3>
	<p>Among the operations, division is the most complicated.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise</span>. A six-digit number having 1 as its
		leftmost digit becomes three times bigger if we take this digit off and put
		it at the end of the number. What is this number?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>Let the number be $1ABCDE$.</p>
		<p>Then, $ABCDE1 = 3 \times 1ABCDE$.</p>
		<p>Rewrite this with the multiplication algorithm:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{array}{cc} & A & B & C & D & E \\ \times & & & & & 3 \\ \hline A
			& B & C & D & E & 1 \end{array} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Let's focus on $E$. We need a digit $E$ where $3 \times E = n1$, where $n$
			is a digit. This digit must be 7, for $7 \times 3 = 21$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that $E$ is 7, so what might $D$ be? Well, we need a digit $D$
			where $(D \times 3) + 2 = 7$. Or, rearranging, $D \times 3 = 5$. The only
			digit that would satisfy this condition is $D = 5$ (since $3 \times 5 + 2
			= 17$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We know that $D$ is 5, so now we look at $C$. We need a digit $C$ such
			that $(C \times 3) + 1 = 5$, or, rearranging, $C \times 3 = 4$. There is
			only one digit that satisfies this condition, 8. Thus, $C = 8$.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we look at $B$. What digit satisfies the condition $B \times 3 = 6$?
			It must be 2. Therefore, $B = 2$.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we look at $A$. What digit results in $A \times 3 = 12$. It must
			be 4, since $3 \times 4 = 12$. Hence, the digits are $A = 4$, $B = 2$, $C
			= 8$, and $D = 5$.

	<h2>Order of Operations</h2>
	<p>
		Arithmetic allows us to combine numbers, through the operations listed
		above, to form other numbers. The way we order operations matters in
		mathematics. Otherwise, we run into problems. For example, consider the
		following:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<p>$2 + 3 \times 4$</p>
		<figcaption>Multiple operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What does this expression mean? Well, it could be: (1) Add 2 and 3, then (2)
		multiply the sum by 4. Or, it could mean: (1) Multiply 3 and 4, and (2) add
		2 to the product. This ambiguity is unacceptable in mathematics. We need be
		clear and precise with our words. For these reason, mathematics follows a
		few conventions on how to write mathematical expressions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Evaluate expressions in parentheses first, working from the inner most
				to the outer most, applying all of these rules.
			</li>
			<li>Perform all exponentiations.</li>
			<li>Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.</li>
			<li>Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.</li>
		</ol>
		<figcaption>The order of operations</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The conventions above are collectively called the
		<span class="term">order of operations</span>. Again, these are conventions.
		They are not universal truths; they're simply what mathematicians have come
		to agree to about how mathematics is communicated and understood.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Operations as Trees.</span> One way to think about the
		order of operations is that it is a way for us to distinguish between
		different "trees" (the diagrams below are called
		<span class="term">binary trees</span>, to be covered in further detail in
		later sections). For example, suppose we had the following expression:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2 \times 4 + 6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Without the order of operations, the expression above could be $(2 \times
		4)+6$, which can be visualized as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/orderOperations_binaryTree1.svg' %}"
			alt="binary tree"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>Or, it could be $2 \times (4+6)$:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/orderOperations_binaryTree2.svg' %}"
			alt="binary tree"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The order of operations tells us that we perform additions and subtractions
		from left to right, so the "correct" tree is $(2 \times 4) + 6$, the first
		tree. Really, the order of operations is governed by one rule, evaluate
		expressions inside the parentheses first, and the remaining rules tell us
		<span class="italicsText">where</span> to place parentheses when they are
		absent. The parentheses, in turn, allow us to distinguish between different
		<span class="italicsText">trees</span>.
