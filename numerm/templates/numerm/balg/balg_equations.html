<h1>Expressions & Equations</h1>

<section id="expressions">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">I</span>n algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$
		${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent numbers. We call such letters
		<span class="term">variables</span>. When we combine these variables with
		mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., we
		have an <span class="term">expression</span>. For example, the following are
		all expressions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${a + 2}$</p>
			<p>${x^2}$</p>
			<p>${\sqrt{x} - y}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{x^{1/3} + x^2}{a/b}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an
		<span class="term">equation</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In mathematics, the equal sign is a symbol that expresses the
		<span class="term">relation</span> between mathematical objects. In the
		example above above, these objects are expressions. When we place an equal
		sign between two expressions, we are saying: The expression ${a^2 + b^2}$ is
		the same, in every way, as the expression ${c^2.}$ This is a proposition.
		Notice its gravity. There are very few things in the world that have that
		property &mdash; the same in <span class="underlineText">every</span> way.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will see in later sections that equality is just one kind of relation. In
		fact, a significant portion of mathematics (if not most) concerns
		<span class="term">inequations</span> &mdash; propositions like ${x^2 <
		y^2.}$ We will revisit inequations (also called
		<span class="italicsText">inequalities</span>) once we've established
		familiarity with equations.
	</p>

<section id="kinds_of_equations">
	<h2>Families of Equations</h2>
	<p>
		Equations fall into several types. Mathematicians have constructed these
		groupings because equations often share many properties. We will explore
		what these properties are carefully, but before doing so, we have some
		familiarity of the type names. The overview provided below is strictly
		informal. We will provide more formal definitions when we address each type
		of equation in turn.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Linear Equations</span>
		The linear equation is the simplest equation. Here are some examples of
		linear equations:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${12x - 2 = 0}$</p>
			<p>${19x = 24}$</p>
			<p>${17x + 4y = z}$</p>
			<p>${ax + by + nz = g}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that the number of variables doesn't prevent an equation from being
		classified as a linear equation. Indeed, the only requirements for something
		to be a linear equation is that each term is either a constant or the
		product of a constant and a single variable. If the linear equation consists
		of just one variable, we say that the equation is a
		<span class="italicsText">linear equation of one-variable</span>. If there
		are two variables, it's a
		<span class="italicsText">linear equation of two-variables</span>, and so
		on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite their simplicity, linear equations are extremely important in both
		pure and applied mathematics. In physics, the distance an object travels,
		called <span class="term">displacement</span>, is given by a linear
		equation: ${s = x_f - x_i,}$ where ${s}$ is the displacement, ${x_f}$ is the
		final position, and ${x_i}$ is the initial position. The final velocity of
		an object can also be determined by the equation ${v_f = v_0 + at,}$ where
		${v_f}$ is the final velocity, ${v_0}$ is the initial velocity, ${a}$ is the
		acceleration, and ${t}$ is the time interval. These are both linear
		equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Polynomial Equations</span>
		Polynomial equations are equations consisting of
		<span class="term">polynomials</span> &mdash; expressions that consist of
		variables and coefficients where the onperations involved are addition,
		subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation. This
		is a bit of a mouthful, so here are some examples of polynomial expressions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${x^2 - 4x + 13}$</p>
			<p>${x^2 + y^2}$</p>
			<p>${bx^3}$</p>
			<p>${2x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>and here are some examples of polynomial equations:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$</p>
			<p>${\Delta x = v_0t + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2}$</p>
			<p>${3x^2 - 9 = 0}$</p>
			<p>${2x - 1 = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Wait a minute. Isn't that ${2x - 1 = 0}$ a linear equation? It is in fact a
		linear equation. All linear equations are
		<span class="term">polynomial equations of degree-1</span>. But, not every
		polynomial equation is a linear equation. For example, a
		<span class="term">polynomial equation of degree-2</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ax^2 + x + c = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Put simply, the <span class="term">degree</span> of a polynomial equation is
		the leading exponent in the equation. A
		<span class="term">polynomial equation of degree-3</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because it's fairly cumbersome to write &#8220;of degree-${n}$&#8221; every
		time, we have some special names for certain degrees. A
		<span class="term">quadratic equation</span> is a polynomial equation of
		degree-2. For example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${3x^2 + x - 9 = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A
		<span class="term">cubic equation</span> is a polynomial equation of
		degree-3:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${4x^3 - x = 12}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A
		<span class="term">quartic equation</span> is a polynomial equation of
		degree-4:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${x^4 + 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 12 = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Quartic equations are sometimes called
		<span class="term">biquadratic equations</span>. We use the term quartic
		because it's shorter to write.
	</p>
	<p>
		Polynomial equations are also classified by the number of terms the equation
		contains. A polynomial equation with only one term is called a
		<span class="term">monomial</span>. For example, ${x^2 = 0}$ is a monomial
		equation. A polynomial equation with two terms is called a
		<span class="term">binomial</span>. For example, ${a^2 + b^2 = 2}$ is a
		binomial equation. A polynomial equation with three terms is called a
		<span class="term">trinomial</span> &mdash; ${a^2 + b + c = 0.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Trigonometric Equations</span>
		Many equations represent cycles, and wherever there are cycles, there's
		likely a trigonometric operator involved. Such equations are called
		<span class="term">trigonometric equations</span>. These equations might
		look something like:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\sin x + \cos y = z}$</p>
			<p>${(\tan^2 x + 5) - \sin x = 0}$</p>
			<p>${\arctan z - y^2 = x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Exponential Equations</span>
		<span class="term">Exponential equations</span> look very much like
		polynomials, with the distinctive feature that their exponents have
		variables instead. For example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${y = e^x}$</p>
			<p>${z = y^x - 24}$</p>
			<p>${2^a + c = b^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Exponential equations are often seen in mathematical models for population
		growth and areas of finance.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Radical Equations</span>
		<span class="term">Radical equations</span> have the distinctive feature of
		containing one or more <span class="italicsText">radicands</span> or
		fractional exponents:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${y = \sqrt{x}}$</p>
			<p>${a = b^{1/2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Rational Equations.</span> Finally, we have the
		<span class="term">rational equations</span>. These are equations with
		rational expressions or negative exponents:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{x}{4} = \dfrac{(y - 3)^2}{17}}$</p>
			<p>${y = \dfrac{1}{x}}$</p>
			<p>${f = n^{-1}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<h2>Truth Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Because expressions contain variables, an equation is true or false if, and
		only if, we substitute values into those variables. Until then, an equation
		is neither true nor false. If a value is inputted and the equation is true,
		we call that value the <span class="term">solution</span>, or
		<span class="term">root</span>, of the equation. The set of all roots to an
		equation is called the equation's <span class="term">truth set</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identities.</span> If an equation's truth set is the
		equation's domain, we say that equation is an
		<span class="term">identity</span>. For example, the equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
		substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations true.
	</p>

	<h2>Conditional Equations</h2>
	<p>
		The opposite of an identity is a
		<span class="term">conditional equation</span>. These are equations that are
		true <span class="italicsText">only if</span> some condition(s) is/are true.
		For example, the following are conditional equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${x = x + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The equation
		$x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one more than
		itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation can never
		be true).
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equivalent Equations.</span> Equivalent expressions are
		represented by expressions. Equations themselves can be equivalent. Two
		equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have exactly the same
		solutions.
	</p>

	<h2>Linear Equations in One Variable</h2>
	<p>
		Because equations often share properties, they can be classified into
		various kinds. One such kind is a
		<span class="term">linear equation in one variable</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A linear equation in one variable
				is an equation that can be written in the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ax + b = 0}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, all of the equations below are one-variable linear equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${5x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${2m + 3 = 19}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{3} = \dfrac{y}{5} + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Domain of an Expression.</span> All mathematical
		expressions have a <span class="term">domain</span> &mdash; the set of all
		values for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
		expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
		example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
		debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
		economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
		the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
		is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
		notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of
		$\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?
	</p>

	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			$dom(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
			-3\}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
			the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.
		</p>
	</details>

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>${4x + 3x^{-1} = 4x + \dfrac{3}{x}.}$</p>
		<p>${dom(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}.}$</p>
	</details>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Polynomial Equations</h2>
	<p>
		All linear equations are instances of
		<span class="term">polynomial equations</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span>
				A
				<span class="term">one-variable polynomial equation</span> is an

			</figure>
			<p>
				where ${a}$ is a constant and the exponents are nonnegative integers.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		If ${ a_n \neq 0}$, then the <span class="term">degree</span> of the
		polynomial equation is the largest exponent accompanying a variable in the
		equation. For example, the 1-variable polynomial equation ${ 4x^2 - 5x - 1 =
		0 }$ is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 2, and the equation ${
		3x^5 - 2x^2 + 9 = 0 }$ is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 5.
	</p>

	<p>
		A 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 1 is a
		<span class="italicsText">linear equation</span>. A 1-variable polynomial
		equation of degree 2 is a
		<span class="italicsText">quadratic equation</span>.
	</p>

	<h3>Inequalities</h3>

	<p>
		Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than
		equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine
		whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in
		comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal
		sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$
		we obtain an <span class="term">inequality</span>. Both equations and
		inequalities are mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like
		equations, have truth sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the
		inequality true if any member of that set is substituted into a variable, or
		variables, of the inequality.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member
		of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x =
		10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 =
		17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by
		solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
			<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
			<p>
				&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}
				\mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for
		equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling.
		Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides
		of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$
		If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 <
		30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we
		would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation
		returns 2 general rules:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul>
			<li>
				If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive
				real number, then the inequality is preserved.
			</li>
			<li>
				If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative
				real number, then the inequality is reversed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>More explicit rules:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>
		</ol>
