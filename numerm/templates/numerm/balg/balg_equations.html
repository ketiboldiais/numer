<h1>Expressions & Equations</h1>
<section id="expressions">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">I</span>n algebra, we use letters like ${x,}$ ${y,}$
		${n,}$ and ${m}$ to represent numbers. We call such letters
		<b>variables</b>. When we combine these variables with mathematical
		operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., we have an
		<b>expression</b>. For example, the following are all expressions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${a + 2}$</p>
			<p>${x^2}$</p>
			<p>${\sqrt{x} - y}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{x^{1/3} + x^2}{a/b}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we place an equal sign between two expressions, we have an
		<b>equation</b>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In mathematics, the equal sign is a symbol that expresses the
		<b>relation</b> between mathematical objects. In the example above above,
		these objects are expressions. When we place an equal sign between two
		expressions, we are saying: The expression ${a^2 + b^2}$ is the same, in
		every way, as the expression ${c^2.}$ This is a proposition. Notice its
		gravity. There are very few things in the world that have that property
		&mdash; the same in every way.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will see in later sections that equality is just one kind of relation. In
		fact, a significant portion of mathematics (if not most) concerns
		<b>inequations</b> &mdash; propositions like ${x^2 < y^2.}$ We will revisit
		inequations (also called <i>inequalities</i>) once we've established
		familiarity with equations.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="kinds_of_equations">
	<h2>Families of Equations</h2>
	<p>
		Equations fall into several types. Mathematicians have constructed these
		groupings because equations often share many properties. We will explore
		what these properties are carefully, but before doing so, we have some
		familiarity of the type names. The overview provided below is strictly
		informal. We will provide more formal definitions when we address each type
		of equation in turn.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Linear Equations</span>
		The linear equation is the simplest equation. Here are some examples of
		linear equations:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${12x - 2 = 0}$</p>
			<p>${19x = 24}$</p>
			<p>${17x + 4y = z}$</p>
			<p>${ax + by + nz = g}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that the number of variables doesn't prevent an equation from being
		classified as a linear equation. Indeed, the only requirements for something
		to be a linear equation is that each term is either a constant or the
		product of a constant and a single variable. If the linear equation consists
		of just one variable, we say that the equation is a
		<i>linear equation of one-variable</i>. If there are two variables, it's a
		<i>linear equation of two-variables</i>, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite their simplicity, linear equations are extremely important in both
		pure and applied mathematics. In physics, the distance an object travels,
		called <b>displacement</b>, is given by a linear equation: ${s = x_f -
		x_i,}$ where ${s}$ is the displacement, ${x_f}$ is the final position, and
		${x_i}$ is the initial position. The final velocity of an object can also be
		determined by the equation ${v_f = v_0 + at,}$ where ${v_f}$ is the final
		velocity, ${v_0}$ is the initial velocity, ${a}$ is the acceleration, and
		${t}$ is the time interval. These are both linear equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Polynomial Equations</span>
		Polynomial equations are equations consisting of
		<b>polynomials</b> &mdash; expressions that consist of variables and
		coefficients where the onperations involved are addition, subtraction,
		multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation. This is a bit of a
		mouthful, so here are some examples of polynomial expressions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${x^2 - 4x + 13}$</p>
			<p>${x^2 + y^2}$</p>
			<p>${bx^3}$</p>
			<p>${2x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>and here are some examples of polynomial equations:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$</p>
			<p>${\Delta x = v_0t + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2}$</p>
			<p>${3x^2 - 9 = 0}$</p>
			<p>${2x - 1 = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Wait a minute. Isn't that ${2x - 1 = 0}$ a linear equation? It is in fact a
		linear equation. All linear equations are
		<b>polynomial equations of degree-1</b>. But, not every polynomial equation
		is a linear equation. For example, a <b>polynomial equation of degree-2</b>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${ax^2 + x + c = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Put simply, the <b>degree</b> of a polynomial equation is the leading
		exponent in the equation. A <b>polynomial equation of degree-3</b>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because it's fairly cumbersome to write &#8220;of degree-${n}$&#8221; every
		time, we have some special names for certain degrees. A
		<b>quadratic equation</b> is a polynomial equation of degree-2. For example:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${3x^2 + x - 9 = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A
		<b>cubic equation</b> is a polynomial equation of degree-3:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${4x^3 - x = 12}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A
		<b>quartic equation</b> is a polynomial equation of degree-4:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${x^4 + 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 12 = 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Quartic equations are sometimes called
		<b>biquadratic equations</b>. We use the term quartic because it's shorter
		to write.
	</p>
	<p>
		Polynomial equations are also classified by the number of terms the equation
		contains. A polynomial equation with only one term is called a
		<b>monomial</b>. For example, ${x^2 = 0}$ is a monomial equation. A
		polynomial equation with two terms is called a <b>binomial</b>. For example,
		${a^2 + b^2 = 2}$ is a binomial equation. A polynomial equation with three
		terms is called a <b>trinomial</b> &mdash; ${a^2 + b + c = 0.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Trigonometric Equations</span>
		Many equations represent cycles, and wherever there are cycles, there's
		likely a trigonometric operator involved. Such equations are called
		<b>trigonometric equations</b>. These equations might look something like:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\sin x + \cos y = z}$</p>
			<p>${(\tan^2 x + 5) - \sin x = 0}$</p>
			<p>${\arctan z - y^2 = x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Exponential Equations</span>
		<b>Exponential equations</b> look very much like polynomials, with the
		distinctive feature that their exponents have variables instead. For
		example:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${y = e^x}$</p>
			<p>${z = y^x - 24}$</p>
			<p>${2^a + c = b^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Exponential equations are often seen in mathematical models for population
		growth and areas of finance.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Radical Equations</span>
		<b>Radical equations</b> have the distinctive feature of containing one or
		more <i>radicands</i> or fractional exponents:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${y = \sqrt{x}}$</p>
			<p>${a = b^{1/2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Rational Equations.</span> Finally, we have the
		<b>rational equations</b>. These are equations with rational expressions or
		negative exponents:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{x}{4} = \dfrac{(y - 3)^2}{17}}$</p>
			<p>${y = \dfrac{1}{x}}$</p>
			<p>${f = n^{-1}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="truth_sets">
	<h2>Truth Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Because expressions contain variables, an equation is true or false if, and
		only if, we substitute values into those variables. Until then, an equation
		is neither true nor false. If a value is inputted and the equation is true,
		we call that value the <b>solution</b>, or <b>root</b>, of the equation. The
		set of all roots to an equation is called the equation's <b>truth set</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identities.</span> If an equation's truth set is the
		equation's domain, we say that equation is an <b>identity</b>. For example,
		the equations:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
		substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations true.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="conditional_equations">
	<h2>Conditional Equations</h2>
	<p>
		The opposite of an identity is a
		<b>conditional equation</b>. These are equations that are true
		<i>only if</i> some condition(s) is/are true. For example, the following are
		conditional equations:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${2x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${x = x + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The equation
		$x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one more than
		itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation can never
		be true).
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equivalent Equations.</span> Equivalent expressions are
		represented by expressions. Equations themselves can be equivalent. Two
		equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have exactly the same
		solutions.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="linear_equations_in_one_variable">
	<h2>Linear Equations in One Variable</h2>
	<p>
		Because equations often share properties, they can be classified into
		various kinds. One such kind is a
		<b>linear equation in one variable</b>.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A linear equation in one variable
				is an equation that can be written in the form:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${ax + b = 0}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, all of the equations below are one-variable linear equations:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${5x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${2m + 3 = 19}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{3} = \dfrac{y}{5} + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="domain_of_an_expression">
	<h2>The Domain of an Expression</h2>
	<p>
		All mathematical expressions have a <b>domain</b> &mdash; the set of all
		values for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
		expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
		example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
		debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
		economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
		the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
		is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
		notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of
		$\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			$dom(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
			-3\}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
			the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.
		</p>
	</details>
	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>${4x + 3x^{-1} = 4x + \dfrac{3}{x}.}$</p>
		<p>${dom(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}.}$</p>
	</details>
</section>

<section id="polynomial_equations">
	<h2>Polynomial Equations</h2>
	<p>
		All linear equations are instances of
		<b>polynomial equations</b>.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span>
				A
				<b>one-variable polynomial equation</b> is an equation of the form:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${ a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1}x + a_0 = 0 }$</p>

			<p>
				where ${a}$ is a constant and the exponents are nonnegative integers.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If ${ a_n \neq 0}$, then the <b>degree</b> of the polynomial equation is the
		largest exponent accompanying a variable in the equation. For example, the
		1-variable polynomial equation ${ 4x^2 - 5x - 1 = 0 }$ is a 1-variable
		polynomial equation of degree 2, and the equation ${ 3x^5 - 2x^2 + 9 = 0 }$
		is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 5.
	</p>
	<p>
		A 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 1 is a
		<i>linear equation</i>. A 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 2 is a
		<i>quadratic equation</i>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="inequalities">
	<h2>Inequalities</h2>
	<p>
		Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than
		equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine
		whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in
		comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal
		sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$
		we obtain an <b>inequality</b>. Both equations and inequalities are
		mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like equations, have truth
		sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the inequality true if any
		member of that set is substituted into a variable, or variables, of the
		inequality.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member
		of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x =
		10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 =
		17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by
		solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
			<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
			<p>
				&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}
				\mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for
		equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling.
		Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides
		of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$
		If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 <
		30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we
		would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation
		returns 2 general rules:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive
			real number, then the inequality is preserved.
		</li>
		<li>
			If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative
			real number, then the inequality is reversed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>More explicit rules:</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<ol>
			<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>

		<h3>Solving Quadratic Equations</h3>
		<p>
			There are four primary ways of finding the truth set of quadratic
			equations:
		</p>

		<figure class="math-display">
			<ol>
				<li>using the square root method;</li>
				<li>factoring;</li>
				<li>completing the square; and</li>
				<li>using the quadratic equation</li>
			</ol>
		</figure>

		<p>The next few sections explore how each of these methods are used.</p>

		<section id="completing_the_square">
			<h3>Completing the Square</h3>
			<p>
				Given the quadratic equation ${x^2 + Ax = B}$ ompleting the square can
				be summarized into a simple algorithm:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<ol class="numd">
					<li>Look at the cofficient of ${x}$, $A$</li>
					<li>Divide the coefficient by 2: ${\dfrac{A}{2}}$</li>
					<li>Square the result: ${\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2}$</li>
					<li>
						Add the number from step 1 to both sides of the equation:
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>
									${x^2 - Ax + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2 = B +
									\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2}$
								</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</li>
					<li>Simplify the equation</li>
					<li>Factor the result</li>
					<li>Solve for $x$</li>
				</ol>
			</figure>

			<p>
				For example, suppose we were confronted by the quadratic equation: ${x^2
				- 2x = 4.}$ Applying the method of completing the square, we look at the
				coefficient of $x$ first. We see that it is -2. We divide this number by
				2 and square it: ${\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.}$ Then we add
				this number to both sides of the equation: ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.}$
				Simplifying, we obtain ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5.}$ We factor the left-hand
				side, and reach ${(x-1)(x-1) = 5,}$ or, with a square, ${(x-1)^2 = 5.}$
				Taking the square root of both sides, we have ${x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}}$
				(always be mindful of the the fact that squares result from both
				positive and negative numbers). Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by adding 1
				to both sides: ${x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.}$ Thus, the truth set of the
				equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is ${x \in \{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5} \}.}$
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="topic">Why Completing the Square Works.</span> The method
				of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose we had a square,
				${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img
					src="{% static 'images/square_of_length_x.svg' %}"
					alt="square"
					class="fifteen-p"
					loading="lazy"
				/>
			</figure>

			<p>
				We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose that
				we were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of $x$ to
				the square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add the
				rectangle, we obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img
					src="{% static 'images/rectangles_added_completing_the_square.svg' %}"
					alt="rectangle added"
					class="twenty-p"
					loading="lazy"
				/>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the added
				rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original square's
				side, and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img
					src="{% static 'images/rearrange_completing_the_square.svg' %}"
					alt="rearrangement"
					class="fifteen-p"
					loading="lazy"
				/>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape
				that would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the
				rectange we created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the two
				halves we created must respectively have an area of
				${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$ Thus, the shape we need to fill the gap
				must have an area of ${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or, simplifying
				the expression, ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$
			</p>

			<p>
				To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape above
				without filling the gap. That shape has an area of ${x^2 +
				\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 + bx.}$
				When we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing square":
				${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area of the
				incomplete shape is a quadratic equation.
			</p>

				If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$, and
				$c$ are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our original
				square has an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations needlessly
				difficult, and we want our original shape to be a square of area
				${x^2}$. Since $a$ is a constant, we can get rid of its place before $x$
				by dividing all of the terms in the equation by $a:$
			</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>
				We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the

			<figure class="math-display">

			<p>
				The term ${b/a}$ represents the side of our added rectangle. The side of

				missing square has an area of
				${\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right) = \frac{b^2}{4a},}$

			<h3>The Quadratic Formula</h3>
			<p>
				The truth set for quadratic equations cannot be found by simple
				factorization. Instead, a more robust formula must be used:
				<span class="term">the quadratic formula</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				From the method of completing the square, we can derive the quadratic
				formula, a formula that allows us to quickly deduce the truth set of a
				quadratic equation. To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general
				quadratic equation: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide
				both sides by $a$, and obtain:
			</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) =
						0.}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a}
						\right).}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both
				sides:
			</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} =
						\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a}}$
					</p>
					<p>
						${\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$
					</p>
					<p>
						${x + \dfrac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} = \pm
						\dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert }}$
					</p>
					<p>${= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:
			</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${x \in \left\{-\dfrac{b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \space
						- \dfrac{b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right\}}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The quadratic formula will
				<span class="underlineText">always</span> yield the truth set for
				quadratic equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In the event that
				the term ${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the
				<span class="italicsText">discriminant</span>), however, the truth set
				of the equation consists of
				<span class="italicsText">complex numbers</span>, rather than
				<span class="italicsText">real numbers</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where
				$a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of the
				equation can be found with the equation:
			</p>

			<h3>The Product &amp; Sum of the Roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$</h3>
			<p>
				Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the
				roots of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation: ${x^2 + 3x -
				5 = 0.}$ Then let's use the quadratic formula:
			</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}$</p>
					<p>${\phantom{x} = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)}}$</p>
					<p>${\phantom{x} = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+20}}{2}}$</p>
					<p>${\phantom{x} = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${ x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 -
						\sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 +
						\sqrt{29}}{2} \right) = \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4}}$
					</p>
					<p>${= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4} = \dfrac{-20}{4} = -5}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the
				two roots?
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} = \dfrac{-3
						+ \sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2}}$
					</p>
					<p>${= \dfrac{-6}{2} = -3}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was
				${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two
				roots is -5, the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots,
				-3, is the negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In
				fact, it follows from a more general rule.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation ${x^2 + bx +
				c = 0.}$ It follows that ${r_1 r_2 = c}$ and ${r_1 + r_2 = -b.}$ In
				other words, the product of the roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is the
				constant term in the equation, $c$, and the sum of the roots is the
				negative of the coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$ (i.e., $-b$).
			</p>

			<p>
				The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula.
				Suppose there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where
				${a = 1.}$ From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the
				equation are:
			</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4(1)c}}{2(1)} = \dfrac{-b \pm

					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>Thus, the roots are:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${r_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
					<p>${r_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>The products of the roots:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${r_1 r_2 = \left(\dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}\right) \left(

					</p>
					<p>
						${\phantom{r_1 r_2} = \dfrac{b^2 - \left( b^2 - 4c \right)}{4} =

					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>And the sum of the roots:</p>

	<h2>Expanding Binomials: The Binomial Theorem</h2>
	<p>
		Recall that a <b>binomial</b> is a polynomial consisting of the sum of two
		monomials. In other words, a polynomial with two terms. For example, the
		expression:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\large ax^m - bx^n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		is a binomial, where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are numbers, ${m}$ and ${n}$ are
		distinct, nonnegative integers, and ${x}$ is a variable (or more formally,
		the <b>indeterminate</b>). Taking higher powers of binomials and expanding
		them is a process that quickly grows tedious. To see how, let's consider a
		few examples.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, let's expand ${(a + b)^0.}$ This is straightforward; it's just ${1:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(a + b)^0 = 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Similarly, ${(a + b)^1}$ isn't so bad either:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(a + b)^1 = a + b}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>${(a + b)^2}$ isn't terrible if we know our expansions by heart:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>How about ${(a + b)^3}$? Well, we can carry it out:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (a + b)^3 &= (a + b)(a + b)(a + b) \\ &= (a + b)(a^2 +
		2ab + b^2) \\ &= a^3 + 2a^2b + ab^2 + a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3 \\ &= a^3 + 3a^2b +
		3ab^2 + b^3 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>And ${(a + b)^4:}$</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (a + b)^4 &= (a + b)(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) \\ &=
		a(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) + b(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)\\ &= a^4 + 3a^3b
		+ 3a^2b^2 + ab^3 + a^3b + 3a^2b^2 + 3ab^3 + b^4 \\ &= a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2
		+ 4ab^3 + b^4 \end{aligned} $$

		Needless to say, expanding binomials with higher powers by hand is tedious
		and prone to error. Attempting to expand something like ${(a + b)^{100}}$
		would take a very, very long time. And then after we're done, we must still
		go through the process of checking if our algebraic manipulation is correct.

		Fortunately, there's a theorem to make our lives easier. But, before we

			To understand where the binomial coefficient comes from, it's helpful to

			possible ways are there to make a cup of sweet coffee? Well, we can
			enumerate the number of ways with a table (where ${c}$ is for coffee,
			${m}$ is for milk, and ${s}$ is for sugar):
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<table class="punnett">

			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Reading the table above, we count six different orders. For example, ${(c,
			m, s)}$ is <q>coffee, then milk, then sugar</q>, and ${(s,m,c)}$ is
			<q>sugar, then milk, then coffee.</q> This result follows directly from
			the <i>multiplication rule</i> in counting. Since we have three different
			ingredients, the number of recipes is yielded by:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Generalizing the multiplication rule, given ${n}$ ingredients and ${k}$
			choices, we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>
					${n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \ldots \times (n - k + 1) =
					\dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Importantly, the question of how many different recipes there are is
			distinct from asking: How many combinations of coffee, sugar, and milk are
			there? The former requires a distinct order, while the latter does not.
			The latter question &mdash; how many different combinations are there
			(disregarding order) &mdash; is what the binomial coefficient attempts to
			capture.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hence, using our sweet coffee example, when write ${\dbinom{3}{2},}$ we
			are expressing the number of combinations of two ingredients among three,
			where order does not matter. If we enumerated all of the possibilities out

			Counting the number of possibilities, we have ${6.}$ But because we're
			disregarding order, the table above is incorrect because we've
			<i>overcounted</i>. Some of the possibilities are duplicated. As such, we
			must eliminate the duplicates:

			<div>
				<table class="punnett">
					<thead>
						<th></th>
						<th>${c}$</th>
						<th>${m}$</th>
						<th>${s}$</th>

						<tr>
							<td>${c}$</td>
							<td></td>
							<td>${(c, m)}$</td>
							<td>${(c, s)}$</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${m}$</td>
							<td>${\cancel{(m, c)}}$</td>
							<td></td>
							<td>${(m, s)}$</td>

		<p>
			Notice that eliminating the overcount leaves us with three possibilities.
			Further notice that this is half of our original count. This is no
			coincidence. Looking back at our general formula for the multiplication
			rule, we can see that eliminating the overcount is a matter of dividing by
			a ${k!}$ term (since we've overcounted by a factor of ${k!}$):

			$$ \begin{aligned} n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \ldots \times (n - k +
			1) &= \dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!} \\[2em] \dfrac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)
			\ldots \times (n - k + 1)}{k!} &= \dfrac{\dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}}{k!} \\[2em]
			&= \dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \end{aligned} $$
