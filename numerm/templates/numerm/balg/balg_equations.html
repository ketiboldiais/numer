<h1>Expressions & Equations</h1>
<section>
	<h2>Truth Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Because expressions contain
		variables, an equation is true or false if, and only if, we substitute
		values into those variables. Until then, an equation is neither true nor
		false. If a value is inputted and the equation is true, we call that value
		the <span class="term">solution</span>, or <span class="term">root</span>,
		of the equation. The set of all roots to an equation is called the
		equation's <span class="term">truth set</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identities.</span> If an equation's truth set is the
		equation's domain, we say that equation is an
		<span class="term">identity</span>. For example, the equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)$, and</p>
			<p>$\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
		substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations true.
	</p>

	<h2>Conditional Equations</h2>
	<p>
		The opposite of an identity is a
		<span class="term">conditional equation</span>. These are equations that are
		true <span class="italicsText">only if</span> some condition(s) is/are true.
		For example, the following are conditional equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$2x = 10$</p>
			<p>$x = x + 1$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The equation
		$x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one more than
		itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation can never
		be true).
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equivalent Equations.</span> Equivalent expressions are
		represented by expressions. Equations themselves can be equivalent. Two
		equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have exactly the same
		solutions.
	</p>

	<h2>Linear Equations in One Variable</h2>

	<p>
		Because equations often share properties, they can be classified into
		various kinds. One such kind is a
		<span class="term">linear equation in one variable</span>. A linear equation
		in one variable is an equation that can be written in the form:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${ax + b = 0}$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, all of the equations below are one-variable linear equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${5x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${2m + 3 = 19}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{3} = \dfrac{y}{5} + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Domain of an Expression.</span> All mathematical
		expressions have a <span class="term">domain</span> &mdash; the set of all
		values for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
		expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
		example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
		debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
		economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
		the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
		is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
		notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of
		$\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?
	</p>

	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			$dom(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
			-3\}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
			the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.
		</p>
	</details>

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>${4x + 3x^{-1} = 4x + \dfrac{3}{x}.}$</p>
		<p>${dom(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}.}$</p>
	</details>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Polynomial Equations</h2>
	<p>
		A
		<span class="term">one-variable polynomial equation</span> is an equation of
		the form:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1}x + a_0 = 0 }$</p>
		</div>
		<ul class="def">
			<li class="where">${a}$ represents a constant, and</li>
			<li>the exponents are nonnegative integers.</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		If ${ a_n \neq 0}$, then the <span class="term">degree</span> of the
		polynomial equation is the largest exponent accompanying a variable in the
		equation. For example, the 1-variable polynomial equation ${ 4x^2 - 5x - 1 =
		0 }$ is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 2, and the equation ${
		3x^5 - 2x^2 + 9 = 0 }$ is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 5.
	</p>

	<p>
		A 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 1 is a
		<span class="italicsText">linear equation</span>. A 1-variable polynomial
		equation of degree 2 is a
		<span class="italicsText">quadratic equation</span>.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Inequalities</h3>

	<p>
		Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than
		equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine
		whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in
		comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal
		sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$
		we obtain an <span class="term">inequality</span>. Both equations and
		inequalities are mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like
		equations, have truth sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the
		inequality true if any member of that set is substituted into a variable, or
		variables, of the inequality.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member
		of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x =
		10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 =
		17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by
		solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
			<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
			<p>
				&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}
				\mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for
		equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling.
		Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides
		of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$
		If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 <
		30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we
		would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation
		returns 2 general rules:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul>
			<li>
				If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive
				real number, then the inequality is preserved.
			</li>
			<li>
				If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative
				real number, then the inequality is reversed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	

	<p>More explicit rules:</p>
	
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>

	<h3>Quadratic Equations</h3>
	<p>
		Quadratic equations are
		equations in one variable that can be written in the form:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		If we seek to determine the the truth set of a quadratic equation (i.e., the
		set of all roots, or values of ${ x }$ where the equation is true), our
		first course of action is to factor. And whenever we factor, we should be
		cognizant of the basic law of multiplication:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">

	<h3>Solving Quadratic Equations</h3>
	<p>
		There are four primary ways of finding the truth set of quadratic
		equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>using the square root method;</li>
			<li>factoring;</li>
			<li>completing the square; and</li>
			<li>using the quadratic equation</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>

	

	<p>The next few sections explore how each of these methods are used.</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Completing the Square.</span> Given the quadratic
		equation ${x^2 + Ax = B}$ ompleting the square can be summarized into a
		simple algorithm:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol class="numd">
			<li>Look at the cofficient of ${x}$, $A$</li>
			<li>Divide the coefficient by 2: ${\dfrac{A}{2}}$</li>
			<li>Square the result: ${\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2}$</li>
			<li>
				Add the number from step 1 to both sides of the equation: 
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${x^2 - Ax +
							\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2 = B + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</li>
			<li>Simplify the equation</li>
			<li>Factor the result</li>
			<li>Solve for $x$</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>

	

	<p>
		For example, suppose we were confronted by the quadratic equation: ${x^2 -
		2x = 4.}$ Applying the method of completing the square, we look at the
		coefficient of $x$ first. We see that it is -2. We divide this number by 2
		and square it: ${\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.}$ Then we add this
		number to both sides of the equation: ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.}$ Simplifying,
		we obtain ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5.}$ We factor the left-hand side, and reach
		${(x-1)(x-1) = 5,}$ or, with a square, ${(x-1)^2 = 5.}$ Taking the square
		root of both sides, we have ${x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}}$ (always be mindful of
		the the fact that squares result from both positive and negative numbers).
		Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by adding 1 to both sides: ${x = 1 \pm
		\sqrt{5}.}$ Thus, the truth set of the equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is ${x \in
		\{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5} \}.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Quadratic Formula</span> From the method of
		completing the square, we can derive the
		<span class="term">quadratic formula</span>, a formula that allows us to
		quickly deduce the truth set of a quadratic equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general quadratic equation: ${ax^2
		+ bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide both sides by $a$, and obtain:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) =
				0.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right).}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both sides:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} =
				\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a}}$
			</p>
			<p>${\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$</p>
			<p>
				${x + \dfrac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} = \pm
				\dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert }}$
			</p>
			<p>${= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${x \in \left\{-\dfrac{b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \space -
				\dfrac{b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right\}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The quadratic formula will <span class="underlineText">always</span> yield
		the truth set for quadratic equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In
		the event that the term ${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the
		<span class="italicsText">discriminant</span>), however, the truth set of
		the equation consists of <span class="italicsText">complex numbers</span>,
		rather than <span class="italicsText">real numbers</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Discriminant.</span> In the quadratic formula, the
		expression that appears below the radical sign, ${b^2 - 4ac,}$ is called the
		<span class="term">discriminant</span>. If the discriminant evaluates to a
		positive real number, then the quadratic equation has 2 real solutions. If
		the discriminant evaluates to 0, then the quadratic equation has only 1 real
		solution. If the discriminant evaluates to a negative real number, then the
		quadratic equation has no real solutions &mdash; instead, it has a pair of
		complex conjugate solutions. Generalizing these results:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \text{roots} \begin{cases} \text{1 distinct real root} &\text{iff } b^2
			- 4ac > 0 \\ \text{2 distinct real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\
			\text{0 real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac < 0 \end{cases} $$
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic"
			>The Product &amp; Sum of the Roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$</span
		>
		Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the roots
		of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation: ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$
		Then let's use the quadratic formula:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{x} = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)}}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{x} = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+20}}{2}}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{x} = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${ x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 -
				\sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 +
				\sqrt{29}}{2} \right) = \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4}}$
			</p>
			<p>${= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4} = \dfrac{-20}{4} = -5}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the two
		roots?
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} = \dfrac{-3 +
				\sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2}}$
			</p>
			<p>${= \dfrac{-6}{2} = -3}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was ${x^2
		+ 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two roots is -5,
		the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots, -3, is the
		negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In fact, it follows
		from a more general rule.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation ${x^2 + bx + c =
		0.}$ It follows that ${r_1 r_2 = c}$ and ${r_1 + r_2 = -b.}$ In other words,
		the product of the roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is the constant term in the
		equation, $c$, and the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient
		of the $x$ term, $b$ (i.e., $-b$).
	</p>

	<p>
		The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula. Suppose
		there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a = 1.}$
		From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the equation are:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4(1)c}}{2(1)} = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2
				- 4c}}{2}.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Thus, the roots are:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${r_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
			<p>${r_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>The products of the roots:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${r_1 r_2 = \left(\dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}\right) \left(

			</p>
			<p>
				${\phantom{r_1 r_2} = \dfrac{b^2 - \left( b^2 - 4c \right)}{4} =
				\dfrac{4c}{4} = c}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>And the sum of the roots:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${r_1 + r_2 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} + \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 -

			</p>
			<p>
				${\phantom{r_1 + r_2} = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c} + (-b) - \sqrt{b^2 -
				4c}}{2} = \dfrac{-2b}{2} = -b}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Reasoning Behind Completing the Square.</span> The
		method of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose we had a
		square, ${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/square_of_length_x.svg' %}"
			alt="square"
			class="thirty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose that we
		were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of $x$ to the
		square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add the rectangle, we
		obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/rectangles_added_completing_the_square.svg' %}"
			alt="rectangle added"
			class="fifty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the added
		rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original square's side,
		and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img

			alt="rearrangement"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"

	</figure>

	<p>
		Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape that
		would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the rectange we
		created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the two halves we created
		must respectively have an area of ${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$ Thus, the
		shape we need to fill the gap must have an area of
		${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or, simplifying the expression,
		${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape above
		without filling the gap. That shape has an area of ${x^2 +
		\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 + bx.}$ When
		we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing square":
		${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area of the incomplete
		shape is a quadratic equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$
		are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our original square has
		an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations needlessly difficult, and
		we want our original shape to be a square of area ${x^2}$. Since $a$ is a
		constant, we can get rid of its place before $x$ by dividing all of the
		terms in the equation by $a:$
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the
		equation, to give us our incomplete shape:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The term ${b/a}$ represents the side of our added rectangle. The
		side of our halved rectangles then, is
		${\frac{b/a}{2} = \frac{b}{2a}}$. And since
		${\frac{b}{2a}}$ represents the side of our halved rectangles, the missing
		square has an area of ${\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)
		= \frac{b^2}{4a},}$ the term we add to both sides of ${x^2 +
		\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)x = - \frac{c}{a}.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where $a$,
		$b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of the equation
		can be found with the equation:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a} = - \dfrac{c}{a} +
				\dfrac{b^2}{4a}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
