<h1>Expressions & Equations</h1>

<section>
	<h2>Truth Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Because expressions contain variables, an equation is true or false if, and
		only if, we substitute values into those variables. Until then, an equation
		is neither true nor false. If a value is inputted and the equation is true,
		we call that value the <span class="term">solution</span>, or
		<span class="term">root</span>, of the equation. The set of all roots to an
		equation is called the equation's <span class="term">truth set</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identities.</span> If an equation's truth set is the
		equation's domain, we say that equation is an
		<span class="term">identity</span>. For example, the equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)$, and</p>
			<p>$\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
		substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations true.
	</p>

	<h2>Conditional Equations</h2>
	<p>
		The opposite of an identity is a
		<span class="term">conditional equation</span>. These are equations that are
		true <span class="italicsText">only if</span> some condition(s) is/are true.
		For example, the following are conditional equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$2x = 10$</p>
			<p>$x = x + 1$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The equation
		$x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one more than
		itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation can never
		be true).
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equivalent Equations.</span> Equivalent expressions are
		represented by expressions. Equations themselves can be equivalent. Two
		equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have exactly the same
		solutions.
	</p>

	<h2>Linear Equations in One Variable</h2>
	<p>
		Because equations often share properties, they can be classified into
		various kinds. One such kind is a
		<span class="term">linear equation in one variable</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A linear equation in one variable
				is an equation that can be written in the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ax + b = 0}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, all of the equations below are one-variable linear equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${5x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${2m + 3 = 19}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{3} = \dfrac{y}{5} + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

		<span class="topic">Domain of an Expression.</span> All mathematical
		expressions have a <span class="term">domain</span> &mdash; the set of all
		values for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
		expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
		example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
		debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
		economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
		the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
		is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
		notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of
		$\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?
	</p>

	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			$dom(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
			-3\}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
			the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.
		</p>
	</details>

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>${4x + 3x^{-1} = 4x + \dfrac{3}{x}.}$</p>
		<p>${dom(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}.}$</p>
	</details>

<section>
	<h2>Polynomial Equations</h2>
	<p>
		All linear equations are instances of
		<span class="term">polynomial equations</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span>
				A
				<span class="term">one-variable polynomial equation</span> is an
				equation of the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1}x + a_0 = 0 }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				where ${a}$ is a constant and the exponents are nonnegative integers.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		If ${ a_n \neq 0}$, then the <span class="term">degree</span> of the
		polynomial equation is the largest exponent accompanying a variable in the
		equation. For example, the 1-variable polynomial equation ${ 4x^2 - 5x - 1 =
		0 }$ is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 2, and the equation ${
		3x^5 - 2x^2 + 9 = 0 }$ is a 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 5.
	</p>

	<p>
		A 1-variable polynomial equation of degree 1 is a
		<span class="italicsText">linear equation</span>. A 1-variable polynomial
		equation of degree 2 is a
		<span class="italicsText">quadratic equation</span>.
	</p>

	<h3>Inequalities</h3>

	<p>
		Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than
		equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine
		whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in
		comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal
		sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$
		we obtain an <span class="term">inequality</span>. Both equations and
		inequalities are mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like
		equations, have truth sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the
		inequality true if any member of that set is substituted into a variable, or
		variables, of the inequality.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member
		of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x =
		10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 =
		17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by
		solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
			<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
			<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
			<p>
				&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}
				\mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for
		equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling.
		Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides
		of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$
		If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 <
		30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we
		would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation
		returns 2 general rules:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul>
			<li>
				If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive
				real number, then the inequality is preserved.
			</li>
			<li>
				If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative
				real number, then the inequality is reversed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>More explicit rules:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and
				${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$
			</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>
		</ol>
