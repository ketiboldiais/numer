	<h4>Proportions</h4>
	<p>
		Suppose there is a ratio of two variable quantities. If this ratio is always
		the same, we say the two quantities are in
		<span class="term">direct proportion</span>. For example, suppose ${x = 5}$
		and ${y = 9.}$ Now suppose that ${x}$ and ${y}$ are directly proportional.
		What is ${y}$ when ${x = 14?}$ Since ${x}$ and ${y}$ are directly
		proportional:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{x}{y} = \dfrac{5}{9}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{5}{9} = \dfrac{14}{y}}$</p>
			<p>${9(14) = 5y}$</p>
			<p>${126 = 5y}$</p>
			<p>${y = 126/5 = 25.2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Another example: Suppose ${a}$ and ${b^2}$ are directly proportional, ${a =
		5,}$ and ${b = 9.}$ What is ${a}$ when ${b = 12?}$ Since ${a}$ and ${b^2}$
		are directly proportional:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{a}{b^2} = \dfrac{5}{(9)^2}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{a}{b^2} = \dfrac{5}{81}}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{5}{81} = \dfrac{a}{(12)^2}}$</p>
			<p>${81a = 5(12)(12)}$</p>
			<p>${(3)(3)(3)(3) a = 5(3)(4)(3)(4)}$</p>
			<p>
				${\cancel{(3)}\cancel{(3)}(3)(3) a = 5\cancel{(3)}(4)\cancel{(3)}(4)}$
			</p>
			<p>${9a = 80}$</p>
			<p>${a = 80/9}$</p>
		</div>
