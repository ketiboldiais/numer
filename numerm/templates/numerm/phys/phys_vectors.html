	<h2>Problem Solving in Physics</h2>
	<p>
		The following problem-solving strategy is often useful for solving physics
		problems:
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identify explicit data.</span> The first step is to
		identify all the relevant data. What are the problem's conditions? Given
		those conditions, what concepts apply?
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identify implicit data.</span> Here, we want to identify
		any data that is implied from the explicit data. For example, if we know
		that ${x + 2 = 4,}$ we have the implicit data that ${x = 2.}$ Identifying
		these implicit data often proves enormously useful for later calculations.
		This is also the step where we identify things we
		<span class="underlineText">don't</span> know. What are the
		<span class="italicsText">target variables</span>? I.e., what are the things
		we want to find out about?
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Set up the problem.</span> This is where we want to
		layout all the equations, algorithms, systems, data structures, and concepts
		necessary to solving the problem. It may seem as if everything is relevant
		&mdash; with practice, this step can become much more like
		pattern-recognition.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Implement and execute the solution.</span> Having laid
		out all of our tools, we now use them to implement a solution. Once
		implemented, we execute the solution and examine the results.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Test.</span> Assuming the results returned correctly, we
		now test. Here, we'll want to replace the provided values with similar ones,
		then begin exploring edge cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Evaluate.</span> Having performed all of the previous
		steps, we must then evaluate the answer. Think of this as writing a journal
		entry for the entire process, a sort of self-reflection. What is the
		significance for each step in the process? What are the solution's
		shortcomings? Were there edge cases that failed?
	</p>
</section>

<section id="modeling">
	<h2>Modeling</h2>
	<p>
		One of the most valuable skills in physics is
		<span class="term">modeling</span> &mdash; the process of reducing complex
		systems into smaller, simplified systems. For example, analyzing the motion
		of a bullet fired from a handgun is terrifyingly complex. How much gunpowder
		is used? What is the chemical composition of said gun powder? What is the
		handgun's model? Air resistance? Bullet's weight? Air temperature? Humidity?
		Distance? Height? All these questions are relevant, and unfortunately, paint
		a freakishly complex reality. If we tried solving the problem by answering
		all these questions at once, we likely wouldn't get anywhere.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, a better approach is to model. Instead of thinking of the bullet
		with all its contours and metallic nature, we just envision a particle.
		Instead of worrying about the gun power chemistry, we just assume some
		initial acceleration. Instead of worrying about air resitance, we assume no
		air resistance; a vaccuum. We make whatever assumptions are necessary to
		make the system as easy as possible to analyze. This is modeling.
	</p>

<section id="units">
	<h2>Units</h2>
	<p>
		In physics, measurements are a quantification of some physical quantity.
		Understanding how physical quantities relate begins with a measurement. And
		it is this understanding that leads to the laws of physics: Expressions of
		mathematical relationships among physical quantities. To understand these
		physical quantities and their relationships, we must properly interpret and
		analyze our measurements. And to do so, we need
		<span class="term">units of measurement</span>. Accordingly, we present in
		this section the relevant units used in these materials, the quantities they
		measure, as well as the algebraic manipulations necessary for interpretation
		and analysis.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are numerous units of measurement. For example, we have kilometers,
		milliseconds, centimeters, grams, micrograms, etc. We also have
		field-specific units. Astronomers use the unit ${\text{AU}}$ (astronomical
		units; the mean distance between the earth and the sun) and ${\text{ly}}$
		(light-years; the distance light travels in vacuum in one Julian year
		&mdash; 365.25 days). Maritime workers are familiar with ${\text{nmi}}$ (the
		nautical mile). Bankers are familiar with dollars, euros, and yen, among
		many others. We also have system-specific units. In the customary system:
		inches, feet, yards, miles, pounds. In the Malagasi system: vari, nanki,
		sompi, bambou. And for the ancient Greeks: daktylos, pous, metretes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some units of measurement are easier to work with than others. It's fairly
		difficult to work with the customary system, in that the units appear
		arbitrarily grouped &mdash; ${12}$ inches to a foot, ${3}$ feet to a yard,
		${1\space760}$ yards to a mile, ${3}$ miles to a league, ${16}$ ounces to a
		pound, ${2\space000}$ pounds to a ton. These are not conducive to easy
		mathematical manipulation. The SI system &mdash; where units are delimited
		via the decimal system &mdash; is far, far easier. Accordingly, this is the
		system we will use.
	</p>
	<p>
		The table below displays the fundamental quantities of physics and their
		units of measurement. These are the quantities of
		<span class="italicsText">length</span>,
		<span class="italicsText">time</span>, and
		<span class="italicsText">mass</span>. They are given the adjective
		&#8220;fundamental&#8221; because many other quantities in physics are
		derived from these quantities.

	<p>
		The quantity of <span class="term">length</span> is the distance between two
		points in space. For example, an object at point ${p_i}$ and an object at
		point ${p_f}$ are separated by a length of ${\lvert p_f - p_i \rvert.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The quantity of <span class="term">mass</span> is the amount of material
		composing an object (alternatively, how much the object resists change in
		its motion). Unlike length, mass is a property that inherently exists in an
		object. I.e., as long as the object exists, there is a mass. Contrast this
		with length, where we require an external reference (the other point) for
		the quantity's definition.
	</p>
	<p>
		The quantity of <span class="term">time</span> is what a clock reads after
		an established reference point. For example, if we start a clock at
		<span class="monoText">00:00:00:000</span> (where each pair of zeros
		represents <span class="monoText">hours:minutes:seconds:centiseconds</span>)
		and stop it at <span class="monoText">00:00:01:067</span>, we would have a
		time of ${1.067}$ seconds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Importantly, the SI unit of measurement increments with powers of ${10.}$ In
		other words, we can express our units with fewer digits through the use of
		prefixes. These prefixes are presented below:

	<p>
		The fundamental quantities of length, time, and mass underlie many of the
		other quantities we will investigate. For example, the quantity of speed,
		denoted with the variable ${s,}$ is the dimension of length divided by the
		dimension of time:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\text{speed} = v = \dfrac{[\text{L}]}{[t]}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We use the square brackets to indicate that we are expressing the
		<span class="italicsText">dimension</span> of the particular quantity,
		rather than the value of the quantity itself. Because length is measured in
		terms of meters and time in terms of seconds, the quantity of speed is
		measured with the unit: ${\text{m/s}.}$ We read this unit as &#8220;meters
		per second.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		The quantity of <span class="term">area</span> represents the amount or
		extent of a surface:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\text{area} = \text{A} = [\text{L}]^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This quantity is measured with ${\text{m}^2,}$ read &#8220;square
		meters.&#8221; The quantity of
		<span class="term">volume</span> represents the amount of three-dimensional
		space enclosed by a surface, measured as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\text{volume} = \text{V} = [\text{L}]^3}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This quantity is measured with the units ${\text{m}^3,}$ read &#8220;cubic
		meters.&#8221; The quantity of <span class="term">density</span> is the
		ratio of a mass to its volume. We can think of it as how
		&#8220;compact&#8221; some object is. A cannon ball of steel no doubt feels
		different in hand than the same cannon ball made of sytrofoam. We represent
		it with the Greek letter rho:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\text{density} = \rho = \dfrac{[\text{M}]}{[\text{L}]^3} }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This yields the unit ${\text{kg}/\text{m}^3,}$ read &#8220;kilograms per
		cubic meters.&#8221; Another particularly important quantity:
		<span class="term">acceleration</span>. It is measured as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\text{acceleration} = a = \dfrac{[\text{L}]}{[t]^2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This yields the unit ${\text{m}/\text{s}^2,}$ read &#8220;meters per second
		squared.&#8221; These are just a sampling of the many other units we will
		encounter in these materials. We present them here because we will encounter
		them shortly, and because they present an ideal starting point for
		exercising the algebraic manipulation necessary for handling units of
		measurement.
	</p>

<section id="uncertainty">
	<h3>Uncertainty</h3>
	<p>
		Every measurement in physics must be provided with an explicit indication of
		uncertainty. Otherwise, the measurement is meaningless. This is because in
		physics (and in another science), we operation on the assumption that the
		<span class="term">true value</span> of a measure exists. But, as a matter
		of logic and practice, we can never know that such a value exists. This
		stems from the fact that measurements are inherently restricted to three
		types of limitations:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<span class="term">Instrumental limitations.</span> All measuring devices
			are limited by how well they are made. Measure with a malfunctioning scale
			or poorly-designed measuring type, and our measurements are off.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="term">Systematic errors.</span> Even if we had the best and
			most expensive measuring device in the world, failing to use the device
			properly can lead to errors. Alternatively, we might operate them properly
			but fail to conduct the experiment as planned. Importantly, these types of
			errors are not remedied by an explicit expression of uncertainty. The only
			remedy is to catch and eliminate them.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="term">Random errors.</span> We can have the most
			well-designed measuring devices, operate them properly, and conduct the
			experiment correctly, but subtle variations in measurement technique and
			minute changes in the experimental environment can cause our measurements
			to be off.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Accordingly, every measurement in physics is a range of values where the
		true value likely falls under. That range is expressed as such:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\text{measurement} = \text{best estimate} \pm \text{uncertainty}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, supposed we placed some object on a scale, and the scale read
		as ${0.023 \text{ kg}.}$ The measurement only has meaning if we provide an
		uncertainty:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0.023 \pm 0.001 \text{ kg}.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="dimensional_analysis">
	<h3>Dimensional Analysis</h3>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">dimension</span> is the power to which a fundamental
		unit (in our case, length, mass, and time) should be raised to express a
		unit of that quantity. For example, the dimension of speed is expressed as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\text{L}^1 t^{\texttt{-}1} \text{M}^0 = \dfrac{\text{L}}{t}.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In physics, the equal sign is used heavily. And from mathematics, we know
		that the equal sign imposes a high burden of proof &mdash; that the
		expression on the left side is the same in every way as the expression on
		the right, and vice versa. Dimensional analysis allows us to satisfy this
		burden of proof by verifying that our units of measurement are the same on
		both sides.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, as we will see later, the distance an object travels over time
		${t}$ with constant acceleration is yielded by the equation:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${x = \dfrac{1}{2}at^2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${x}$ is the distance, ${a}$ is acceleration, and ${t}$ is time. To be
		certain that this equation is correct, we can perform dimensional analysis.
		${x}$ measures distance, which is a length. Accordingly, there must also be
		a dimension of length on the right-hand side. This requirement is satisfied
		by the fact that ${a = [\text{L}]/t^2:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${[\text{L}] = \dfrac{[\text{L}]}{\cancel{\text{L}}} \cdot
				\cancel{[t^2]} = [\text{L}]}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
