<h1>1-dimensional Motion</h1>
<section id="intro">

		<span class="drop">I</span>n this section, we begin by studying
		1-dimensional motion. By 1-dimensional motion, we mean motion along a
		straight line. This is the simplest kind of motion, and the principles
		presented here form the basis for more complex motions we will soon cover.
