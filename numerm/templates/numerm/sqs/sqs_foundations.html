<h1>Number Sequences</h1>
<section class="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">A</span> <span class="term">number sequence</span> is an ordered list of numbers.
		In computer science, we might think of that sequence as an
		<span class="italicsText">array</span>. The sequence's order is defined by a
		rule. The rule might be described symbolically (to be discussed momentarily)
		or with words. For example, the rule &#8220;The sequence starts at 1 and
		each term is 2 more than the previous term&#8221; yields the sequence:
		${\lang 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots \rang.}$

		Some sequences carry on forever. We call such sequences
		<span class="term">infinite sequences</span>. For example, the sequence of
		natural numbers, ${\langle 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \rangle}$ is a sequence that
		goes on forever. In contrast, other sequences are finite. For example, the
		sequence of all natural numbers less than 5, ${\langle 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
		\rangle,}$ is a finite sequence.

	<p>
		As we might notice, English is a poor language for describing number
		sequences. Even the slightest complexity can lead to descriptions that are
		difficult to state and parse. Considering this difficulty, we often want to
		either: (a) list all of the terms (for finite sequences); (b) listing the
		first few terms and assuming the pattern continues indefinitely with
		ellipses (a dangerous tactic); (c) using a formula to represent the
		<span class="term">${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term</span>, or
		<span class="italicsText">general term</span>; (d) using a
		<span class="term">recurrence formula</span> to describe the
		${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term; of (e) representing the sequence with a
		graph.
	</p>

	<p>
		Usually, we are most interested in formulas and graphs, but we will
		occassionally consider the other options for comparisons. For example,
		consider the following pyramid:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sqs_pyramid.svg' %}"
			alt="Pyramid recursion"
			loading="lazy"
			width="220w"
			height="220vw"
		/>
		<figcaption>A pyramid with blocks, where ${i}$ is a row.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>We can express this pyramid as a number sequence. For each row, represend by ${i,}$ there are a certain number of blocks. In words: &#8220;A pyramid where the top row consists of 1 block, and subsequent rows consist of 1 block more than the preceding.&#8221; Listing the terms: ${\lang 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \rang.}$ Or, with an explicit formula: ${u_n = n}$ Confirming the formula:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$
				\begin{align*}
					 u_1 &= 1 \\
					 u_2 &= 2 \\
					 u_3 &= 3 \\
					 \vdots
				\end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Or, with a recurrence formula: ${u_1 = 1; \space u_n = u_{n-1} + 1; \space n > 1.}$ Finally, with a graph:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sqs_pyramidGraph.svg' %}"
			alt="Pyramid recursion graph"
			loading="lazy"
			width="220w"
			height="220vw"
		/>
		<figcaption>With a graph, we do not draw any line between the points; these are strictly integer values.</figcaption>
