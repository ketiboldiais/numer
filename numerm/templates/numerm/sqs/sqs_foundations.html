<h1>Sequences & Series</h1>
<section class="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">A</span> <b>number sequence</b> is an ordered list
		of numbers. In computer science, we might think of that sequence as an
		<i>array</i>. The sequence's order is defined by a rule. The rule might
		be described symbolically (to be discussed momentarily) or with words.
		For example, the rule &#8220;The sequence starts at 1 and each term is
		2 more than the previous term&#8221; yields the sequence: ${\lang 1, 3,
		5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots \rang.}$<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Note that we define the natural numbers ${N}$ to include 0. Other
			texts may define ${N}$ as not including ${0.}$ Because we define the
			natural numbers to include ${0,}$ the first term of a sequence has an
			index of ${0.}$ I.e., in this text, we will always start the ordinal
			numbers from ${0.}$

		<p>The notation:</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\lang a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n \rang}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			denotes a number sequence, where ${a_i}$ is a
			<i>term</i>, or <i>member</i>, of the sequence.
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		Sequences are inherently functions. Accordingly, every sequence is a
		relation between two sets, the <i>domain</i> and the <i>image</i>. The
		domain of a sequence is always a subset of the integers; i.e., either
		the natural numbers ${\N,}$ or the positive integers ${\Z^{+}.}$ The
		terms of the sequence are the elements of the image that map to the
		domain. That image need not be integers; it could be floating point
		numbers, strings, or various constants.
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>definition</small>
		<p>
			A sequence is a <i>function</i> from a subset of the set of integers
			to a set ${S.}$ The notation ${a_n}$ denotes the <i>image</i> of the
			integer ${n.}$ An image of the set integer ${n}$ is called the
			<b>term</b> of the sequence.
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		Example: The sequence ${\lang a_n : a_n = \dfrac{1}{n} \rang}$ denotes
		the sequence ${\lang 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots
		\rang.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Some sequences carry on forever. We call such sequences
		<b>infinite sequences</b>. For example, the sequence of natural
		numbers, ${\langle 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \rangle}$ is a sequence that goes
		on forever. In contrast, other sequences are finite. For example, the
		sequence of all natural numbers less than 5, ${\langle 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
		\rangle,}$ is a finite sequence.

	<p>
		As we might notice, English is a poor language for describing number
		sequences. Even the slightest complexity can lead to descriptions that
		are difficult to state and parse. Considering this difficulty, we often
		want to either: (a) list all of the terms (for finite sequences); (b)
		listing the first few terms and assuming the pattern continues
		indefinitely with ellipses (a dangerous tactic); (c) using a formula to
		represent the
		<b>${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term</b>, or <i>general term</i>; (d)
		using a <b>recurrence formula</b> to describe the
		${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term; of (e) representing the sequence
		with a graph.
	</p>

	<p>
		Usually, we are most interested in formulas and graphs, but we will
		occassionally consider the other options for comparisons. For example,
		consider the following pyramid:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sqs_pyramid.svg' %}"
			alt="Pyramid recursion"
			loading="lazy"
			width="150w"
			height="150vw"
		/>
		<figcaption>A pyramid with blocks, where ${i}$ is a row.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can express this pyramid as a number sequence. For each row,
		represend by ${i,}$ there are a certain number of blocks. In words:
		&#8220;A pyramid where the top row consists of 1 block, and subsequent
		rows consist of 1 block more than the preceding.&#8221; Listing the
		terms: ${\lang 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \rang.}$ Or, with an explicit
		formula: ${u_n = n}$ Confirming the formula:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{align*} u_0 &= 1 \\ u_1 &= 2 \\ u_2 &= 3 \\ \vdots
			\end{align*} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Or, with a recurrence formula: ${u_0 = 1; \space u_n = u_{n-1} + 1;
		\space n > 1.}$ Finally, with a graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sqs_pyramidGraph.svg' %}"
			alt="Pyramid recursion graph"
			loading="lazy"
			width="220w"
			height="220vw"
		/>
		<figcaption>
			With a graph, we do not draw any line between the points; these are
			strictly integer values.

	<h2>Arithmetic Sequence</h2>
	<p>Consider the following sequence ${A}$:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A = \lang 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, \ldots \rang}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Each subsequent element in the sequence ${A}$ differs from the previous
		term by ${0.5,}$ or ${\frac{1}{2}.}$ This is an example of an
		arithmetic sequence. An <b>arithmetic sequence</b> is a sequence where
		each subsequent term differs from the previous by the same fixed
		number. Arithmetric sequences are also called
		<i>arithmetic progressions</i>.
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>definition</small>
		<p>An <i>arithmetic sequence</i> is a sequence of the form:</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\lang a, {a + d}, {a + 2d}, {\ldots}, {a + nd} \rang}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where ${a,}$ the initial term, and ${d,}$ the common difference, are
			real numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, the sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is arithmetic if and
			only if ${u_{n + 1} - u_{n} = d.}$
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		We can think of arithmetic sequences as analogous the linear function
		${f(x) = dx + a.}$ For example, with the sequence ${C = \lang 1, 3, 5,
		7, 9, \ldots \rang},$ the linear function is ${f(x) = 2x + 1,}$ where
		${x \in \N.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		<small>why &#8220;arithmetic&#8221;?</small>
		The arithmetic sequence is called arithmetic because every term in the
		sequence is the <b>arithmetic mean</b> of its two adjacent terms. The
		arithmetic mean is a kind of average, and one of the
		<b>Pythagorean means</b>.<sup></sup>
		The arithmetic mean is defined as follows:
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			The Pythagorean means are the <i>arithmetic mean</i>, the
			<i>geometric mean</i>, and the <i>harmonic mean</i>. The Pythagorean
			means were special averages studied by the Pythagoreans because of
			their relationships to geometry and music.
		</p>
	</div>

	<dfn>
		<small>definition</small>
		<p>
			Given a data set ${X = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \},}$ the
			<i>arithmetic mean</i>, denoted ${A}$ (&#8220;${x}$ bar&#8221;), is
			the mean of the the ${n}$ values ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n.}$ It is
			defined by the formula:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${A = \dfrac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</dfn>

	<p>For example, the arithmetic mean of the numbers ${1, 2, 3}$ is:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{1 + 2 + 3}{3} = 2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In early mathematics, this is often simply called the
		&#8220;mean,&#8221; or, somewhat misleadingly, the
		&#8220;average&#8221; (there are different kinds of averages).
	</p>
	<p>
		Returning to our arithmetic sequence, suppose we had a sequence of the
		form ${\lang a, b, c \rang.}$ If we equate the common difference:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${b - a = c - b}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>then rearrange:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${2b = a + c}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>the middle term, ${b,}$ is:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${b = \dfrac{a + c}{2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, consider the arithmetic sequence ${\lang 10, 11, 12
		\rang.}$ ${10 + 12 = 22.}$ Divide ${22}$ by ${2,}$ and we have ${11,}$
		the middle term.
	</p>

	<h3>General Term Formula</h3>
	<p>
		Let's say the first term of some arithmetic sequence is ${u_0,}$ and
		the common difference is ${d.}$ Because each term in an arithmetic
		sequence is some number ${d}$ plus the previous term, it follows that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ u_1 = u_0 + d \\[1em] u_2 = u_0 + 2d \\[1em] u_3 = u_0 + 3d
			\\[1em] u_4 = u_0 + 4d \\[1em] \vdots $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can generalize this pattern into a formula: ${u_n = u_0 + nd,}$
		where ${n \in \N.}$<sup></sup> The number ${n}$ is the term number, or
		the <b>index</b> of the term and the number ${d}$ is called the
		<b>common difference.</b>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Where the natural numbers are defined as not including 0, the formula
			is: ${u_n = u_1 + (n - 1)d.}$ The ${-1}$ must be included because
			where ${0 \notin \N,}$ the index starts at 1.
		</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="geometric_sequence">
	<h2>Geometric Sequences</h2>
	<p>Consider the following sequence:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\lang 2, 10, 50, 250, \ldots \rang}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In this sequence, each subsequent term is 5 times the previous. We call
		this sequence a <b>geometric sequence</b>. A sequence is geometric if
		subsequent terms are obtained by multiplying the previous term with the
		same non-zero constant. Geometric sequences are also called
		<i>geometric progressions</i>.
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>definition</small>
		<p>A geometric sequence is a sequence of the form:</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${a, ar, ar^2, \ldots, ar^n, \ldots}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			where the initial term ${a}$ and the
			<b>common ratio</b> ${r}$ are real numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, the sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is geometric if, and
			only if, ${r = \dfrac{u_{n+1}}{u_n}}$ for all ${n, r \in \Z^{+}.}$
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		Notice that the geometric sequence is analogous, to the exponential
		function ${f(x) = ar^x.}$ For example, consider the sequence ${B =
		\lang 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, \ldots \rang.}$ Each term in this sequence
		is a product of 2 times the previous term. Accordingly, we can
		represent this sequence as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u = 2; u_n = u2^n,}$ where ${u, n \in \N}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, ${u_0 = 2(2^0) = 2,}$ ${u_1 = 2(2^1) = 4,}$ ${u_2 = 2(2^2) = 8,}$
		${u_3 = 2(2^3) = 16,}$ and so on. In terms of functions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = 2^x,}$ where ${x \in \N}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Why &#8220;geometric?&#8221; The geometric sequence is so named because
		each term in the sequence is the
		<b>geometric mean</b> of its adjacent terms (similar to the arithmetic
		mean). We saw that with the arithmetic mean, the mean, or average, was
		computed by the using the sum of the ${n}$ values. With the geometric
		mean, we use the <i>product</i> of the ${n}$ values. Formally:
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>definition</small>
		<p>
			Given a data set ${X = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \},}$ the
			<i>geometric mean</i>, denoted ${G}$, is the mean of the the ${n}$
			values ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n.}$ It is defined by the formula:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${G = \sqrt[n]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot x_n}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>where ${G, x_i \in \Z^{+}.}$</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		In other words, the geometric mean is the
		${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ root of the product of ${n}$ numbers.
		For example, given the numbers ${2, 4, 8,}$ we have: ${G =
		\sqrt[3]{(2)(4)(8)} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Returning to our geometric sequence, say we had the geometric sequence
		${\lang x, y, z \rang.}$ From the definition of a geometric sequence,
		it follows that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{z}{y}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		It then follows that ${y^2 =xz.}$ Accordingly, ${y = \pm \sqrt{xz}.}$
		The expression ${\sqrt{xz}}$ is the
		<i>geometric mean</i> of ${x}$ and ${z,}$ the two terms adjacent to
		${y.}$
	</p>

	<h3>General Term Formula</h3>
	<p>
		Let's say the initial term of a geometric sequence is ${u_0,}$ and the
		common ratio is ${r.}$ It follows that:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} u_1 &= u_0r \\[1em] u_2 &= u_0r^2 \\[1em] u_3 &=
			u_0r^3 \\[1em] u_4 &= u_0r^4 \\[1em] \vdots \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Like the arithmetic sequence, we can generalize this pattern into a
		formula. The ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term of a geometric
		sequence is given by:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u_n = u_0r^n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here, ${n \in \N,}$ and ${u_n}$ is the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$
		term. ${n}$ is the index of the term, ${u_0}$ is the initial term, and
		${r}$ is the common ratio.<sup></sup>
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Where ${0 \notin \N,}$ the formula is ${u_n = u_1r^{n-1}.}$ Again,
			because the index starts at ${1,}$ we must subtract ${1}$ from the
			index.
		</p>
	</div>

<section id="harmonic_sequence">
	<h2>Harmonic Sequences</h2>
	<p>Earlier, we introduced the following sequence:</p>
	<figure>

		<p>A <i>harmonic sequence</i> is a sequence of the form:</p>

			<div>
				<p>
					${\space \lang a, \space \dfrac{1}{a}, \space \dfrac{1}{a + 2d},
					\space \dfrac{1}{a + 2d}, \space \ldots, \space \dfrac{1}{a + nd}
					\space \rang}$

		<p>
			The sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is harmonic if and only if its terms
			are the reciprocals of an arithmetic progression that
			<span class="underlineText">does not contain 0.</span>
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		Notice that the harmonic sequence consists of the reciprocals of terms
		in an arithmetic sequence. For example, the harmonic sequence ${\lang
		1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots \frac{1}{n} \rang}$
		consists of the reciprocals of the arithmetic sequence ${\lang 1, 2, 3,
		4, \ldots, n \rang.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		In terms of functions, the harmonic sequence is analogous to the
		rational function ${f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x},}$ where ${x \in \Z^{+}.}$
		Notice that we use denote the set of positive integers, ${\Z^{+}.}$
		This is because ${x}$ cannot include ${0,}$ and we customarily define
		the set of natural numbers ${\N}$ to include ${0.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Why &#8220;harmonic&#8221;? The harmonic sequence is so-named from the
		fact that each term in the seqeuence is the

			Given a data set ${X = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \},}$ the
			<i>harmonic mean</i>, denoted ${H}$, is the mean of the the ${n}$
			values ${x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n.}$ It is defined by the formula:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>

					${H = \dfrac{n}{\dfrac{1}{x_1} + \dfrac{1}{x_2} + \ldots +
					\dfrac{1}{x_n}}}$

	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} H &= \dfrac{3}{\dfrac{1}{1} + \dfrac{1}{2} +

		From the harmonic sequence perspective, if we had the sequence ${\lang
		\dfrac{1}{a}, \dfrac{1}{b}, \dfrac{1}{c}, \rang}$ the term
		${\dfrac{1}{b}}$ is the harmonic mean of its neighbors,
		${\dfrac{1}{a}}$ and ${\dfrac{1}{c}:}$ This follows directly from the
		fact that ${\lang a, b, c \rang}$ is an arithmetic progression.

	<h2>Recurrence Relations</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>recurrence relation</b> (or <i>recurrence formula</i>) is an
		equation that describes the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term of a
		sequence by using the preceding terms. Accordingly, every recurrence
		formula must specify the initial terms necessary for the formula to
		begin with. For example, to denote the sequence ${4, 7, 10, 13, 16,
		\ldots}$ we can write:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u_0 = 4, u_n = u_{n-1} + 3, n > 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Recurrence relations are the bedrock of
		<b>recursion</b> in programming. Indeed, understanding recursion is a
		natural consequence of understanding recurrence relations. Let's state
		the formal definition of a recurrence relation:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>definition</small>
		<p>
			A <i>recurrence relation</i> for a given sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$
			is an equation that expresses ${\lang u_n \rang}$ in terms of one or
			more of the previous terms of the sequence; i.e., ${u_0, u_1, \ldots,
			u_{n-1},}$ where ${n \in \N.}$ The sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is a
			<i>solution</i> of the recurrence relation if all its terms satisfy
			the recurrence relation. The recurrence relation
			<i>recursively defines</i> the sequence ${u_n.}$
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		Recurrence relations must always specify
		<b>initial conditions</b>. The initial conditions are the premises that
		must be true before the recurrence relation is found to be true or
		false. For example, consider the sequence ${\lang 1, 3, 9, 27, 81,
		\ldots \rang.}$ This is a geometric sequence, where each term is 3
		times the previous. We can define this sequence with the following
		recurrence relation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${u_0 = 1; u_n = u_0(3^n),}$ where ${n \in \N}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In this case, the initial condition is ${u_0 = 1.}$ In other words, the
		initial term in the sequence is 1. This must be stated for the
		recurrence relation to be properly interpreted; otherwise, ${u_0}$
		could be any number, in which case it would be not correctly define the
		sequence.
	</p>

		In the examples above, we saw summations of the terms in a sequence.

		${\lang u_n \rang,}$ with ${n}$ terms, the corresponding series is

<section id="summations">
	<h2>Summations</h2>

	<p>
		In finance, an <b>annuity</b> is a financial instrument that pays a
		fixed amount of money each year. More specifically, it's a contractual
		right to receive a fixed payment each year (for the
		<i>annuity recipient</i>), or a contractual obligation to pay a fixed
		payment each year (for the <i>annuity issuer</i>). There are numerous
		kinds of annuities. A student loan is an annuity. The annuity recipient
		is a student, and the annuity issuer is a bank. A home mortgage is an
		annuity. The annuity recipient is a homeowner, and the annuity issuer
		is again some bank. A payday loan is another annuity. The annuity
		recipient is some individual, and the annuity issuer is likely a
		predatory lender.
	</p>

	<p>
		All of annuities have a value. For example, for the student loan, the
		amount of money given to pay the school is the annuity's value. Each
		month, the student must send the annuity issuer a check. We'll start
		with a basic definition:
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>definition: ${n}$-year annuity</small>
		<p>
			Let ${n, m \in \N.}$ An ${n}$-year ${m}$-payment payment annuity pays
			${m}$ dollars at the start of each year, for ${n}$ years.
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		${n}$-year annuities have many forms. For example, many lotteries like
		Megabucks don't actually pay winners a lump sum of a million dollars.
		Instead, winners are given ${\$50~000}$ per year for ${20}$ years.
		Here's a question: Would we rather have ${\$700~000}$ today, or
		${\$50~000}$ a year for ${20}$ years? To answer this question, we'll
		need some notation.
	</p>

	<p>Consider the sequence of the cardinal numbers:</p>

	<figure>$$\lang 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots \rang$$</figure>

	<p>
		What is the sum of all the numbers of this sequence? We might answer
		with ${\infty,}$ but that wouldn't be a very useful answer. The sum of
		${\lang 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \rang}$ is ${\infty}$ as well, and that is a
		very different sequence. A more useful answer would be to express the
		sum as a more general equation. To do so, we use the concept of
		<b>summation</b> &mdash; the operation of adding all the terms of a
		sequence.
	</p>

	<p>
		Summation has its own special notation, called
		<i>summation notation</i> or <i>sigma notation</i>:
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>notation</small>
		<p>Given the sequence ${\lang a_m, a_{m+1}, \ldots, a_n \rang:}$</p>

		<figure>
			$$ \sum\limits_{i = m}^{n} a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + \ldots + a_n$$
		</figure>

		<p>Or, equivalently:</p>

		$$\sum_{i = m}^{n} a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + \ldots + a_n \\[1em] \sum_{m
		\leq i \leq n} a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + \ldots + a_n$$

		<p>
			The variable ${i}$ is called the <b>index</b> of the summation; the
			variable ${m}$ is called the <b>lower limit</b>; and the variable
			${n}$ is called the <b>upper limit</b>.
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		As indicated above, there are multiple ways to express a summation. We
		will use the first notation, ${\sum\limits_{i = m}^{n} a_i.}$ The
		symbol ${\sum}$ is the Greek letter <i>sigma</i>, and its use for
		summation traces all the way back to Leonhard Euler in 1755. The
		notation was later adopted by the French mathematician Joseph-Louis
		Lagrange, but it didn't catch on until the early 1800s. Before Euler's
		notation, European mathematicians employed a capital ${S}$ to express
		summations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Summation notation allows us to express sums of sequences succinctly.
		For example, instead of writing ${u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + \ldots + u_n,}$ we
		simply write ${\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}u_k.}$ We read the expression
		${\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}u_k}$ as &#8220;The sum of all numbers of the
		form u_k where ${k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots,}$ up to ${n.}$&#8221; Think of
		the bottom part of the sigma as telling us the smallest value ${k}$ can
		be, and the top part as telling us the biggest value ${k}$ can be.
		I.e., the bottom part tells us the first element, and the top part
		tells us the last element.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, consider the sequence ${\lang 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2,
		\ldots \rang.}$ We can express the sum of this sequence as:
	</p>

	<figure>$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} i^2$$</figure>

	<p>
		If we wanted to represent the sum of the first 5 terms of the sequence:
	</p>

	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{5} &= 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 +
		5^2 \\ &= 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 \\ &= 55 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>

	<p>
		Let's apply this notation to our ${n}$-year annuity. Recall that we're
		asked to pick between two choices:
	</p>

	<ol class="lalpha">
		<li>${\$ 500~000}$ upfront</li>
		<li>${\$ 50~000 / \textsf{y}}$ for ${20}$ years.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		To make our decision, we'll make an assumption &mdash; that the money's
		value devalues<sup></sup> at a fixed rate, called the
		<b>interest rate</b>, denoted ${p.}$ We can think of this rate as some
		percentage.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose we have an interest rate ${p,}$ with a principal
		of ${\$ 1.00.}$ Over the course of the next few years:
	</p>
	<table class="alg center c2left">
		<thead>
			<th>Year</th>
			<th>Value ($)</th>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>0</td>
				<td>1</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>${1 + (p \cdot 1)}$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>${1 + p(p \cdot 1)}$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>${1 + p(1 + p(p \cdot 1))}$</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			We use the term <i>devalues</i> because to make our choice, we must
			compare the present values of the two choices. If we were trying to
			determine the future value of two present choices, we would use the
			term <i>appreciates</i>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<section id="properties_of_sigma_notation">
		<h3>Properties of Sigma Notation</h3>
		<p>
			Recall that there are finite sequences and infinite sequences. The
			summations of finite sequences have several useful properties. For
			example, suppose we had two finite sequences, ${\lang a_k \rang}$ and
			${\lang b_k \rang.}$ We can represent the sum of these sequences as
			follows:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \\[1em] \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} b_k$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			What might be the sum of the sequence ${a_k}$ and ${b_k?}$ Well, we
			can express this sum as:
		</p>
		<figure>$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} (a_k + b_k$}$</figure>
		<p>If we expand this summation:</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} (a_k + b_k) = (a_1 + b_1) + (a_2 + b_2) +
			(a_3 + b_3) + \ldots + (a_n + b_n)$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Now, by the associative and commutative properties, we can rewrite
			the right-hand side of the equation as:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} (a_k + b_k) = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots
			a_n) + (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + \ldots + b_n)$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Notice the grouping of ${a_k}$ and ${b_k.}$ We can express those
			groups in summation notation:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} (a_k + b_k) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}a_k +
			\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} b_k$$
		</figure>
		<p>Accordingly, we have the following property:</p>

		<dfn>
			<small>additive property of finite sums</small>
			<p>
				Given the finite sequences ${\lang a_k \rang}$ and ${\lang b_k
				\rang,}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} (a_k + b_k) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} a_k
				+ \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n} b_k$$
			</figure>
		</dfn>

		<p>
			Next, suppose we had the the sequence ${\lang Ca_k \rang,}$ where
			${C}$ is a constant real number. The sum of this sequence would be
			represented as:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}Ca_k = Ca_1 + Ca_2 + Ca_3 + \ldots + Ca_n$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			By the distributive law, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the
			equation as:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}Ca_k = C(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_n)$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Once again, notice the grouping of ${a_k.}$ We can express that
			grouping with summation notation, yielding the following:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}Ca_k = C \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}a_k$$
		</figure>
		<p>From this analysis, we have the following property:</p>

		<dfn>
			<small>homogenous property of finite sums</small>
			<p>
				Given the finite sequence ${\lang a_k \rang}$ and some constant ${C
				\in \R,}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}Ca_k = C \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}a_k$$
			</figure>
