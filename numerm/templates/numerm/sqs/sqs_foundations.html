		<span class="drop">A</span> <span class="term">number sequence</span> is an
		ordered list of numbers. In computer science, we might think of that
		sequence as an <span class="italicsText">array</span>. The sequence's order
		is defined by a rule. The rule might be described symbolically (to be
		discussed momentarily) or with words. For example, the rule &#8220;The
		sequence starts at 1 and each term is 2 more than the previous term&#8221;
		yields the sequence: ${\lang 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots \rang.}$

		Sequences are inherently functions. Accordingly, every sequence is a
		relation between two sets, the <span class="italicsText">domain</span> and
		the <span class="italicsText">image</span>. The domain of a sequence is
		always a subset of the integers; i.e., either the natural numbers ${\N,}$ or
		the positive integers ${\Z^{+}.}$ The terms of the sequence are the elements
		of the image that map to the domain. That image need not be integers; it
		could be floating point numbers, strings, or various constants.

				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A sequence is a
				<span class="italicsText">function</span> from a subset of the set of
				integers to a set ${S.}$ The notation ${a_n}$ denotes the
				<span class="italicsText">image</span> of the integer ${n.}$ An image of
				the set integer ${n}$ is called the <span class="term">term</span> of
				the sequence.

		Example: The sequence ${\lang a_n : a_n = \dfrac{1}{n} \rang}$ denotes the
		sequence ${\lang 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots \rang.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Some sequences carry on forever. We call such sequences
		<span class="term">infinite sequences</span>. For example, the sequence of
		natural numbers, ${\langle 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \rangle}$ is a sequence that
		goes on forever. In contrast, other sequences are finite. For example, the
		sequence of all natural numbers less than 5, ${\langle 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
		\rangle,}$ is a finite sequence.

	<p>
		As we might notice, English is a poor language for describing number
		sequences. Even the slightest complexity can lead to descriptions that are
		difficult to state and parse. Considering this difficulty, we often want to
		either: (a) list all of the terms (for finite sequences); (b) listing the
		first few terms and assuming the pattern continues indefinitely with
		ellipses (a dangerous tactic); (c) using a formula to represent the
		<span class="term">${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term</span>, or
		<span class="italicsText">general term</span>; (d) using a
		<span class="term">recurrence formula</span> to describe the
		${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term; of (e) representing the sequence with a
		graph.
	</p>

	<p>
		Usually, we are most interested in formulas and graphs, but we will
		occassionally consider the other options for comparisons. For example,
		consider the following pyramid:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sqs_pyramid.svg' %}"
			alt="Pyramid recursion"
			loading="lazy"
			width="150w"
			height="150vw"
		/>
		<figcaption>A pyramid with blocks, where ${i}$ is a row.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can express this pyramid as a number sequence. For each row, represend by
		${i,}$ there are a certain number of blocks. In words: &#8220;A pyramid
		where the top row consists of 1 block, and subsequent rows consist of 1
		block more than the preceding.&#8221; Listing the terms: ${\lang 1, 2, 3, 4,
		\ldots \rang.}$ Or, with an explicit formula: ${u_n = n}$ Confirming the
		formula:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{align*} u_0 &= 1 \\ u_1 &= 2 \\ u_2 &= 3 \\ \vdots \end{align*}
			$$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Or, with a recurrence formula: ${u_0 = 1; \space u_n = u_{n-1} + 1; \space n
		> 1.}$ Finally, with a graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/sqs_pyramidGraph.svg' %}"
			alt="Pyramid recursion graph"
			loading="lazy"
			width="220w"
			height="220vw"
		/>
		<figcaption>
			With a graph, we do not draw any line between the points; these are
			strictly integer values.

<section id="arithmetic_sequence">
	<h2>Arithmetic Sequence</h2>
	<p>Consider the following sequence ${A}$:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A = \lang 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, \ldots \rang}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Each subsequent element in the sequence ${A}$ differs from the previous term
		by ${0.5,}$ or ${\frac{1}{2}.}$ This is an example of an arithmetic
		sequence. An <span class="term">arithmetic sequence</span> is a sequence
		where each subsequent term differs from the previous by the same fixed
		number. Arithmetric sequences are also called
		<span class="italicsText">arithmetic progressions</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> An
				<span class="italicsText">arithmetic sequence</span> is a sequence of
				the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\lang a, {a + d}, {a + 2d}, {\ldots}, {a + nd} \rang}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				where ${a,}$ the initial term, and ${d,}$ the common difference, are
				real numbers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively, the sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is arithmetic if and
				only if ${u_{n + 1} - u_{n} = d.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can think of arithmetic sequences as analogous the linear function ${f(x)
		= dx + a.}$ For example, with the sequence ${C = \lang 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots
		\rang},$ the linear function is ${f(x) = 2x + 1,}$ where ${x \in \N.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why &#8220;arithmetic&#8221;?</span>
		The arithmetic sequence is called arithmetic because every term in the
		sequence is the <span class="term">arithmetic mean</span> of its two
		adjacent terms. Suppose we had a sequence of the form ${\lang a, b, c
		\rang.}$ If we equate the common difference:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${b - a = c - b}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Rearranging, we have:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2b = a + c}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The middle term, ${b,}$ is:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${b = \dfrac{a + c}{2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, consider the arithmetic sequence ${\lang 10, 11, 12 \rang.}$
		${10 + 12 = 22.}$ Divide ${22}$ by ${2,}$ and we have ${11,}$ the middle
		term.
	</p>

	<h3>General Term Formula</h3>
	<p>
		Let's say the first term of some arithmetic sequence is ${u_0,}$ and the
		common difference is ${d.}$ Because each term in an arithmetic sequence is
		some number ${d}$ plus the previous term, it follows that:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ u_1 = u_0 + d \\[1em] u_2 = u_0 + 2d \\[1em] u_3 = u_0 + 3d \\[1em] u_4
			= u_0 + 4d \\[1em] \vdots $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can generalize this pattern into a formula: ${u_n = u_0 + nd,}$ where ${n
		\in \N.}$ <label for="aside1" class="margin-toggle"><sup></sup></label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="aside1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />
		<span class="marginnote"
			>Where the natural numbers are defined as not including 0, the formula is:
			${u_n = u_1 + (n - 1)d.}$ The ${-1}$ must be included because where ${0
			\notin \N,}$ the index starts at 1.</span
		>
		The number ${n}$ is the term number, or the
		<span class="term">index</span> of the term and the number ${d}$ is called
		the
		<span class="term">common difference.</span>
	</p>
</section>

<section id="geometric_sequence">
	<h2>Geometric Sequences</h2>
	<p>Consider the following sequence:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lang 2, 10, 50, 250, \ldots \rang}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In this sequence, each subsequent term is 5 times the previous. We call this
		sequence a <span class="term">geometric sequence</span>. A sequence is
		geometric if subsequent terms are obtained by multiplying the previous term
		with the same non-zero constant. Geometric sequences are also called
		<span class="italicsText">geometric progressions</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A geometric sequence is a
				sequence of the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a, ar, ar^2, \ldots, ar^n, \ldots}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				where the initial term ${a}$ and the
				<span class="term">common ratio</span> ${r}$ are real numbers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively, the sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is geometric if, and
				only if, ${r = \dfrac{u_{n+1}}{u_n}}$ for all ${n, r \in \Z^{+}.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that the geometric sequence is analogous, to the exponential function
		${f(x) = ar^x.}$ For example, consider the sequence ${B = \lang 2, 4, 8, 16,
		32, 64, \ldots \rang.}$ Each term in this sequence is a product of 2 times
		the previous term. Accordingly, we can represent this sequence as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${u = 2; u_n = u2^n,}$ where ${u, n \in \N}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, ${u_0 = 2(2^0) = 2,}$ ${u_1 = 2(2^1) = 4,}$ ${u_2 = 2(2^2) = 8,}$
		${u_3 = 2(2^3) = 16,}$ and so on. In terms of functions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = 2^x,}$ where ${x \in \N}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Why &#8220;Geometric?&#8221;</span> The geometric
		sequence is so named because a term in the sequence is the
		<span class="term">geometric mean</span> of its adjacent terms. Say we had
		the geometric sequence ${\lang x, y, z \rang.}$ From the definition of a
		geometric sequence, it follows that:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{z}{y}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		It then follows that ${y^2 =xz.}$ Accordingly, ${y = \pm \sqrt{xz}.}$ The
		expression ${\sqrt{xz}}$ is the
		<span class="italicsText">geometric mean</span> of ${x}$ and ${z,}$ the two
		terms adjacent to ${y.}$
	</p>

	<h3>General Term Formula</h3>
	<p>
		Let's say the initial term of a geometric sequence is ${u_0,}$ and the
		common ratio is ${r.}$ It follows that:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} u_1 &= u_0r \\[1em] u_2 &= u_0r^2 \\[1em] u_3 &= u_0r^3
			\\[1em] u_4 &= u_0r^4 \\[1em] \vdots \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Like the arithmetic sequence, we can generalize this pattern into a formula.
		The ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term of a geometric sequence is given by:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${u_n = u_0r^n}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Here, ${n \in \N,}$ and ${u_n}$ is the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term.
		${n}$ is the index of the term, ${u_0}$ is the initial term, and ${r}$ is
		the common ratio.
		<label for="aside3" class="margin-toggle"><sup></sup></label>
		<input type="checkbox" id="aside3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" />

<section id="harmonic_sequence">
	<h2>Harmonic Sequences</h2>
	<p>Earlier, we introduced the following sequence:</p>

				${\lang 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \ldots

	<p>This is an example of a <span class="term">harmonic sequence</span>.</p>

<section id="recurrence_relations">
	<h2>Recurrence Relations</h2>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">recurrence relation</span> (or
		<span class="italicsText">recurrence formula</span>) is an equation that
		describes the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term of a sequence by using the
		preceding terms. Accordingly, every recurrence formula must specify the
		initial terms necessary for the formula to begin with. For example, to
		denote the sequence ${4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \ldots}$ we can write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${u_0 = 4, u_n = u_{n-1} + 3, n > 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Recurrence relations are the bedrock of
		<span class="term">recursion</span> in programming. Indeed, understanding
		recursion is a natural consequence of understanding recurrence relations.
		Let's state the formal definition of a recurrence relation:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="italicsText">recurrence relation</span> for a given
				sequence ${\lang u_n \rang}$ is an equation that expresses ${\lang u_n
				\rang}$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence;
				i.e., ${u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{n-1},}$ where ${n \in \N.}$ The sequence
				${\lang u_n \rang}$ is a <span class="italicsText">solution</span> of
				the recurrence relation if all its terms satisfy the recurrence
				relation. The recurrence relation
				<span class="italicsText">recursively defines</span> the sequence
				${u_n.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Recurrence relations must always specify
		<span class="term">initial conditions</span>. The initial conditions are the
		premises that must be true before the recurrence relation is found to be
		true or false. For example, consider the sequence ${\lang 1, 3, 9, 27, 81,
		\ldots \rang.}$ This is a geometric sequence, where each term is 3 times the
		previous. We can define this sequence with the following recurrence
		relation:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${u_0 = 1; u_n = u_0(3^n),}$ where ${n \in \N}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In this case, the initial condition is ${u_0 = 1.}$ In other words, the
		initial term in the sequence is 1. This must be stated for the recurrence
		relation to be properly interpreted; otherwise, ${u_0}$ could be any number,
		in which case it would be not correctly define the sequence.
	</p>

	<h3>Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
	<p>
		A recurrence relation can have multiple initial conditions. Take for example
		a particularly useful structure, the
		<span class="term">Fibonacci sequence</span>. We will repeatedly see this
		sequence throughout the other volumes, so it's worth pointing out at this
		juncture. Moreover, it lends itself well to a recursive definition.
	</p>
	<p>The Fibonacci sequence looks like this:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lang 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \ldots \rang}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice a pattern? Each term in the sequence is the sum of the two previous
		terms, <span class="underlineText">starting from 0 and 1</span>. We
		underline the preceding clause because it evidences two initial conditions.
