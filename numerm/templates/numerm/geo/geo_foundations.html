<h1>Geometry: Foundations</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">W</span>e begin by introducing the foundations of
		classical geometry. These foundations underlie all of the axioms, lemmas,
		theorems, and corollaries to come. As one of the oldest fields, some of
		these foundational propositions appear overly simplistic, trivial, or
		elementary. And indeed, they often are. Classical geometry's beauty,
		however, sprouts from these humble seedlings &mdash; from the trivial and
		mundane erupts awe and peculiarity. Recognizing this beauty, we will
		steadily appreciate why early mathematicians equated the field with
		mysticism and the divine.

<section id="sets_of_points">
	<h2>Points</h2>
	<p>
		The fundamental geometric object is the <span class="term">point</span>.
		It's often depicted as a small black dot, but in geometry, a point has no
		size. It has a location, but no length, width, height, depth, or any other
		property we attribute to &#8220;size.&#8221;. It only has a location.
		<span class="term">sets of points</span> form geometric objects. Or, put
		another way, geometric objects are sets of points.
	</p>
	<p>
		When several points appear together, a <span class="term">path</span> may or
		may not be formed. For example, the red and blue points below form paths,
		but the orange points do not:
	</p>
	<figure>

			src="{% static 'images/path_vs_no_path.svg' %}"
			alt="two paths and a no path"
			loading="lazy"
			class="eighty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When an infinite number of points follow a straight path, we have a
		<span class="term">line</span>. Tying back to the set theory interpretation,
		a line is an infinite set of points, and we denote the set by picking two
		arbitrary points on the line, name them (say, ${A}$ and ${B}$), and write:
		${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB.}}$ Alternatively, we can denote the line with
		single variable, such as ${\ell.}$
	</p>

		<img
			src="{% static 'images/line_AB.svg' %}"
			alt="line AB"
			loading="lazy"
			class="sixty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>The line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When an infinite number of points follows a straight path from a discrete
		point (i.e., a particular location), we have a
		<span class="term">ray</span>. Like the line, a ray is an infinite set of
		points, but with the added feature that it has a starting point. Also like
		the line, we denote a ray by naming the starting point (say ${A}$) and some
		arbitrary point on the line (say ${B}$), and writing: ${\overrightarrow{\rm
		AB.}}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/ray_AB.svg' %}"
			alt="Ray AB"
			loading="lazy"
			class="thirty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>The ray ${\overrightarrow{\rm AB.}}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		When we have infinitely many points between one discrete point, call it
		${A,}$ and another discrete point, call it ${B,}$ we have a
		<span class="term">line segment</span>, denoted ${\overline{\rm AB.}}$ The
		points ${A}$ and ${B}$ are called <span class="term">endpoints</span>, of
		${\overline{\rm AB.}}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/line_segment_AC.svg' %}"
			alt="Line segment AB"
			loading="lazy"
			class="fifty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>The line segment ${\overline{\rm AB}}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Unlike lines and rays, line segments have a
		<span class="term">length</span> property: The
		<span class="term">distance</span> between the two endpoints, ${A}$ and
		${B.}$ We denote this length as ${\lvert AB \rvert.}$ We can determine the
		length of ${\overline{\rm AB}}$ by pairing each of ${A}$ and ${B}$ to a
		number on the number line. For example, if the location of ${A}$ is ${0}$
		and the location of ${B}$ is ${7,}$ then:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\lvert AB \rvert =\lvert 1 - 1 \rvert = 6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The notion of <span class="italicsText">distance</span> stems from the
		<span class="italicsText">Distance Postulate</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Distance Postulate.</span> Given any pair of
				distinct points, there corresponds a unique ${d \in \R^+}$ called the
				<span class="italicsText">distance</span> between the two points.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We can pair ${A}$ and ${B}$ to points on a number line because of the
		<span class="italicsText">Ruler Postulate</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Ruler Postulate.</span> The points on a line can be
				placed in a correspondence such that:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of points on the
					line and the set of real numbers, and
				</li>
				<li>
					the distance between two points is the absolute value of the
					difference of the corresponding numbers.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The definition above is just a formal way of saying that we can pair each
		point on a line with a real number, and use that real number as a means of
		recording <span class="italicsText">location</span> (recall that every point
		has a location). Closely related to the notion of distance, we have the
		following postulate for the distances between multiple points:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Segment Addition Postulate.</span> If ${B}$ is
				between ${A}$ and ${C,}$ then:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${\lvert AB \rvert + \lvert BC \rvert =\lvert AC \rvert. }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If two segments have the same lengths, we say the segments are
		<span class="term">congruent</span>. For example, if ${\overline{\rm AB}}$
		has the same length as ${\overline{\rm CD},}$ we write:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\overline{\rm AB} = \overline{\rm BC}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The property of congruency extends to other geometric objects. Objects of
		the same size and shape are called congruent. Later, we'll see that many of
		these objects have specific criteria for congruency. From congruency, we
		have the concept of a <span class="term">midpoint</span>. A midpoint is the
		point on a line segment that divides the line segment into two congruent
		line segments. For example, in the line segment below, the point ${M}$ is
		the midpoint:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/midpoint.svg' %}"
			alt="Midpoint M"
			loading="lazy"
			class="eighty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we draw a line, segment, ray, or a plane through the midpoint, we say
		that the object is a <span class="term">bisector</span> of the segment.
	</p>

<section id="angles">
	<h2>Angles</h2>
	<p>
		An <span class="term">angle</span> is a geometric object formed by two rays
		originating in the same endpoint. The two rays are called the
		<span class="term">sides</span> of the angle, and their common endpoint is
		called the <span class="term">vertex</span> of the angle.
