	<h4>Open Sentences</h4>
	<p>Consider the following:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${1 + x = 4}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The above is clearly an equation, but more broadly, it is called an
		<span class="term">open sentence</span> &mdash; a statement that contains a
		variable, and becomes a proposition when an element of the universal set is
		substituted for the variable. In this case, the universal set is the set of
		all real numbers, ${\R.}$ If we substitute ${1,}$ an element of the
		universal set, into the variable, we obtain ${1 + 1 = 2,}$ a false
		proposition. But, if we instead substituted 3, another element of the
		universal set, we obtain ${1 + 3 = 4,}$ a true proposition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like propostions, we denote open sentences with lower-case letters, with the
		one key difference &mdash; there is a subscript appended, corresponding to
		the variables used in the open sentence. For example, the open sentence
		above might be denoted ${p_x.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The rule of substituting remains applicable for variables that occur more
		than once in the sentence:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${1 + x + x = 2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To return a true proposition for the sentence above, we must substitute a
		value into each ${x}$ in the open sentence.
	</p>
	<p>
		We call these statements open sentences because they are in fact sentences.
		Equations, at the end of the day, are simply sentences. The equation ${2x =
		3}$ is just another way of saying, &#8220;Two multiplied by some value is
		three.&#8221; The use of the symbols 2, ${x,}$ ${=,}$ and ${3,}$ and
		arranging those symbols in a particular way, is nothing more than a means of
		making things more concise and easier to read. Mathematicians invent and use
		symbols because certain propositions cannot be expressed concisely and
		clearly in plain English:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				$$\int_0^{3.8}\frac{\pi^4 x y (a+9 c+8 b \cos(\frac{\pi z}{l})+18 c
				\cos(\frac{2 \pi z}{l})) \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{l})}{l^4} dz$$
			</p>

				<span class="italicsText"
					>&#8220;The ingegral with respect to ${z}$ from 0 to 3.8 of the
					quotient of the product of the product of the fourth power of Pi,
					${x,}$ and ${y}$ multiplied by the sum of ${a,}$ the product of ${8,}$
					${b,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of the product of Pi and ${z}$
					divided by ${l,}$ the product of ${18,}$ ${c,}$ and the cosine of the
					quotient of 2, Pi, and ${z,}$ and the square of the sine of the
					quotient of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ all divided by the the
					fourth power of ${l.}$&#8221;</span
