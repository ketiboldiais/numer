<h1>Trees</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		Closely related to graphs are <b>trees</b>. Before we get to trees,
		however, we should state some definitions. First, given a non-empty
		graph, a <b>walk</b> is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. For
		example, here's a walk:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/walk.svg' %}"
			alt="a walk"
			width="25px"
			height="25px"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We start at some vertex ${v_0,}$ then walk to ${v_1,}$ then ${v_2,}$
		all the way up to ${v_k,}$ where ${k}$ is the <i>length</i> of the
		walk.
	</p>
	<p>
		The walk is a very simple notion. What's much interesting is the
		<b>path</b>. A <i>path</i> is simply a special kind of walk &mdash; one
		where each vertex along the walk is different. For example, consider
		the following graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/path.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			width="400px"
			height="400px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Suppose we're trying to get from the node ${v_0}$ to the node ${v_7.}$
		In the first approach, we're crossing nodes multiple times. But in the
		second approach, we're crossing each node along the walk exactly once.
		That second approach is called a <i>path</i>. Extending this idea is
		the following lemma:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Lemma</small>
		<p>
			Let ${u}$ and ${v}$ be vertices. If there exists a <i>walk</i> from
			${u}$ to ${v,}$ then there exists a <i>path</i> from ${u}$ to ${v.}$
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		Let's prove this lemma. First, suppose there exists a walk a from ${u}$
		to ${v.}$ Then by the <cite>Well-Ordering Principle</cite><sup></sup>,
		there exists a shortest walk from ${u}$ to ${v.}$ And if there is a
		shortest walk from ${u}$ to ${v,}$ then any vertices along the walk
		from ${u}$ to ${v}$ cannot be removed &mdash; doing so would create a
		shorter walk, which is not possible because there already exists the
		shortest possible walk.
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Recall that the <i>Well-Ordering Principle</i> provides that every
			nonempty subset of the natural numbers ${\N}$ contains a smallest
			element.
		</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="trees">
	<h2>Trees</h2>
	<p>Recall the definition of <i>connected</i> in graph theory:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Definition: Connected</small>
		<p>
			Two vertices ${u}$ and ${v}$ are <i>connected</i> if, and only if,
			there is a path between ${u}$ and ${v.}$ A graph ${G}$ is
			<i>connected</i> when every pair of vertices in the graph are
			connected.
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>Next, recall the definition of a <i>closed walk</i>:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Definition: Closed Walk</small>
		<p>
			A <i>closed walk</i> is a walk which starts and ends with the same
			vertex.
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>And the definition of a <i>cycle</i>:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Definition: Cycle</small>
		<p>
			A <i>cycle</i> is a closed walk of ${k \geq 3}$ vertices, where
			${v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots v_k}$ are all different.
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		From these two definitions, we have the definition of a <b>tree</b>:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Tree</small>
		<p>A <i>tree</i> is a connected and acyclic graph.</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		In other words, if we have a graph all of its vertices are connected
		and there are no cycles, then we have a <i>tree</i>. For example, the
		graphs below are all trees:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/tree_examples.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			height="150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because trees are a particularly special kind of graph, they have a
		large lexicon. First, the notion of a <b>leaf</b>.
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Definition: Leaf</small>
		<p>
			Given a tree ${T,}$ a <i>leaf</i> is a node the tree with a degree of
			${1.}$
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>For example, in the tree below, the leaves are colored green:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/leaf.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			height="150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Trees have a peculiar feature. If we pick any subgraph in the tree,
		we'd find another tree, called a <b>subtree</b>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/subtree.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			height="150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>We'll state this as a lemma:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Subtree Lemma</small>
		<p>Any connected subgraph of a tree is a tree.</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		Why is this lemma true? Because a graph is a tree if, and only if, it
		has no cycles. Let ${T}$ be a tree with a connected subgraph ${t.}$
		Suppose ${t}$ is not a tree. If ${t}$ is not a tree, then ${t}$
		contains a cycle. But since ${t}$ is connected, then the cycle exists
		in ${T.}$ In which case ${T}$ is not a tree. This contradicts our
		initial proposition that ${T}$ is tree, so it must be true that ${t}$
		is a tree. Therefore, any connected subgraph in ${T}$ is a tree.
		${\blacksquare}$

	<section id="trees_and_edges">
		<h3>The Relationship Between Nodes and Edges in Trees</h3>
		<p>
			Another special property associated with trees is the elegant
			relationship between edges and nodes.
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Node-edge Lemma</small>
			<p>If a tree has ${n}$ nodes, then it must have ${n-1}$ edges.</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			This lemma's proof is great illustration of induction. We begin with
			our inductive hypothesis:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<p>
				<small>hypothesis: ${P(n)}$</small>There are ${n-1}$ edges in any
				${n}$-node tree.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>Then we have our base case:</p>
		<dfn>
			<p>
				<small>base case: ${P(1)}$</small>There are ${0}$ edges in any
				${1}$-node tree.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			We know that ${P(1)}$ is true. If there is only one node, then there
			are no edges, since an edge connects two nodes. Now we perform the
			inductive step:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<p>
				<small>inductive step</small>Assume ${P(n)}$ is true. Let ${T}$ be
				a tree with ${n+1}$ nodes.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			We want to use our <cite>hypothesis</cite> somehow, which involves
			${n-1}$ edges. What nodes can we remove from the true such that the
			tree still stays a tree? The leaves. Since a leaf only has a single
			edge connected to it, removing a leaf from the tree does not change
			the tree's classification as a tree. So we continue:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<p>
				Assume ${P(n)}$ is true. Let ${T}$ be a tree with ${n+1}$ nodes.
				Let ${v}$ be a leaf of ${T.}$ If we remove ${v,}$ then we have a
				connected subgraph of ${T.}$ By the
				<cite>subtree lemma</cite>, this connected subgraph is a tree. By
				${P(n),}$ the connected subgraph has ${n-1}$ edges.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			We're almost done. We've managed to prove that ${P(n)}$ is true for
			the subgraph, but the lemma pertains to the tree as a whole. Thus,
			what we now have to do is reconstruct the tree. Since we removed a
			leaf, we must reattach the leaf:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<p>
				Assume ${P(n)}$ is true. Let ${T}$ be a tree with ${n+1}$ nodes.
				Let ${v}$ be a leaf of ${T.}$ If we remove ${v,}$ then we have a
				connected subgraph ${t}$ of ${T.}$ By the
				<cite>subtree lemma</cite>, ${t}$ is a tree. By ${P(n),}$ ${t}$ has
				${n-1}$ edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppose ${v}$ is reattached. This adds an additional edge to ${t}$
				and returns the original tree ${T.}$ Given that ${t}$ had ${n-1}$
				edges, ${T}$ has: ${(n-1)+1 = n}$ edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, if a tree ${T}$ has ${n}$ nodes, then it must have
				${n-1}$ edges. ${\blacksquare}$
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			This proves the <cite>node-edge lemma</cite>, a proposition that
			turns out to be very useful when handling trees.

		<h3>Spanning Trees</h3>
		<p>
			A <b>spanning tree</b> is a subgraph of a graph that <i>spans</i> all
			the vertices within the graph. In other words, a tree that touches
			every single vertex in the graph. For example, the
			<i>grid graph</i> below contains a spanning tree:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/spanning_tree.svg' %}"
				alt=""
				loading="lazy"
				height="100px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>The definition:</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Definition: Spanning Tree</small>
			<p>
				Let ${G}$ be a connected graph, and ${ST}$ be a subgraph of ${G.}$
				If, and only if, ${ST}$ is:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>a tree, and</li>
				<li>has the same vertices as ${G,}$</li>
			</ol>
			<p>then ${ST}$ is a <i>spanning tree</i>.</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			Another way to think about this is, if we can take a connected graph
			${G}$ and reconstruct it as a tree using all of ${G}$'s vertices,
			then ${G}$ has a spanning tree. As it happens, there's a powerful
			theorem related to spanning trees:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Spanning Tree Theorem</small>
			<p>Any connected graph ${G}$ has a spanning tree.</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			The proof for this theorem is done by contradiction. Suppose there
			exists a connected graph ${G}$ with no spanning tree. Since ${G}$ is
			a connected graph, ${G}$ contains a subgraph with the same nodes and
			the smallest number of edges. Suppose that ${T}$ is such a graph: Let
			${T}$ be a connected subgraph of ${G}$ with (1) the same nodes as
			${G}$ and (2) the smallest number of edges. Since ${G}$ has no
			spanning tree, ${T}$ is not a spanning tree. Because ${T}$ has the
			same nodes as ${G}$ and the smallest number of edges, the fact that
			${T}$ is not a spanning tree implies that ${T}$ contains a cycle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now suppose that an edge ${(n_0, n_1)}$ is removed from the graph
			${G.}$ If some path ${(x, \ldots, y)}$ in ${G}$ does not contain the
			edge ${(n_0, n_1),}$ then ${x}$ and ${y}$ remain connected. However,
			even if the path ${(x, \ldots, y)}$ contained the edge ${(n_0,
			n_1),}$ i.e., the path ${(x, \ldots, n_0, n_1, \ldots, y),}$ the
			nodes ${x}$ and ${y}$ remain connected because ${G}$ contains a
			cycle. Thus, even if some edge ${e_n}$ is removed from ${G,}$ all
			vertices in ${G}$ remain connected.
		</p>
		<p>
			This implies that ${G}$ contains a smaller subgraph than ${T,}$ which
			contradicts the assumption that ${T}$ is the smallest subgraph.
			Therefore, it cannot be true that ${T}$ is not a spanning tree, which
			proves that every connected graph ${G}$ has a spanning tree.

		<h3>Minimimum Weight Spanning Trees</h3>
		<p>
			Just as we saw with other graphs, we can assign weights to spanning
			trees:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/weighted_spanning_tree.svg' %}"
				alt=""
				loading="lazy"
				height="150px"
			/>
			<figcaption>Graph ${L}$</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>The spanning tree in ${L}$ is visualized as such:</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/weighted_spanning_tree1.svg' %}"
				alt=""
				loading="lazy"
				height="150px"
			/>
			<figcaption>Spanning tree of ${L,}$ denoted ${L_{ST}}$</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The <b>spanning tree weight</b> is the weight of all the edges in the
			spanning tree. In the case of ${L_{ST},}$ the graph ${L}$'s spanning
			tree, we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \mathcal{W}(L_{ST}) = 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 19 $$
		</figure>
		<p>From these basic facts, we have the following problem:</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</small>
			<p>
				Given a connected graph ${G,}$ how do we find a spanning tree of
				${G}$ with the smallest weight possible?
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			For example, if we look at the original spanning tree we constructed,
			we could have instead constructed:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/weighted_spanning_tree2.svg' %}"
				alt=""
				loading="lazy"
				height="150px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			This replaces the edge with a weight ${2}$ with the edge of weight
			${1,}$ which would then yield:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \mathcal{W}(L_{ST}) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 17 $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			It turns out that ${17}$ is the smallest possible weight for
			${L_{ST},}$ so we'll use a similar tree for illustration still of
			weight ${17:}$
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/weighted_spanning_tree3.svg' %}"
				alt=""
				loading="lazy"
				height="150px"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>Let's start with a definition:</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Definition: Minimum Spanning Tree</small>
			<p>
				The <i>minimum spanning tree</i> of an edge-weighted graph ${G}$ is
				the spanning tree of ${G}$ such that it has the smallest possible
				sum of ${G}$'s edge weights.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			We'll start with a simple greedy algorithm for finding a graph
			${G}$'s minimum spanning tree:
		</p>
		<dfn>
			<small>Greedy Minimum Spanning Tree Finder</small>
			<p>
				Let ${G}$ be an edge-weighted graph. To find ${G}$'s minimum
				spanning tree, we grow a subgraph of ${G}$ one edge at a time, such
				that each step, we add the minimum weight edge that keeps the
				subgraph acyclic.
			</p>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			The greedy algorithm is straightforward. We start with any minimum
			edge, say, the edge ${(c, b).}$ With just one edge, we're free to
			choose any other edge. In this case, say we choose ${(x,y).}$ Doing
			so again doesn't cause any problems. The edges ${(c,b)}$ and
			${(x,y)}$ are disjoint, so there's no graph formation. Accordingly,
			we have the following so far:
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Edge Chosen</th>
				<th>Weight</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${(c, b)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(x, y)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			Since no graph has formed, we're free to pick any other edge. Say we
			pick ${(d, b):}$
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Edge Chosen</th>
				<th>Weight</th>
				<th>Total Weight</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${(c, b)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(x, y)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(d, b)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>
			Now we have our first subgraph: ${(c, b, d).}$ We cannot use the edge
			${(c, d),}$ since that would create a cycle, so let's say we chose
			the edge ${(w, x):}$
		</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Edge Chosen</th>
				<th>Weight</th>
				<th>Total Weight</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${(c, b)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(x, y)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(b, d)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(w, x)}$</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>5</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>Thus far, we now have two disconnected subgraphs:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} &(c, b, d) \\ &(w, x, y) \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Let's connect the two subgraphs by adding the edge ${(w, d):}$</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Edge Chosen</th>
				<th>Weight</th>
				<th>Total Weight</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${(c, b)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(x, y)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(b, d)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(w, x)}$</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(w, d)}$</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>7</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>At this point we have a single subgraph:</p>
		<figure>$$ (c, b, d, w, x, y) $$</figure>
		<p>All that's remaining is to connect the nodes ${z}$ and ${a:}$</p>
		<table class="alg">
			<thead>
				<th>Edge Chosen</th>
				<th>Weight</th>
				<th>Total Weight</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${(c, b)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(x, y)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(b, d)}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(w, x)}$</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(w, d)}$</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>7</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(y, z)}$</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>10</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${(b, a)}$</td>
					<td>7</td>
					<td>17</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
