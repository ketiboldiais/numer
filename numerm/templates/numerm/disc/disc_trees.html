<h1>Trees</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		Closely related to graphs are <b>trees</b>. Before we get to trees,
		however, we should state some definitions. First, given a non-empty
		graph, a <b>walk</b> is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. For
		example, here's a walk:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/walk.svg' %}"
			alt="a walk"
			width="25px"
			height="25px"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We start at some vertex ${v_0,}$ then walk to ${v_1,}$ then ${v_2,}$
		all the way up to ${v_k,}$ where ${k}$ is the <i>length</i> of the
		walk.
	</p>
	<p>
		The walk is a very simple notion. What's much interesting is the
		<b>path</b>. A <i>path</i> is simply a special kind of walk &mdash; one
		where each vertex along the walk is different. For example, consider
		the following graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/path.svg' %}"
			alt=""
			loading="lazy"
			width="400px"
			height="400px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Suppose we're trying to get from the node ${v_0}$ to the node ${v_7.}$
		In the first approach, we're crossing nodes multiple times. But in the
		second approach, we're crossing each node along the walk exactly once.
		That second approach is called a <i>path</i>. Extending this idea is
		the following lemma:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Lemma</small>
		<p>
			Let ${u}$ and ${v}$ be vertices. If there exists a <i>walk</i> from
			${u}$ to ${v,}$ then there exists a <i>path</i> from ${u}$ to ${v.}$
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		Let's prove this lemma. First, suppose there exists a walk a from ${u}$
		to ${v.}$ Then by the <cite>Well-Ordering Principle</cite><sup></sup>,
		there exists a shortest walk from ${u}$ to ${v.}$ And if there is a
		shortest walk from ${u}$ to ${v,}$ then any vertices along the walk
		from ${u}$ to ${v}$ cannot be removed &mdash; doing so would create a
		shorter walk, which is not possible because there already exists the
		shortest possible walk.
	</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p>
			Recall that the <i>Well-Ordering Principle</i> provides that every
			nonempty subset of the natural numbers ${\N}$ contains a smallest
			element.
