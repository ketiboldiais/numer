<section id="intro">
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			John plays a video game where there are 50 characters to chose from.
			John must construct a team of characters. The team can only consist
			of 5 unique characters, selected from the 50 characters. How many

	<p>
		This is an example of a
		<span class="term">combinatorics</span> problem. Combinatorics is the
		study of <span class="italicsText">combinations</span>, or
		<span class="italicsText">arrangements</span>, of discrete objects. By
		and large, questions in combinatorics fall into a few categories:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<span class="topic">Existence.</span> Given some things and a set of
			conditions, does a particular arrangement ${x}$ exist?
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="topic">Enumeration.</span> How many different ways are
			there to arrange these things given this set of conditions?
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="topic">Analysis.</span> What are the properties, or
			characteristics, of this particular arrangement?
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="topic">Optimization.</span> Given all these different
			arrangements, what is the most optimal?
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Not every combinatorics problem falls into the categories above, and of
		those that do, they may not fit so neatly. The categorization presented
		is intended to be illustrative, rather than comprehensive. However,
		many of the most useful ideas in combinatorics stem from the
		aforementioned questions, and it is these ideas that we explore.
		Accordingly, for our purposes, combinatorics is the study of the
		existence, enumeration, analysis, and optimization of arranging
		discrete objects.

	<h2>Review of Induction</h2>
	<p>
		Before we examine more substantive material, it's worth reviewing
		mathematical induction, given how it forms the basis for many proofs in
		combinatorics.
	</p>
	<p>
		A good illustration of induction is the sinking of the titanic. The
		titanic was a large cruise ship with bulkheads separated into sections.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/titanic_bulkheads.svg' %}"
			alt="Titanic bulkheads"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 260px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>Symbolically, we denote these sections as:</p>
	$$ (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P) $$
	<p>
		The idea was that, if there were separate sections, if one or two would
		flood, the remaining would be left unflooded. When the titanic struck
		the ice berg, water flooded the sections towards the front:
	</p>
	$$ (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O,
	\textcolor{cornflowerblue} P) $$
	<p>
		Unfortunately, the barriers between each of these sections weren't
		completely sealed, so water began leaking into the next sections:
	</p>
	$$ (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, \textcolor{cornflowerblue}
	O, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} P) $$
	<p>Then the next:</p>
	$$ (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} N,
	\textcolor{cornflowerblue} O, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} P) $$
	<p>And then the next:</p>
	$$ (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} M,
	\textcolor{cornflowerblue} N, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} O,
	\textcolor{cornflowerblue} P) $$
	<p>Eventually flooding all of the sections:</p>
	$$ \textcolor{cornflowerblue} {(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,
	\textcolor{cornflowerblue} M, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} N,
	\textcolor{cornflowerblue} O, \textcolor{cornflowerblue} P)} $$
	<p>
		This illustrates the principle of induction. From the fact that the
		first ${n}$ sections flood, it follows that the ${n+1}$ sections will
		also flood.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Towers of Hanoi.</span> We can apply the principle
		of induction to the towers of hanoi problem:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem: Towers of Hanoi</small>
		<p>
			There are three pegs, one of which holds ${n}$ disks. All disks on
			such a peg must have smaller ones on top &mdash; i.e., no disk ${d}$
			can lie atop a disk smaller than ${d.}$ The disks can only moved one
			at a time. Is it possible to move ${n}$ disks from the starting peg
			to the final, third peg?
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/towers_of_hanoi_simple.svg' %}"
				alt="Towers of Hanoi"
				loading="lazy"
			/>
		</figure>
	</dfn>
	<p>Suppose we modeled the initial state as follows:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & d_0 \\ & d_1 \\
		& d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${p}$ is a peg, and ${d}$ is a disk, ${d_0}$ being the smallest.
		Let's start with the simplest case, where we only have one disc &mdash;
		${d_0:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & d_0 \\
		\end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		To move this disc to the next peg, we simply take it and put it on the
		next peg:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & d_0 \\
		\end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>then put it on the next peg:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & & d_0 \\
		\end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>We'll write this step down as:</p>
	<figure>$$ M_1(d_0) = R_1(d_0), R_1(d_0) $$</figure>
	<p>
		where ${R_1}$ means move ${1}$ right, and ${M_1}$ means move ${1}$
		disc.
	</p>
	<p>What if we had two discs:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & d_0 \\ & d_1 \\
		\end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>For this we start by moving the first disc to ${p_2:}$</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & d_0 \\ & d_1
		\\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then we move the second disc all the way to the right:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & d_0 \\ & & &
		d_1 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then move ${d_0}$ to the right:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & & d_0 \\ & &
		& d_1 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>The steps are thus:</p>
	<figure>$$ M_2 = R_1(d_0), M_1(d_1), R_1(d_0) $$</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, we have a procedure for moving two discs. What if we had three
		discs:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & d_0 \\ & d_1 \\
		& d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		This one takes a bit more thinking, but fortunately we already have
		some procedures to help us. We start by performing ${M_2}$ to move the
		two discs all the way to the right:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & & d_0 \\ & &
		& d_1 \\ & d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then we move the third disc over:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & & d_0 \\ & &
		& d_1 \\ & & d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then we move the first disc all the way to the left:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & d_0 \\ & & &
		d_1 \\ & & d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then then second disk one step to the left:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & d_0 \\ & & d_1
		\\ & & d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Then we move ${d_0}$ one step to the right:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & d_0 \\ & &
		d_1 \\ & & d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Repeating this process one more time moves all of the discs to the last
		peg:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c:c} & p_1 & p_2 & p_3 \\ \hline & & & d_0 \\ & &
		& d_1 \\ & & & d_2 \\ \end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we can define this procedure as:</p>
	$$ M_3 = M_2, R_1(d_2), L_2(d_0), L_1(d_1), R_1(d_0) $$
	<p>
		Once we get to ${4}$ disks, things start getting very complicated.
		Fortunately, there's an easy solution. We know how to move three disks,
		so what we can do is just pretend the fourth disk doesn't exist, and
		just perform ${M_3:}$
	</p>
	<figure>$$ M_4 = M_3, R_1(d_3), M_3 $$</figure>
	<p>And if we had ${5}$ disks, we simply use ${M_4:}$</p>
	<figure>$$ M_5 = M_4, R_1(d_4), M_4 $$</figure>
	<p>
		Examining this problem, we see that is, in fact, possible to move ${n}$
		disks from their initial peg to the final peg. Let's circle back to see
		what we needed to prove this:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We needed to know that we can do it for ${1}$ disk.</li>
		<li>
			We needed to know that if we can move ${n}$ disks, we can move
			${n+1}$ disks.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		This is how mathematical induction works. We start with a base case
		&mdash; ${1}$ disk, which we denote as ${P(1).}$ Then we stated an
		induction hypothesis: If we can move ${n}$ disks, we can move ${n+1}$
		disks. We denote this symbolically as ${P(n) \implies P(n+1).}$ Then we
		supposed that ${P(n)}$ is true, and verified that ${P(n+1)}$ is true.
		Once we've proven that ${P(n+1)}$ is true, it follows that ${P(n)
		\implies P(n+1)}$ is true, because a conditional statement is false
		only if ${P(n)}$ is true and ${P(n+1)}$ is false.
	</p>
	<p>Mathematical induction is enapsulated as such:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Mathematical Induction</small>
		<p>Suppose we seek to prove a sequence of statements:</p>
		<figure>$$ S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots, S_n, S_{n+1}, \ldots $$</figure>
		<p>
			The principle of mathematical induction provides that the sequence of
			statements can be proved by showing that:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>${S_1}$ is true.</li>
			<li>For all ${n}$ where ${S_n}$ is true, ${S_{n+1}}$ is true.</li>
		</ol>

<section id="enumeration">
	<h2>Enumeration</h2>
	<p>
		In these next few sections, we explore the basics of
		<span class="italicsText">enumeration</span>, the formal term for what
		we think of when we hear the word &#8220;counting.&#8221; The concept
		of counting things might seem intuitive, but looks can be deceiving.
		Many counting problems require us to first determine (a)
		<span class="italicsText">what</span> exactly it is we are counting,
		and (b) <span class="italicsText">how</span> we should count. It is
		these problems that concern the next sections.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose on August 1, a friend says, &#8220;We'll meet in a
		week.&#8221; Does the friend mean, August 7 or August 8? Both meanings
		are plausible. If we count August 1, then:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>If, however, we do not count August 1, then:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of what we call an
		<span class="term">indexing problem</span> &mdash; where do we start
		the count? In reality, indexing depends enormously on convention. In
		the English-speaking world, if at 10:00 a.m. the lecturer says,
		&#8220;We'll meet again in 2 hours&#8221; they almost assuredly mean,
		&#8220;Reconvene at 12:00 p.m.&#8221;
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[10, 11, 12]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At its core, every counting issue boils down to a deceptively simple
		question: &#8220;What do we count?&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		In many programming languages, if an array contains 4 elements, then
		the third element in the array is actually element number 2, because
		the count starts at 0:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<p>How many numbers are in this sequence:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Clearly, there are 10 numbers. This is a very basic counting problem,
		and it is what we think of when hear the word &#8220;counting&#8221;.
		Now, how many numbers are between 8 and 16 inclusive (i.e., including 8
		and 16)?:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We could manually count each element. But, that approach is
		inefficient, particularly for very long sequences. A better way would
		be to simplify sequence into the one we saw previously:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (8-7) &= 1, \\ (9-7) &= 2, \\ (10-7) &= 3, \\ (11-7)
		&= 4, \\ (12-7) &= 5, \\ (13-7) &= 6, \\ (14-7) &= 7, \\ (15-7) &= 8,
		\\ (16-7) &= 9, \\ \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		From this approach, we can see that given two positive numbers ${a}$
		and ${b}$ where ${b > a,}$ the number of integers in the sequence ${[a,
		a+1, \ldots, b-1, b]}$ is: ${(b - a) + 1.}$
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proposition.</span> Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be
			integers, where ${b > a.}$ Given a sequence ${L = [a, a+1, \ldots,
			b-1, b],}$ the number of elements in the sequence, ${n(L),}$ is given
			by:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${n(L) = (b - a) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<p>
		We can use the proposition above for even more complex problems. For
		example, how many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, we know the first multiple of three between 62 and 215 is 63. The
		last multiple of three is 213. Thus, the actual array we want to count
		is ${63, 66, 69, \ldots, 213.}$ Now, we need to convert this array into
		one we know how to count, so we divide each element in the array by 3:
		${21, 22, 23, \ldots , 71.}$ From our previous proposition, we know how
		to count this array: ${(71 - 21) + 1 = 51.}$ Thus, there are 51 numbers
		in the array &mdash; i.e., there are 51 multiples of 3 between 62 and
		215.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's try another one. How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101?
		Again, the first multiple of 10 is 10. The last multiple of 10 is 100.
		Thus, the sequence is ${[10, 20, \ldots, 100].}$ We divide by 10: ${[1,
		2, 3, \ldots, 10].}$ And again, we know how to count this sequence:
		${(10 - 1) + 1 = 10.}$ There are 10 multiples of 10 between 9 and 101.
	</p>
	<p>
		How many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103? Here, the first
		multiple of 10 is 20. The last multiple of 10 is 100. We have the
		sequence ${[20, 30, \ldots, 100].}$ Dividing by 3: ${[2, 3, 4, \ldots,
		10.]}$ Then counting: ${(10-2) + 1 = 9.}$ There are 9 multiples of 10
		between 11 and 103.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that we know how to count multiples, we can start counting even
		more elaborate sequences: How many four-digit positive integers are
		perfect cubes?
	</p>
	<p>
		Solution: We know that the first four-digit positive integer that is a
		perfect cube is ${10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000.}$ The last four-digit
		perfect cube is a bit trickier to find. Fortunately, the method of
		exhaustion is feasible here. We know ${20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 8000.}$
		This is already pretty close to five-digits, so let's just try the next
		positive integer: ${21 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 = 9,261.}$ Now we're very
		close; 22 will probably enter five-digit territory: ${22 \cdot 22 \cdot
		22 = 10,648.}$ Great, so we know our sequence is ${[1000, \ldots,
		9261].}$ Taking the cubic root of each element, we have ${[10, \ldots,
		21.]}$ Counting this list: ${(21 - 10) + 1 = 12.}$ Hence, there are 12
		four-digit positive integers that are perfect cubes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's consider another interesting example. There are four villages,
		${A,}$ ${B,}$ ${C,}$ and ${D.}$ Each line represents a path between the
		villages. How many ways are there to go from ${A}$ to ${D}$ along the
		paths, if one can only move left to right? (I.e., one cannot move
		${ABABABACD;}$ only ${ACD}$ or ${ABD}$).
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/counting_graph.svg' %}"
			alt="4 nodes, 4 edges"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 150px"
		/>
		<figcaption>Note the arrows.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is another counting problem. First, observe the number of paths
		between each village. Between ${A}$ and ${C,}$ there are 2 paths, and
		between ${A}$ and ${C,}$ there are 5 paths. Accordingly, there are 10
		possible paths if we take the route ${ACD.}$ Now consider the route
		${ABD.}$ From ${A}$ to ${B,}$ there are 4 possible paths, and from
		${B}$ to ${D,}$ there are 3 possible paths. Hence, there are 12
		possible paths for taking the route ${ABD.}$ In total, there are ${10 +
		12 = 22}$ possible paths from ${A}$ to ${D.}$

							We can see each element differs by ${\frac{2}{3}.}$ Let's try

						higher. ${13^2 = 169.}$ ${15 \times 15 = 225;}$ too high.
						${14^2 = 196,}$ but this is even. So, the first element is 9,
						and the last element is 169. Thus, we have ${[9, 25, 49, 81,
						\ldots 196].}$ Taking the square root each element: ${[3, 5, 7,
						9, \ldots , 13.]}$ Subtracting 1 from each element: ${[2, 4, 6,
						8, \ldots , 12.]}$ Dividing each element by 2: ${[1, 2, 3, 4,
						\ldots, 6.]}$ Thus, there are 6 odd perfect squares between 5
						and 211.

				How many sets of four consecutive positive integers are there such
				that the product of the four integers is less than 100,000?
				<details class="answer">
					<summary>Solution</summary>
					<p>
						First, the smallest element in this sequence is ${[1, 2, 3, 4]
						= 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24}$ (remember, we're looking for
						consecutive positive integers). Now, we have to look for the
						largest set. Let's focus on the value 100,000.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're looking for four numbers that when multiplied together
						produce 100,000. Let's look at a simpler case, a number to the
						power of 4. We know that ${20^4 = 160,000.}$ Let's try another
						number: ${19^4 = 130,321.}$ Getting a little closer. ${18^4 =
						104,976.}$ This is pretty close, so the last number has to be
						immediately next to 18. Let's try another one: ${17^4 =
						83,521.}$ This is lower than 100,000. This means the set of
						four integers is somewhere in the vicinity of 17 and 18. Let's
						try: ${15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 = 73,440.}$ Close, but
						let's just try one more: ${16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 =
						93,024;}$ include 20 in the next set and we are definitely over
						100,000. Thus, this is definitely the last element. Great, this
						means we have the following:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<div>
							<p>${M = [\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \ldots, \{16, 17, 18, 19\}]}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Now, the question is how do we count these? Well, let's think
						about how each of these sets work:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<div>
							<p>${ \{ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \} }$</p>
							<p>${\vdots}$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 \} }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						If we focus on just the first number for each of the sets
						above, we get: ${1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 15, 16.}$ Thus, there are
						16 different possible sets.

		Counting is deeply intertwined with arithmetic. Consider the following
		problem:
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			12 students are taking at least 1 foreign language. The school offers
			only Spanish and French. 8 students take Spanish, 5 take both Spanish
			and French. How many students take French?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but the worst
		possible way is to blindly add and subtract. We want to think as
		logically as possible. More importantly, we want to think about this
		problem in terms of set theory. Here, we have a situation where
		students take Spanish, French, or both Spanish and French. The problem
		can be viewed as sets intersecting, where ${F = \text{French},}$ ${S =
		\text{Spanish}:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/french_and_spanish.svg' %}"
			alt="int"
			loading="lazy"
			style="width: 150px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The Venn diagram above can be thought of as representing several
		sections:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${F \cup S}$ = {all students}</p>
			<p>${F}$ = {all French students}</p>
			<p>${S}$ = {all Spanish students}</p>
			<p>${F \cap S}$ = {students taking French and Spanish}</p>
			<p>${F \setminus S}$ = {students taking only French}</p>
			<p>${S \setminus F}$ = {students taking only Spanish}</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here, we are asked to find ${n(F).}$ We have the following data:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(F \cup S) = 12}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 8}$</p>
			<p>${n(F \cap S) = 5}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What else can we infer from this data? Well, we know that ${n(F \cap S)
		= 5.}$ These are the students that take both Spanish and French. Next,
		we know ${n(S) = 8;}$ there are 8 total students taking Spanish. Thus,
		we can make the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \setminus F) = n(S) - n(F \cap S) = 8 - 5 = 3.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, there are 3 students that take only Spanish. How many students
		take only French? Well, it must be 4, since ${n(F \cup S) - n(S) = 12 -
		8 = 4.}$ Hence, ${n(F) = n(F \setminus S) + n(F \cap S) = 4 + 5 = 9.}$
	</p>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			Agnes has 27 cats. 14 cats are short-haired. 11 cats are kittens. 5
			cats are long-haired adult cats (not kittens). How many short-haired
			kittens?
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		Again, set theory allows us to think about this as logically as
		possible. Here, we have several sets from the data above:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${S}$ = short-hairs</p>
			<p>${L}$ = long-hairs</p>
			<p>${K}$ = kittens</p>
			<p>${A}$ = adults</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The problem gives us the following data, and the last line is what we
		want to find:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \cup L) = n(A \cup K)}$ = total cats = 27</p>
			<p>${n(S) = n(K \cup S) + n(A \cup S)}$</p>
			<p>${n(L) = n(K \cup L) + n(A \cup L)}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 14}$</p>
			<p>${n(K) = 11}$</p>
			<p>${n(L \cap A) = 5}$</p>
			<p>${n(K \cap S) = ?}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		First, we know that ${n(K \cup A) = 27.}$ We also know that ${n(K) =
		11.}$ Thus, ${n(A) = n(K \cup A) - n(K) = 27 - 11 = 16.}$ There are 16
		adults.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that ${n(L \cap A) = 5,}$ so ${n(A \cap S) = n(A) - n(A \cap L)
		= 16 - 5 = 11.}$ There are 11 short-hair adults. Now, we know ${n(S) =
		14,}$ and we know that ${n(S) = n(K \cap S) + n(A \cap S).}$ Hence,
		${n(K \cap S) = n(S) - n(A \cap S) = 14 - 11 = 3.}$ Therefore, there
		are 3 short-hair kittens.

						When dealing with problems involving abstractions, it's often

	<h2>Using the Sum & Product Rules Together</h2>
	<p>
		While the sum and product rules are useful tools for counting, they are
		limited. Often, a counting problem requires using both rules for a
		solution. For example, consider the following problem:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			A computer language ${X}$ permits variable names according to the
			following rules:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The variable name is a string of one or two alphanumeric characters
				(an
				<span class="italicsText">alphanumeric character</span> is a
				character that is either one of the 26 English letters or one of
				the 10 digits).
			</li>
			<li>Uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished.</li>
			<li>The variable name must begin with a letter.</li>
			<li>
				The variable name must not be one of the five strings of two
				characters reserved by the language.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>How many different variable names are possible in ${X?}$</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		Solving this problem requires applying both the sum and product rules.
		First, let's denote the set of all possible variable names as ${V.}$
		The set ${V}$ consists of two subsets: ${V_1,}$ the set of all possible
		variable names with a single character, and the set ${V_2,}$ the set of
		all possible variable names with two characters. The problem
		essentially asks us to determine ${n(V),}$ which is ${n(V_1) +
		n(V_2).}$
	</p>
	<p>
		We first determine ${n(V_1).}$ Our immediate constraint is that the
		variable name must begin with a letter. Thus, for the first character,
		there are ${26}$ choices (uppercase and lowercase letters are not
		distinguished). This takes care of the first character and determines
		the number of possible variable names of a single character: ${26.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, we determine ${n(V_2).}$ The second character can be either one
		of the 26 English letters or one of the 10 digits. Applying the sum
		rule, there are 36 possible choices for each of the 26 choices for the
		first character. But, five of these choices will result in a reserved
		string, so we must subtract ${5}$ from ${36:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${26 \times (36 - 5) = 931}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, because the variable name can be either one or two characters, the
		number of variable names is given by the sum rule:
	</p>
	<figure>$$ n(V) = n(V_1) + n(V_2) = 26 + 931 = 957 $$</figure>
	<p>
		Hence, there are ${957}$ possible variable names in ${X.}$ Not a
		particularly expressive language.
	</p>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			A website requires its users to choose a password that is six to
			eight characters long. Each character in the password must be either
			an uppercase letter or a digit. Each password must contain at least
			one digit. How many possible passwords are there?
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		First, we denote the set of all passwords as ${P.}$ The set ${P}$
		consists of three subsets: ${P_6,}$ the set of all passwords ${6}$
		characters long, ${P_7,}$ the set of all passwords ${7}$ characters
		long, and ${P_8,}$ the set of all passwords ${8}$ characters long. The
		number of possible passwords then is:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(P) = n(P_6) + n(P_7) + n(P_8)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We first consider ${n(P_6).}$ This is where we run into difficulty. The
		constraint that each password must contain at least one digit doesn't
		help as much, at least directly. The password could be all digits, some
		letters and one digit, some letters and two digits, and so on.
		Accordingly, we must find ${n(P_6)}$ indirectly. To do so, we first
		determine the number of 6-character strings consisting of letters and
		digits, and then we determine the number of 6-character strings with no
		digits. If we subtract these two numbers, we have a set of 6-character
		character strings where no string is consists entirely of letters.
		Fortunately, these are a straightforward applications of the product
		rule:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} n(P_6) &= 36^6 - 26^6 \\ &= 2~176~782~336 -
		308~915~776 \\ &= 1~867~866~560 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>Applying the same analysis to ${P_7:}$</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} n(P_7) &= 36^7 - 26^7 \\ &= 78~364~164~096 -
		8~031~810~176 \\ &= 70~332~353~920 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>And to ${P_8:}$</p>

	$$ \begin{aligned} n(P_8) &= 36^8 - 26^8 \\ &= 2~821~109~907~456 -
	208~827~064~576 \\ &= 2~612~282~842~880 \end{aligned} $$

	<p>Hence, there are:</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} n(P) &= n(P_6) + n(P_7) + n(P_8) \\ &= 1~867~866~560
		+ 70~332~353~920 + 2~612~282~842~880 \\ &= 2~684~483~063~360
		\end{aligned} $$

	<h2>The Subtraction Rule</h2>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			How many bit strings 8 bits long begin with a ${1}$ or end with the
			two bits ${00?}$
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		We cannot directly solve this problem with the sum and product rules
		alone. But, we can try and reason our way through it. First, from the
		facts, we have two possible choices: (1) The bit string starts with a
		${1,}$ or (2) the bit string ends with ${00.}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>Choice (1): <span class="monoText">1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _</span></p>
			<p>Choice (2): <span class="monoText">_ _ _ _ _ _ 0 0</span></p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For choice (1), there are 7 slots available, so we have ${2^7 = 128}$
		possible strings. For choice (2), there are 6 slots available, so we
		have ${2^6 = 64}$ possible strings. Both of these conclusions follow
		from the product rule.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rub, however, is that some of the possibilities for (1) and (2) are
		the same. Namely, these are the strings that begin with ${1}$ and end
		with ${00:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				In both (1) and (2): <span class="monoText">1 _ _ _ _ _ 0 0</span>
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we simply added the possibilities of choices (1) and (2), we would
		be counting these possibilities twice. Accordingly, we must subtract
		the possibilities where the string begins with ${1}$ and ends with
		${00.}$ There are five slots empty, so there are ${2^5 = 32}$ of such
		possibilities. Hence, there are:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${128 + 64 - 32 = 160}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		possible big strings. The analysis above demonstrates the subtraction
		rule:
	</p>

	<dfn>
		<small>Subtraction Rule</small>
		<p>
			If a decision can be made in either ${n_1}$ ways or ${n_2}$ ways,

<section id="the_division_rule">
	<h2>The Division Rule</h2>
	<p>
		So far, we've seen the product rule, the sum rule, and the subtraction
		rule. There's one more fundamental rule to explore. The motivating
		problem:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			A bricklayer has 6 colored bricks. 4 of the bricks are red, 2 are
			white. How many possible ways can the bricklayer arrange these
			bricks?
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		From the facts, we know that with each brick laid, there are less
		bricks to lay. Thus, if all the bricks were of the same color, we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${6 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6! = 720}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		possible arrangements. However, the bricks do not all have the same
		color. 4 are red and 2 are white. But, we know that for each of these
		${720}$ possibilities, the arrangement consists of red and white
		bricks. Accordingly, to find the number of possibilities, we simply
		divide the total number of possibilities by the number of possibilities
		for red bricks times the number of possibilities for the white bricks:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>$$ \dfrac{6!}{2! 4!} = 15 $$</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, there are ${15}$ possibilities. This problem demonstrates the
		division rule:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Division Rule.</small>
		<p>
			If a decision can be made in ${n}$ ways, and for every way ${w,}$

			How many different ordered arrangements of the letters ${a,}$ ${b,}$
			and ${c}$ are possible?
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>Directly enumerating the possiblities:</p>

		\end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		we see that there are ${6}$ possibilities. Each of these possibilities
		is called a <b>permutation</b>.
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Definition: Permutation</small>
		<p>
			A <i>permutation</i> of the set ${\{ 1,2,3,\ldots,n \}}$ is a list of
			its ${n}$ elements where each element appears eactly once in the
			list. In general, there are:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ n(n-1)(n-1) \ldots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n! $$</figure>
		<p>permutations of a set of size ${n.}$</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		Permutations are essentially tuples. They are arrangements of the
		elements of a set where <i>order</i> distinguishes one tuple from
		another. For example, in the previous problem, the tuple ${(a, b, c)}$
		is different from the tuple ${(a, c, b).}$
	</p>
	<p>Now consider the following problem:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Problem</small>
		<p>
			How many ways are there to order ${2}$ letters out of the ${\{ a, b,
			c, d\}?}$
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		In this counting problem, we're just looking at arranging two letters:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{array}{c:c:c} & 1 & 2 \\ \hline & a & b \\ & a & c \\ & a & d
		\\ & b & a \\ & b & c \\ & b & d \\ & c & a \\ & c & b \\ & c & d
		\end{array} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice that there are ${9}$ possible arrangements. If the problem
		instead asked for all four letters, we would have ${4! = 24}$ possible
		arrangements.
	</p>
	<p>This illustrates the formula:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Permutation: Number of Tuples</small>
		<p>
			Given a set of size ${n,}$ choosing ${r}$ elements, the number of

			Suppose we have a six-sided die. How many ways can we roll an even

		<section id="complimentary_counting">

			<dfn>
				<small>problem</small>
				<p>
					How many three-digit numbers are <em>not</em> multiples of ${7?}$
				</p>
			</dfn>
			<p>
				This problem is best solved through
				<b>complementary counting</b> &mdash; counting what we
				<i>do not</i> want to count. Often, it's much easier to count
				whatever it is we don't want, as opposed to what we actually want.
				In this case, the largest three digit number is ${999.}$ The
				smallest three digit number is ${100.}$ With a little trial and
				error, we find that: (1) the smallest multiple of ${7}$ which is a
				three digit number is ${105 / 7 = 15.}$ The largest multiple of
				${7}$ which is a three digit number is ${994 / 7 = 142.}$
			</p>
			<p>
				These two numbers, ${105}$ and ${994,}$ form the endpoints for our
				count. Since we're counting multiples of ${7,}$ the number of
				multiples of ${7}$ from ${105}$ through ${994}$ is:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ 142 - 15 + 1 = 128 $$</figure>

			<h4>Factorials</h4>
			<p>The <b>factorial</b> is defined as follows:</p>
			<dfn>
				<dt>Definition: Factorial</dt>
				<p>If ${n \in \Z^{+},}$ then <i>${n}$ factorial</i> is denoted:</p>
				<dd>${n! = (n)(n-1)(n-1) \ldots (3)(2)(1)}$</dd>
			</dfn>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<figure>$$ 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 $$</figure>
			<p>Note that there is a special case with factorials:</p>
			<dfn>
				<dt>Special Case: Zero Factorial</dt>
				<p>Zero factorial is equal to ${1.}$</p>
				<dd>${0! = 1}$</dd>
			</dfn>
			<p>
				Why is zero factorial ${1?}$ Because factorials, at their core, are
				a way to express arrangement. And there is only one way to arrange
				nothing. What do we mean by <q>express arrangment?</q> The answer
				is best illustrated via example. Consider the following question:
			</p>
			<dfn>
				<p>
					<small>problem</small>
					How many ways can we write a list of ${4}$ letters &mdash; ${\{
					a, b, c, d \}}$ &mdash; without repeating any?
				</p>
			</dfn>
			<p>
				The key constraint to this problem is the fact that we cannot
				repeat. This means that whatever we pick for the first letter in
				the list cannot then be picked for the second, third, or fourth.
				And whatever we pick for the second cannot then be picked for the
				third, or fourth, and so on. This means that, by the multiplication
				rule, we have:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 4! = 24 $$</figure>
			<p>possible lists.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="permutations">
			<h4>Permutations</h4>
			<p>
				The factorial, which stems directly from the product rule, provides
				a way of counting <b>permutations</b> &mdash; arrangements of
				objects where <i>order matters</i>. And where order matters, there
				is an additional question we want to ask: Can we replace? For
				example:
			</p>
			<div class="bipart">
				<div>
					<p>
						<small>problem</small> How many permutations of ${\{ a,b,c \}}$
						are there, replacement not allowed?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>There are ${3! = 6}$ permutations:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>${(a, b, c)}$</li>
						<li>${(a, c, b)}$</li>
						<li>${(b, a, c)}$</li>
						<li>${(b, c, a)}$</li>
						<li>${(c, a, b)}$</li>
						<li>${(c, b, a)}$</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="bipart">
				<div>
					<p>
						<small>problem</small> How many permutations of ${\{ 0, 1 \}}$
						are there, replacement allowed?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>There are ${2 \times 2 = 4}$ permutations:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>${(0,0)}$</li>
						<li>${(0,1)}$</li>
						<li>${(1,0)}$</li>
						<li>${(1,1)}$</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The illustration above yields an important point: Whenever we're
				dealing with permutations, we must always consider whether we're
				allowed to replace (i.e., <q>reuse</q> a particular object in the
				arrangement). With this in mind, we consider the following problem:
			</p>
			<div class="bipart">
				<div>
					<p>
						<small>problem</small> How many ways can write a list of four
						numbers from the set ${\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \},}$ with no numbers
						repeating?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						The list consists of four spaces, and we aren't allowed to
						replace. Thus, we have:
					</p>
					<figure>$$ 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 840 $$</figure>
					<p>possible lists.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The problem above is an application of a more general formula for
				the number of permutations:
			</p>
			<dfn>
				<small>formula</small>
				<p>
					The number of permutations of length ${k}$ from a list of ${n}$
					elements <i>without repetition</i> is given by:
				</p>
				<figure>$$ \dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!} $$</figure>
			</dfn>
			<p>With this rule in mind, consider the following problem:</p>
			<dfn>
				<p>
					<small>problem</small> How many ways can we order the letters in
					the word ${err?}$
				</p>
			</dfn>
			<p>
				This problem is a bit more peculiar, since we have two letters that
				are the same: ${r}$ and ${r.}$ A helpful starting point is to
				denote the word's letters as a set, differentiating the two ${r}$s:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \{ e, r_1, r_2 \} $$</figure>
			<p>If we listed all the possiblities:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>${(e, r_1, r_2)}$</li>
				<li>${(e, r_2, r_1)}$</li>
				<li>${(r_1, e, r_2)}$</li>
				<li>${(r_1, r_2, e)}$</li>
				<li>${(r_2, e, r_1)}$</li>
				<li>${(r_2, r_1, e)}$</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				It looks as if we have ${6}$ possible arrangements. In reality,
				however, an ${r}$ is an ${r.}$ This means that possibilities with
				sequential ${r}$s are <em>not</em> unique:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>${(e, r_1, r_2)}$</li>
				<li>${\cancel{(e, r_2, r_1)}}$</li>
				<li>${(r_1, e, r_2)}$</li>
				<li>${(r_1, r_2, e)}$</li>
				<li>${\cancel{(r_2, e, r_1)}}$</li>
				<li>${\cancel{(r_2, r_1, e)}}$</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Looking at it this way, we just have three possible ways to order
				the letters in the word ${err.}$ Is there a formula we can use for
				computing the possibilities in this situation? Sure. Ordinarily,
				given ${n}$ objects, to count the number of permutations without
				replacement, we would just compute ${n!}$ (in this case, ${3! =
				6}$). However, when we have duplicates, as we saw with our problem,
				we must divide by the number of times each object occurs. In this
				case, ${e}$ occurs exactly once, so we divide by ${1!}$:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \dfrac{3!}{1!} $$</figure>
			<p>Then we see that ${r}$ occurs twice, so we get:</p>
			<figure>$$ \dfrac{3!}{(1!)(2!)} = 3 $$</figure>
			<p>To see that this formula works, here's another problem:</p>
			<dfn>
				<p>
					<small>problem</small> How many ways can we order the letters in
					the word ${Mississippi?}$
				</p>
			</dfn>
			<p>Here, we see that there ${11}$ letters, so we have:</p>
			<figure>$$ 11! $$</figure>
			<p>
				The letter ${M}$ occurs exactly once, the letter ${i}$ occurs ${4}$
				times, the letter ${s}$ occurs ${4}$ times, and the letter ${p}$
				occurs twice. Thus, we have:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \dfrac{11!}{(1!)(4!)(4!)(2!)} = 34~650 $$</figure>
			<p>
				possible ways to order the letters in the word ${Mississippi.}$
				Note that this formula is just an expanded form of the factorial as
				applied to counting. For example: How many different ways can we
				order the letters in the word ${mad?}$ According to our formula,
				it's just:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \dfrac{3!}{(1!)(1!)(1!)} = 6 $$</figure>
			<p>
				The permutation formula can be extended to problems that do not
				appear, at first, to be counting problems. Consider the following
				problem:
			</p>
			<div class="split">
				<div>
					<p>
						<small>problem</small> How many paths are there from ${(1,1)}$
						to ${(4,3)}$ if the only legal moves are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>${(x,y) \to (x+1, y)}$</li>
						<li>${(x,y) \to (x, y+1)}$</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<img
					src="{% static 'images/permutation_graphing.svg' %}"
					alt="permutation graphing"
					loading="lazy"
					height="150px"
				/>
			</div>
			<p>
				To solve this problem, let's give some names to the moves. The
				legal moves are ${(x+1,y)}$ or ${(x, y+1).}$ In the first move, we
				stay on the same ${\text{$y$-coordinate},}$ and move right by
				${1.}$ We'll denote this move ${E}$ for <i>east</i>. In the second
				move, we stay on the same ${\text{$x$-coordinate},}$ and move up by
				${1.}$ We'll denote this move ${N}$ for <i>north</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since we're starting at the point ${(1,1),}$ we must perform ${3}$
				east movements:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \{ E, E, E \} $$</figure>
			<p>We also need to perform ${2}$ north movements:</p>
			<figure>$$ \{ E, E, E, N, N \} $$</figure>
			<p>
				This constitutes the entire set of possible moves we can make. The
				question then is: How many possible ways can we order these
				movements? Easy &mdash; we just apply our formula. There are ${5}$
				moves. ${E}$ occurs three times, and ${N}$ occurs two times:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{5!}{(3!)(2!)} &=
				\dfrac{(5)(4)\cancel{(3!)}}{\cancel{(3!)}(2!)} \\[1em] &=
				\dfrac{20}{2} \\[1em] &= 10 \end{aligned} $$
			</figure>
			<p>
				There are ${10}$ possible ways to move from ${(1,1)}$ to ${(4,3)}$
				given the two legal moves of moving only east by ${1}$ or north by
				${1.}$

				<h4>Rotational Duplicates</h4>

				<p>Let's consider another problem:</p>
				<dfn>
					<small>Problem</small>
					<p>
						How many ways are there to arrange six people at circular
						table?
					</p>
				</dfn>
				<p>
					To tackle this problem, it's helpful to begin with a diagram:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img
						src="{% static 'images/circular_table.svg' %}"
						alt=""
						loading="lazy"
						height="100px"
					/>
				</figure>
				<p>
					There are, in fact, ${6!}$ ways of arranging people on this
					table. The problem, however, is that some of those positions may
					be duplicated. For example, suppose we started with the
					arrangement as shown in the diagram above. If we shifted everyone
					to the right, we would get:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img
						src="{% static 'images/circular_table1.svg' %}"
						alt=""
						loading="lazy"
						height="100px"
					/>
				</figure>
				<p>
					This would be counted among the ${6!}$ calculation, but it isn't
					a different seating arrangement. The people are still in the same
					arrangement relative to one another; they're just in different
					seats. Accordingly, the actual number of ways is:
				</p>
				<figure>$$ \dfrac{6!}{6} = 5! $$</figure>
				<p>
					We have to divide by ${6}$ to get rid of the count for a mere
					shift. Let's add another wrinkle to the problem:
				</p>
				<dfn>
					<small>Problem</small>
					<p>
						Suppose six people must be seated at circular table. Three are
						men, three are women. How many different ways can we arrange
						the men and women such that the genders alternate?
					</p>
				</dfn>
				<p>Again, it's helpful to diagram:</p>
				<figure>
					<img
						src="{% static 'images/men_women_alternate.svg' %}"
						alt=""
						loading="lazy"
						height="130px"
					/>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Because the constraint is to alternate, our initial thought might
					be to map out the different ways to arrange each person:
				</p>
				<table class="alg">
					<thead>
						<th>Person</th>
						<th>Possible Ways</th>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>${m_1}$</td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${w_1}$</td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${m_2}$</td>
							<td>2</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${w_2}$</td>
							<td>2</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${m_3}$</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${w_3}$</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p>This yields:</p>
				<figure>
					$$ 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 36 $$
				</figure>
				<p>
					possible seating arrangements. But, like we saw with the previous
					problem, this computation also counts the arrangement where each
					person simply shifts over by ${1}$ seat. The question then is,
					should we divide by ${6?}$
				</p>
				<p>
					Not exactly. In this problem, the key constraint is that the
					genders must alternate. Accordingly, a better way to think about
					this problem is to place an <b>anchor position</b>, and then
					denote the remaining positions in terms of ${O}$ (opposite
					gender), and ${S}$ (same gender). The anchor position ${A}$
					essentially starts the list, which ends at ${O_3,}$ and we then
					move ${A}$ around. Thinking of it this way, our diagram becomes:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img
						src="{% static 'images/men_women_alternate1.svg' %}"
						alt=""
						loading="lazy"
						height="130px"
					/>
				</figure>
				<p>which in turn shows that the number of possible ways are:</p>
				<table class="alg">
					<thead>
						<th>Person</th>
						<th>Possible Ways</th>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>${A}$</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${O_1}$</td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${S_1}$</td>
							<td>2</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${O_2}$</td>
							<td>2</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${S_2}$</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>${O_3}$</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p>Hence, there are:</p>
				<figure>
					$$ 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 12 $$
				</figure>
				<p>ways to seat the men and women.</p>
				<p>
					If the examples aren't entirely clear, a helpful way to think
					about this intuitively is to just consider a simpler example.
					Let's say ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ are seated on a circular table.
					How many ways are there to arrange ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c?}$ Well,
					let's list them out. First, keep ${a}$ anchored, then move ${b}$
					and ${c.}$ Next keep ${b}$ anchored, and move ${a}$ and ${c.}$
					Finally, keep ${c}$ anchored and move ${a}$ and ${b.}$ That will
					yield all the possible arrangements:
				</p>
				<table class="alg">
					<thead>
						<th>Anchored</th>
						<th>Permutations</th>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<td>${a}$</td>
						<td>$$ (a, b, c) \\ (a, c, b) $$</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>${b}$</td>
						<td>$$ (a, b, c) \\ (c, b, a) $$</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>${c}$</td>
						<td>$$ (a, b, c) \\ (b, a, c) $$</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					Because the table is circular, there are duplicates in the count.
					Let's color all of the duplicates:
				</p>
				<table class="alg">
					<thead>
						<th>Anchored</th>
						<th>Permutations</th>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<td>${a}$</td>
						<td>
							$$ \textcolor{red}{(a, b, c)} \\ \textcolor{teal}{(a, c, b)}
							$$
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>${b}$</td>
						<td>
							$$ \textcolor{red}{(a, b, c)} \\ \textcolor{teal}{(c, b, a)}
							$$
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>${c}$</td>
						<td>
							$$ \textcolor{red}{(a, b, c)} \\ \textcolor{teal}{(b, a, c)}
							$$
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					Examining the duplicates, we see that there really just two ways
					to seat three people on a circular table:
				</p>

					<img
						src="{% static 'images/rotational_duplicates.svg' %}"

		<section id="combinations">
			<h4>Combinations</h4>
			<p>
				With permutations, order matters. With combinations, however,
				<i>order does not matter</i>. One way to think about this
				distinction is that with permutations, we're looking for the number
				of possible <i>sequences</i> under the given constraints. But with
				combinations, we're looking for <i>subsets</i> under the given
				constraints. For example, consider the following problem:
			</p>
			<dfn>
				<small>Problem</small>
				<p>
					Let ${A}$ be the set ${\{ a, b, c \}.}$ How many different
					subsets can be mad with ${2}$ elements?
				</p>
			</dfn>
			<p>If we listed all the different permutations, we would have:</p>
			<div class="tripart">
				$$ \{a, b\} \\ \{a, c\} $$ $$ \{b, a\} \\ \{b, c\} $$ $$ \{c, a\}
				\\ \{c, b\} $$
			</div>
			<p>
				However, because sets do not inherently have order &mdash; i.e.,
				order does not matter &mdash; several of the sets above are
				identical. Thus, if we counted all of the sets above separately,
				we'd have duplicates. Let's color match the identical sets:
			</p>
			<div class="tripart">
				$$ \textcolor{red}{\{a, b\}} \\ \textcolor{purple}{\{a, c\}} $$ $$
				\textcolor{red}{\{b, a\}} \\ \textcolor{teal}{\{b, c\}} $$ $$
				\textcolor{purple}{\{c, a\}} \\ \textcolor{teal}{\{c, b\}} $$
			</div>
			<p>
				Looking at this way, we see that there are only three different
				subsets that can be made:
			</p>
			<figure>$$ \{ a, b \},~~\{ b, c \},~~\{ a, c \} $$</figure>

		<section id="multiplcation_rule_probability">
			<h3>The Multiplication Rule & Probability</h3>
			<p>
				Suppose we perform an experiment ${E_1}$ with ${n_1}$ outcomes.
				After performing ${E_1,}$ we perform a second experiment ${E_2,}$
				with ${n_2}$ outcomes. Suppose we continue performing ${r}$
				experiments, such that for each experiment ${E_r,}$ there are
				${n_r}$ outcomes. Then overall, there are:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>${n_1 \times n_2 \times \ldots \times n_r}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				possible outcomes. We can visualize the multiplication rule with a
				dendogram (i.e., a tree diagram). Suppose we had three ice cream
				flavors: strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate. Suppose further that
				we had two types of cones: waffle and pretzel. What are the
				possible ice cream cones we can get? We can suppose the first
				experiment is selecting a cone, and the second experiment is
				selecting a flavor. In which case we have:
			</p>
			<div id="iceCreamTree"></div>
			<p>
				Counting the tree's <i>leaves</i> (nodes without children), we see
				that there are ${6}$ total possibilities, or ${6}$ total possible
				ice cream cones. This corresponds to the multiplication rule:
			</p>
			<figure>$$2 \times 3 = 6$$</figure>
			<p>
				Note that we could've also picked a flavor first, followed by a
				cone:
			</p>
			<div id="iceCreamTree1"></div>
			<p>
				Doing so does not change the result &mdash; we still have six
				possibilities. Examining the multiplication rule from the
				perspective of a tree diagram, we can see that the number of
				possibilities grows exponentially. If we had ${10}$ ice cream
				flavors, we would have ${2^{10} = 1024}$ possible ice cream cones.
				This tells us that experiments following the multiplication rule
				grow very, very quickly.

		<h3>The Binomial Coefficient</h3>
		<p>
			Here's another example. Using the naive definition, what is the
			probability of a full house in a game of poker? First, we make the
			following assumptions: (1) The deck consists of 52 unique cards; (2)
			a poker hand consists of five cards; and (3) the deck is shuffled
			such that the five cards comprising a hand are all equally likely.
			With these assumptions, we can begin analyzing.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, we denote the ${5}$ cards chosen as a
			<b>binomial coefficient</b>:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\dbinom{52}{5}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We read the notation above as <q>Fifty-two choose five.</q
			><sup></sup> In other words, given ${52}$ cards, take ${5}$ cards.
			Recall that the binomial coefficient is defined as follows:
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				These materials assume familiarity with the binomial theorem and
				binomial coefficients, so we won't delve into them deeply. For a
				review, see
				<a href="{% url 'numerm:balg_equations' %}#binomial_coefficients"
					><strong>Classical Algebra: Binomial Coefficients</strong>.</a
				>
			</p>
		</div>
		<dfn>
			<small>Definition: Binomial Coefficient</small>
			<p>
				Where ${n}$ and ${k}$ are nonnegative integers, the
				<i>binomial coefficient</i> is defined as follows:
			</p>
			$$ \dbinom{n}{k} = \begin{cases} \dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} &\text{ if }
			~~k \leq n \\[2em] 0 &\text{ else } \end{cases} $$
		</dfn>
		<p>
			The binomial coefficient represents the following proposition:
			<q
				>Given ${n}$ choices, how many ways can we choose ${k}$ out of
				${n.}$</q
			>
			In other words, choose a subset of ${n}$ of size ${k,}$ where order
			does not matter. Accordingly, when we write ${\dbinom{n}{k},}$ we are
			denoting the size of a particular set. In this case, the subset of
			${n}$ of size ${k,}$ with the condition that order is irrelevant.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the definition above, it follows that if ${k > n}$ (the
			else-condition in the definition above) then the set
			${\dbinom{n}{k}}$ must be zero, because if we have ${k}$ choices, we
			can't choose more than ${k.}$ I.e., if we have ${10}$ applicants for
			a job position, we can't choose ${11}$ applicants. We make this
			proposition explicit:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> Given two nonnegative integers
					${n}$ and ${k,}$ the following proposition is true:

					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			That said, let's return to our full house problem. In poker, a full
			house is defined as three cards of one rank and two of another. For
			example, three ${7}$s and two Jacks, or three Kings and two ${4}$s.
		</p>
		<p>Generalizing the hand, we have:</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${((3,r_1),~(2,r_2))}$<sup></sup></p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				As an aside, in probability &mdash; and mathematics more generally
				&mdash; it's always helpful to descriptively, and concisely, label
				objects. For example, if we have a problem concerning a jar of red
				and green candy, we want to break the problem down into descriptive
				symbols, stating them as assumptions: Let the total number of
				candies be ${n.}$ Suppose the jar of red candy consists of ${R}$
				candies, each candy ${1, 2, \ldots, R.}$ Further suppose the jar of
				green candy consits of ${G}$ candies, each candy ${R+1, R+2, R+3,
				\ldots, R+G.}$
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Let's consider the first part of the hand, the three cards. What can
			we have three of? Well, there are ${13}$ ranks, so there are ${13}$
			possibilities. In other words, <q>${13}$ choose ${1.}$</q> Applying
			the binomial coefficient, our formula looks thus far as:
		</p>
		<figure>$$ \dfrac{\dbinom{13}{1}}{\dbinom{52}{5}} $$</figure>
		<p>
			This takes care of choosing the rank for the first part of the hand.
			Now we apply the multiplication rule. Suppose we chose as a rank
			King. There are four Kings in a deck of cards, and we must choose
			three out of the four. Accordingly, we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \dfrac{\dbinom{13}{1} \cdot \dbinom{4}{3} }{\dbinom{52}{5}} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Now we must handle the second part of the hand, the two cards. Both
			of these cards must be the same rank, and that rank must be different
			from the rank we just chose. Because we just chose a rank, there are
			twelve ranks remaining &mdash; ${12}$ choose ${1.}$ Accordingly, we
			have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \dfrac{\dbinom{13}{1} \cdot \dbinom{4}{3} \cdot \dbinom{12}{1}
			}{\dbinom{52}{5}} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Then, we need two of this chosen rank:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \dfrac{\dbinom{13}{1} \cdot \dbinom{4}{3} \cdot \dbinom{12}{1}
			\cdot \dbinom{4}{2} }{\dbinom{52}{5}} $$
		</figure>
		<p>Simplifying this, we have:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{\dbinom{13}{1} \cdot \dbinom{4}{3} \cdot
			\dbinom{12}{1} \cdot \dbinom{4}{2} }{\dbinom{52}{5}} &= \dfrac{13
			\cdot \dbinom{4}{3} \cdot 12 \cdot \dbinom{4}{2} }{\dbinom{52}{5}}
			\\[3em] &= \dfrac{13 \cdot 4 \cdot 12 \cdot 6}{2~598~960} \\[2em] &=
			\dfrac{3744}{2~598~960} \\[2em] &= \dfrac{3744}{2~598~960} \\[2em] &=

	<section id="sampling_table">
		<h3>Sampling Tables</h3>
		<p>
			Having examined the rule's above, we can summarize outcome counting
			as follows. When we are told to choose ${k}$ objects out of ${n,}$
			there are two questions we should always ask:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Does order matter?</li>
			<li>Are we replacing?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			When we say that order matters, we mean that choices are unique in
			terms of the order they're made in. For example, choosing John then
			Alice is distinct from choosing Alice then John. If order does not
			matter, then choosing John then Alice is the same as choosing Alice
			then John.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, whether we're allowed to replace impacts how much we can count.
			By replacement, we mean that, if we choose between ${Mango}$ and
			${Kiwi,}$ we can choose: ${(Mango, Mango)}$, ${(Mango, Kiwi)}$,
			${(Kiwi, Kiwi)}$, ${(Kiwi, Mango).}$
		</p>
		<p>We can summarize these findings in a <b>sample table</b>:</p>
		<figure style="margin: 0">
			<table class="punnett">
				<thead>
					<th></th>
					<th>order matters</th>
					<th>order does not matter</th>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>can replace</td>
						<td>${\Large n^k}$</td>
						<td>
							${\left( \dbinom{n}{k} \right) = \dbinom{n + k - 1}{k} =
							\dfrac{(n + k - 1)!}{k!(n-1)!}}$
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>cannot replace</td>
						<td>${n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots(n-(k-1)) = n!}$</td>
						<td>${\dbinom{n}{k} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}$</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</figure>
		<p>
			For the sake of conciseness, we use the following terms to denote
			each of the sampling conditions above.
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose ${n}$ things are
					taken ${k}$ at a time, then:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>

						<b>multicombination</b>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The table's entries are consistent with what we've seen so far. The
			one exception is the scenario where order is irrelevant, and
			replacement is permissible. In this case, we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${\dbinom{n + k - 1}{k}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			This is peculiar result, and it's not immediately clear why this is
			the case. Let's clarify this result.
		</p>
		<p>
			To begin, we should be clear about what it is we're doing. We want to
			pick something ${k}$ times from a set of ${n}$ objects, with the
			conditions that: (1) order does not matter, and (2) we can replace.
			In other words, we pick some object, put it back, pick another, put
			it back, pick another, put it back, &hellip;, ${k}$ times. But in
			doing so, our selections aren't unique in terms of order. Thus,
			picking ${A-A-B}$ is no different from ${A-B-A}$ or ${B-A-A.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			The formula provides that the number of possible selections is given
			by ${n + k - 1}$ choose ${k.}$ Let's consider the edge cases. The
			simplest edge case is ${k = 0.}$
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dbinom{n + k - 1}{k} &= \dbinom{n + (0) - 1}{0}
			\\[1em] &= \dbinom{n - 1}{0} \\[1em] &= 1 \\[1em] \end{aligned} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Indeed, there is only one way to chose ${0}$ objects from ${n}$
			objects with replacement and disregarding order &mdash; do nothing.
			If there are ${n}$ toppings for a hotdog and and no one is there to
			order the toppings, there is only one way to order toppings &mdash;
			do not order toppings. There is exactly one way to do nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
			What if ${k = 1?}$ In this case (using our same spices), we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \dbinom{n + k - 1}{k} &= \dbinom{n + 1 - 1}{1}
				\\[1em] &= \dbinom{n}{1} \\[1em] &= n \end{aligned} $$
			</div>
			<p>
				This makes sense. If we're only picking once, it's irrelevant
				whether we're replacing or taking things in order.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's consider the <i>simplest non-trivial case</i>. Here, it's
				${n = 2.}$ If ${n = 2,}$ then we have:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \begin{aligned} \dbinom{n + k - 1}{k} &= \dbinom{2 + k - 1}{k}
				\\[1em] &= \dbinom{k + 1}{k} \end{aligned} $$

			Given ${5}$ items ${\{ a, b, c, d, e \},}$ how many different groups

		In this question, we see that there are ${5}$ ways to select the
		initial item, ${4}$ ways to select the next, and ${3}$ ways to select
		the last. The problem, however, is that we've double counted.
	</p>
	<p>
		With permutations, we were counting either (1) the number of possible
		<i>tuples</i>, or (2) the number of possible <i>sequences</i>, given
		set of ${n}$ unique elements. Many problems, however, ask us to
		determine the number of <i>subsets</i> given a set of ${n}$ unique
		elements. Recognizing this difference is helpful for distinguishing
		between permutations and combinations. Tuples and sequences are
		inherently <i>ordered</i>, but <i>subsets</i> are mere collections
		&mdash; there is no notion of order.

<section id="the_pigeonhole_principle">
	<h2>The Pigeonhole Principle</h2>
	<p>
		Say we had ${3}$ pigeons, and ${2}$ holes. Every pigeon must go into
		one, and only one, hole. The piegeonhole principle states that under
		these constraints, one hole must house at least two pigeons. This makes
		sense &mdash; there are more pigeons than holes, so one of the holes
		must be shared.
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Pigeonhole Principle</small>
		<p>
			Let ${n}$ and ${k}$ be positive integers, where ${k &lt; n}$ Suppose
			${n}$ identical objects must be placed into ${k}$ identical boxes.
			Then there will be at least one box in which we place at least two
			objects.
		</p>
	</dfn>
	<p>
		In pigeon-speak, given ${n}$ pigeons, each assigned to one of ${m}$
		holes, if ${m &lt; n,}$ then there must be some hole with at least
		${2}$ pigeons.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note what this theorem implies. If we had ${1000}$ pigeons and ${100}$
		holes, at least one of those ${100}$ holes will hold
		<i>at least</i> ${2}$ pigeons. It doesn't state that some hole will
		house exactly ${2}$ pigeons, it merely states that some hole will house
		<i>at least</i> ${2}$ pigeons.
	</p>
	<p>The theorem's proof is straightforward:</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Proof: Pigeonhole Principle</small>
		<p>
			Let ${n}$ and ${k}$ be positive integers, where ${k &lt; n}$ Suppose
			${n}$ objects must be placed into ${k}$ identical boxes. Now assume
			that no box contains at least two objects. It follows that each of
			the ${k}$ boxes contains either ${0}$ or ${1}$ object.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let ${m}$ be the number of boxes with ${0}$ objects. It follows that
			${m \geq 0.}$ Given that ${m}$ is the number of boxes with ${0}$
			objects, there are ${k - m}$ boxes with ${1}$ object. This implies
			that ${k - m \leq k.}$ Given that ${k &lt; n,}$
		</p>
		<figure>$$ k - m \leq k &lt; n $$</figure>
		<p>
			This contradicts the fact that ${n}$ objects must be placed into
			${k}$ boxes. Thus, it cannot be true that there is no box with at
			least two objects. Therefore, it must be true that there is at least
			one box with at least two objects. ${\blacksquare}$

		The pigeonhole principle seems simple, but it can lead to some
		surprising results. For example, from the pigeonhole principle, it
		follows that there is some pair of non-bald people in Chicago with
		exactly the same number of hairs on their head. How is this true? Well,
		there are about ${2.7 \times 10^6}$ people (pigeons) in Chicago. Each
		person has about ${10^5}$ hairs. Some people have only ${1}$ hair (a
		particular hole), others have ${2}$ hairs (another hole), and others
		have ${10^3}$ hairs (yet another hole). Thus, there are roughly
		${10^5}$ possible holes. Because there are more people (pigeons) than
		holes (number of hairs), it follows that at least one pair of people
		have the exact same number of hairs on their head (share a hole).
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's another example. A <i>blue moon</i> is a month where we have two
		full moons in the same month. This a fairly uncommon occurrence. The
		lunar cycle usually lasts a month, so most months have exactly one full
		moon. More specifically, a lunar cycle lasts roughly ${29.53}$ days,
		and every ${3}$ years, there are just a little over ${37}$ full lunar
		cycles. Thus, there are at least ${37}$ full moons in ${3}$ years. Now,
		in ${3}$ years, there are ${36}$ months. This means that by the
		pigeonhole principle, there is at least one blue moon in every ${3}$
		year period. What this tells us is that, the saying
		<q>Once in a blue moon</q> does not denote something that occurs very
		rarely. Something occuring at least once every three years really isn't
		all that rare.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, to use the pigeonhole principle, we want to always answer
		the following questions before proceeding:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>What are the pigeons?</i> In other words, what are the objects
			we're working with?
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>What are the holes?</i> By <q>hole</q> we mean some set.
			Importantly, we want to ensure that the holes are all distinct. The
			set must also be well-defined, in the sense that we can assign
			objects to it.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>How are the pigeons assigned to the holes?</i> We want to have
			some mechanism that can assign at least one object to one hole.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>How do we know that there are more pigeons than holes?</i> We must
			prove that there are more objects than there are sets.

		<h3>Dirichlet's Theorem</h3>
		<dfn>
			<small>Dirichlet's Theorem</small>
			<p>
				Let ${\alpha}$ be any real number and ${q}$ a positive integer.
				There exists integers ${n}$ and ${m}$ where ${0 &lt; m \leq q,}$
				such that:
			</p>
			<figure>
				$$ \left\lvert \alpha - \dfrac{n}{m} \right\rvert \leq
				\dfrac{1}{mq} $$
			</figure>
		</dfn>
		<p>
			Dirichlet's theorem is what underlies Diophantine approximation, a
			technique for approximating real numbers (particularly irrational
			numbers) with rational numbers. Dirichlet's theorem provides that we
			can approximate some real number ${\alpha}$ as the number
			${\dfrac{n}{m}.}$ Provided that the approximation ${\dfrac{n}{m}}$
			has a denominator that isn't too big, the error, ${\dfrac{1}{mq},}$
			is quite small.
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to get to this theorem is by first fixing an ${m,}$ then find
			${n.}$ Doing so, we have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \alpha \approx \dfrac{n}{m} \equiv n \approx \alpha m $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Rewriting the theorem's equation in this form, we see that we can
			approximate ${\alpha}$ by just picking the nearest integer to
			${\alpha m}$ as ${n.}$ By picking the nearest integer, it follows
			that distance between ${n}$ and ${\alpha m}$ is at most ${1/2,}$
			since the integers are evenly spaced.
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \lvert n - am \rvert \leq \dfrac{1}{2} \equiv \left\lvert a -
			\dfrac{n}{m} \right\rvert \leq \dfrac{1}{2m} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			This, however, is not good enough. What we really wanted was
			${\dfrac{1}{mq}.}$ To fix this, we must find a a particular ${m}$
			such that ${\alpha m}$ is actually close to an integer. So, what we
			can do is consider the possibilities:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \{ \alpha \}, \{ 2\alpha \}, \{ 3\alpha \}, \ldots, \{ q\alpha \}
			$$
		</figure>
		<p>
			What we want to find is is some number that's within ${\dfrac{1}{q}}$
			of either ${0}$ or ${1.}$ This is a little too difficult, so what we
			can do is use a trick: Finding two numbers, ${s}$ and ${t,}$ that are
			close to each other, instead of ${0}$ or ${1.}$ Why can we use this
			trick? Because if ${\lvert \{ s \alpha \} - \{ t \alpha \} \rvert
			\leq \dfrac{1}{q},}$ then ${(s-t) \alpha}$ is within ${\dfrac{1}{q}}$
			of an integer.
		</p>
		<p>Let's include ${0}$ to our list of possibilities:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ 0, \{ \alpha \}, \{ 2\alpha \}, \{ 3\alpha \}, \ldots, \{ q\alpha
			\} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			This yields ${q+1}$ numbers, all between ${0}$ and ${1.}$ We want to
			show that two numbers in this list are close to each other. This is
			an example of a <b>packing problem</b> &mdash; trying to pack as many
			objects (here, numbers) within a particular bound. In this case, we
			want to distribute the possibilities into intervals:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \left[0, \dfrac{1}{q}\right], \left[\dfrac{1}{q},
			\dfrac{2}{q}\right], \ldots \left[\dfrac{q-1}{q},1\right] $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Viewed in this way, we see that there are ${q}$ intervals and ${q+1}$
			numbers. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of the numbers
			must be in the same interval. Since each of the intervals are of
			length ${\dfrac{1}{q},}$ if two numbers are in the same interval,
			then they must be within ${\dfrac{1}{q}}$ of each other.
		</p>
		<p>With this fact, we can infer that:</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \lvert \{ s\alpha \} - \{ t \alpha \} \rvert \leq \dfrac{1}{q} $$
		</figure>
		<p>
			Suppose ${m = |s - t|.}$ Then it follows that ${| m \alpha |}$ is
			within ${\dfrac{1}{q}}$ of some integer. If ${n}$ is that integer,
			then:
		</p>
		<figure>
			$$ \left\lvert \alpha - \dfrac{n}{m} \right\rvert \leq \dfrac{1}{mq}
			$$
		</figure>
