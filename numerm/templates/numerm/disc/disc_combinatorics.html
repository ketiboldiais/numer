<h1>Combinatorics</h1>
<section>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				John plays a video game where there are 50 characters to chose from.
				John must construct a team of characters. The team can only consist of 5
				unique characters, selected from the 50 characters. How many different
				teams can John construct?
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of a <span class="term">combinatorics</span> problem.
		Combinatorics is the study of <span class="italicsText">combinations</span>,
		or <span class="italicsText">arrangements</span>, of discrete objects. By
		and large, questions in combinatorics fall into a few categories:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Existence.</span> Given some things and a set of
				conditions, does a particular arrangement ${x}$ exist?
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Enumeration.</span> How many different ways are
				there to arrange these things given this set of conditions?
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Analysis.</span> What are the properties, or
				characteristics, of this particular arrangement?
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Optimization.</span> Given all these different
				arrangements, what is the most optimal?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Not every combinatorics problem falls into the categories above, and of
		those that do, they may not fit so neatly. The categorization presented is
		intended to be illustrative, rather than comprehensive. However, many of the
		most useful ideas in combinatorics stem from the aforementioned questions,
		and it is these ideas that we explore. Accordingly, for our purposes,
		combinatorics is the study of the existence, enumeration, analysis, and
		optimization of arranging discrete objects.

	<h2>Enumeration</h2>
	<p>
		In these next few sections, we explore the basics of
		<span class="italicsText">enumeration</span>, the formal term for what we
		think of when we hear the word &#8220;counting.&#8221; The concept of
		counting things might seem intuitive, but looks can be deceiving. Many
		counting problems require us to first determine (a)
		<span class="italicsText">what</span> exactly it is we are counting, and (b)
		<span class="italicsText">how</span> we should count. It is these problems
		that concern the next sections.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose on August 1, a friend says, &#8220;We'll meet in a
		week.&#8221; Does the friend mean, August 7 or August 8? Both meanings are
		plausible. If we count August 1, then:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>If, however, we do not count August 1, then:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of what we call an
		<span class="term">indexing problem</span> &mdash; where do we start the
		count? In reality, indexing depends enormously on convention. In the
		English-speaking world, if at 10:00 a.m. the lecturer says, &#8220;We'll
		meet again in 2 hours&#8221; they almost assuredly mean, &#8220;Reconvene at
		12:00 p.m.&#8221;
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[10, 11, 12]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At its core, every counting issue boils down to a deceptively simple
		question: &#8220;What do we count?&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		In many programming languages, if an array contains 4 elements, then the
		third element in the array is actually element number 2, because the count
		starts at 0:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<p>How many numbers are in this sequence:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Clearly, there are 10 numbers. This is a very basic counting problem, and it
		is what we think of when hear the word &#8220;counting&#8221;. Now, how many
		numbers are between 8 and 16 inclusive (i.e., including 8 and 16)?:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We could manually count each element. But, that approach is inefficient,
		particularly for very long sequences. A better way would be to simplify
		sequence into the one we saw previously:
	</p>
	<figure>
		$$ \begin{aligned} (8-7) &= 1, \\ (9-7) &= 2, \\ (10-7) &= 3, \\ (11-7) &=
		4, \\ (12-7) &= 5, \\ (13-7) &= 6, \\ (14-7) &= 7, \\ (15-7) &= 8, \\ (16-7)
		&= 9, \\ \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		From this approach, we can see that given two positive numbers ${a}$ and
		${b}$ where ${b > a,}$ the number of integers in the sequence ${[a, a+1,
		\ldots, b-1, b]}$ is: ${(b - a) + 1.}$
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proposition.</span> Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be integers,
			where ${b > a.}$ Given a sequence ${L = [a, a+1, \ldots, b-1, b],}$ the
			number of elements in the sequence, ${n(L),}$ is given by:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${n(L) = (b - a) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<p>
		We can use the proposition above for even more complex problems. For
		example, how many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, we know the first multiple of three between 62 and 215 is 63. The last
		multiple of three is 213. Thus, the actual array we want to count is ${63,
		66, 69, \ldots, 213.}$ Now, we need to convert this array into one we know
		how to count, so we divide each element in the array by 3: ${21, 22, 23,
		\ldots , 71.}$ From our previous proposition, we know how to count this
		array: ${(71 - 21) + 1 = 51.}$ Thus, there are 51 numbers in the array
		&mdash; i.e., there are 51 multiples of 3 between 62 and 215.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's try another one. How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101?
		Again, the first multiple of 10 is 10. The last multiple of 10 is 100. Thus,
		the sequence is ${[10, 20, \ldots, 100].}$ We divide by 10: ${[1, 2, 3,
		\ldots, 10].}$ And again, we know how to count this sequence: ${(10 - 1) + 1
		= 10.}$ There are 10 multiples of 10 between 9 and 101.
	</p>
	<p>
		How many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103? Here, the first multiple of
		10 is 20. The last multiple of 10 is 100. We have the sequence ${[20, 30,
		\ldots, 100].}$ Dividing by 3: ${[2, 3, 4, \ldots, 10.]}$ Then counting:
		${(10-2) + 1 = 9.}$ There are 9 multiples of 10 between 11 and 103.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that we know how to count multiples, we can start counting even more
		elaborate sequences: How many four-digit positive integers are perfect
		cubes?
	</p>
	<p>
		Solution: We know that the first four-digit positive integer that is a
		perfect cube is ${10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000.}$ The last four-digit perfect
		cube is a bit trickier to find. Fortunately, the method of exhaustion is
		feasible here. We know ${20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 8000.}$ This is already
		pretty close to five-digits, so let's just try the next positive integer:
		${21 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 = 9,261.}$ Now we're very close; 22 will probably
		enter five-digit territory: ${22 \cdot 22 \cdot 22 = 10,648.}$ Great, so we
		know our sequence is ${[1000, \ldots, 9261].}$ Taking the cubic root of each
		element, we have ${[10, \ldots, 21.]}$ Counting this list: ${(21 - 10) + 1 =
		12.}$ Hence, there are 12 four-digit positive integers that are perfect
		cubes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's consider another interesting example. There are four villages, ${A,}$
		${B,}$ ${C,}$ and ${D.}$ Each line represents a path between the villages.
		How many ways are there to go from ${A}$ to ${D}$ along the paths, if one
		can only move left to right? (I.e., one cannot move ${ABABABACD;}$ only
		${ACD}$ or ${ABD}$).
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/counting_graph.svg' %}"
			alt="4 nodes, 4 edges"
			class="forty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
		<figcaption>Note the arrows.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is another counting problem. First, observe the number of paths between
		each village. Between ${A}$ and ${C,}$ there are 2 paths, and between ${A}$
		and ${C,}$ there are 5 paths. Accordingly, there are 10 possible paths if we
		take the route ${ACD.}$ Now consider the route ${ABD.}$ From ${A}$ to ${B,}$
		there are 4 possible paths, and from ${B}$ to ${D,}$ there are 3 possible
		paths. Hence, there are 12 possible paths for taking the route ${ABD.}$ In
		total, there are ${10 + 12 = 22}$ possible paths from ${A}$ to ${D.}$

				How many odd perfect squares are between 5 and 211?
				<details class="answer">
					<summary>Solution</summary>
					<p>
						Again, let's come up with a sequence. First, let's find the first
						element. The first element is 9: ${3^2 = 9.}$ Now let's find the
						last element. We know ${12^2 = 144.}$ So just a little higher.
						${13^2 = 169.}$ ${15 \times 15 = 225;}$ too high. ${14^2 = 196,}$
						but this is even. So, the first element is 9, and the last element
						is 169. Thus, we have ${[9, 25, 49, 81, \ldots 196].}$ Taking the
						square root each element: ${[3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots , 13.]}$ Subtracting
						1 from each element: ${[2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots , 12.]}$ Dividing each

				How many sets of four consecutive positive integers are there such that
				the product of the four integers is less than 100,000?
				<details class="answer">
					<summary>Solution</summary>
					<p>
						First, the smallest element in this sequence is ${[1, 2, 3, 4] = 1
						\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24}$ (remember, we're looking for
						consecutive positive integers). Now, we have to look for the largest
						set. Let's focus on the value 100,000.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're looking for four numbers that when multiplied together produce
						100,000. Let's look at a simpler case, a number to the power of 4.
						We know that ${20^4 = 160,000.}$ Let's try another number: ${19^4 =
						130,321.}$ Getting a little closer. ${18^4 = 104,976.}$ This is
						pretty close, so the last number has to be immediately next to 18.
						Let's try another one: ${17^4 = 83,521.}$ This is lower than
						100,000. This means the set of four integers is somewhere in the
						vicinity of 17 and 18. Let's try: ${15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 =
						73,440.}$ Close, but let's just try one more: ${16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18
						\cdot 19 = 93,024;}$ include 20 in the next set and we are
						definitely over 100,000. Thus, this is definitely the last element.
						Great, this means we have the following:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<div>
							<p>${M = [\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \ldots, \{16, 17, 18, 19\}]}$</p>

					<p>
						Now, the question is how do we count these? Well, let's think about
						how each of these sets work:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<div>
							<p>${ \{ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \} }$</p>
							<p>${\vdots}$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \} }$</p>
							<p>${ \{ 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 \} }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						If we focus on just the first number for each of the sets above, we
						get: ${1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 15, 16.}$ Thus, there are 16 different
						possible sets.

	<p>
		Counting is deeply intertwined with arithmetic. Consider the following
		problem:
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			12 students are taking at least 1 foreign language. The school offers only
			Spanish and French. 8 students take Spanish, 5 take both Spanish and
			French. How many students take French?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but the worst possible way
		is to blindly add and subtract. We want to think as logically as possible.
		More importantly, we want to think about this problem in terms of set
		theory. Here, we have a situation where students take Spanish, French, or
		both Spanish and French. The problem can be viewed as sets intersecting,
		where ${F = \text{French},}$ ${S = \text{Spanish}:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/french_and_spanish.svg' %}"
			alt="int"
			loading="lazy"
			class="sixty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The Venn diagram above can be thought of as representing several sections:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${F \cup S}$ = {all students}</p>
			<p>${F}$ = {all French students}</p>
			<p>${S}$ = {all Spanish students}</p>
			<p>${F \cap S}$ = {students taking French and Spanish}</p>
			<p>${F \setminus S}$ = {students taking only French}</p>
			<p>${S \setminus F}$ = {students taking only Spanish}</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here, we are asked to find ${n(F).}$ We have the following data:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(F \cup S) = 12}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 8}$</p>
			<p>${n(F \cap S) = 5}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What else can we infer from this data? Well, we know that ${n(F \cap S) =
		5.}$ These are the students that take both Spanish and French. Next, we know
		${n(S) = 8;}$ there are 8 total students taking Spanish. Thus, we can make
		the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \setminus F) = n(S) - n(F \cap S) = 8 - 5 = 3.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, there are 3 students that take only Spanish. How many students take
		only French? Well, it must be 4, since ${n(F \cup S) - n(S) = 12 - 8 = 4.}$
		Hence, ${n(F) = n(F \setminus S) + n(F \cap S) = 4 + 5 = 9.}$
	</p>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			Agnes has 27 cats. 14 cats are short-haired. 11 cats are kittens. 5 cats
			are long-haired adult cats (not kittens). How many short-haired kittens?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Again, set theory allows us to think about this as logically as possible.
		Here, we have several sets from the data above:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${S}$ = short-hairs</p>
			<p>${L}$ = long-hairs</p>
			<p>${K}$ = kittens</p>
			<p>${A}$ = adults</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The problem gives us the following data, and the last line is what we want
		to find:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \cup L) = n(A \cup K)}$ = total cats = 27</p>
			<p>${n(S) = n(K \cup S) + n(A \cup S)}$</p>
			<p>${n(L) = n(K \cup L) + n(A \cup L)}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 14}$</p>
			<p>${n(K) = 11}$</p>
			<p>${n(L \cap A) = 5}$</p>
			<p>${n(K \cap S) = ?}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		First, we know that ${n(K \cup A) = 27.}$ We also know that ${n(K) = 11.}$
		Thus, ${n(A) = n(K \cup A) - n(K) = 27 - 11 = 16.}$ There are 16 adults.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that ${n(L \cap A) = 5,}$ so ${n(A \cap S) = n(A) - n(A \cap L) = 16
		- 5 = 11.}$ There are 11 short-hair adults. Now, we know ${n(S) = 14,}$ and
		we know that ${n(S) = n(K \cap S) + n(A \cap S).}$ Hence, ${n(K \cap S) =
		n(S) - n(A \cap S) = 14 - 11 = 3.}$ Therefore, there are 3 short-hair
		kittens.

	<h2>The Product Rule</h2>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">

	<p>
		This is a basic counting problem. Suppose the women are Jane, Binita, Yuna,

		There are 8 possible outcomes. This corresponds to the following principle:

				<details class="answer">
					<summary>Solution</summary>
					<p>
						When dealing with problems involving abstractions, it's often best
						to consider a simpler, concrete case first. Suppose the function is
						called ${f.}$ Next, instead of considering ${n}$ points, suppose
						there is just 1 point. With just 1 point, we have ${f(1) = -1,}$
						${f(1) = 0,}$ ${f(1) = \texttt{null}.}$ This means that with just 1
						point, we have 3 possible functions. Because we're dealing with a
						function, the value after ${f(1)}$ &mdash; the value of ${f(2)}$
						&mdash; could be either ${-1,}$ ${0,}$ or ${\texttt{null}.}$ This
						means that we have ${3 \cdot 3 = 3^2 = 9}$ possible functions. With
						3 points, we have ${3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 3^3 = 27.}$ Expanding on
						this thought process, there are ${3^n}$ possible functions.

<section id="using_the_sum_rule_and_product_rule_together">
	<h2>Using the Sum & Product Rules Together</h2>
	<p>
		While the sum and product rules are useful tools for counting, they are
		limited. Often, a counting problem requires using both rules for a solution.
		For example, consider the following problem:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				A computer language ${X}$ permits variable names according to the
				following rules:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The variable name is a string of one or two alphanumeric characters
					(an <span class="italicsText">alphanumeric character</span> is a
					character that is either one of the 26 English letters or one of the
					10 digits).
				</li>
				<li>Uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished.</li>
				<li>The variable name must begin with a letter.</li>
				<li>
					The variable name must not be one of the five strings of two
					characters reserved by the language.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>How many different variable names are possible in ${X?}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Solving this problem requires applying both the sum and product rules.
		First, let's denote the set of all possible variable names as ${V.}$ The set
		${V}$ consists of two subsets: ${V_1,}$ the set of all possible variable
		names with a single character, and the set ${V_2,}$ the set of all possible
		variable names with two characters. The problem essentially asks us to
		determine ${n(V),}$ which is ${n(V_1) + n(V_2).}$
	</p>
	<p>
		We first determine ${n(V_1).}$ Our immediate constraint is that the variable
		name must begin with a letter. Thus, for the first character, there are
		${26}$ choices (uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished). This
		takes care of the first character and determines the number of possible
		variable names of a single character: ${26.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, we determine ${n(V_2).}$ The second character can be either one of the
		26 English letters or one of the 10 digits. Applying the sum rule, there are
		36 possible choices for each of the 26 choices for the first character. But,
		five of these choices will result in a reserved string, so we must subtract
		${5}$ from ${36:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${26 \times (36 - 5) = 931}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, because the variable name can be either one or two characters, the
		number of variable names is given by the sum rule:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(V) = n(V_1) + n(V_2) = 26 + 931 = 957}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Hence, there are ${957}$ possible variable names in ${X.}$ Not a
		particularly expressive language.
	</p>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				A website requires its users to choose a password that is six to eight
				characters long. Each character in the password must be either an
				uppercase letter or a digit. Each password must contain at least one
				digit. How many possible passwords are there?
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		First, we denote the set of all passwords as ${P.}$ The set ${P}$ consists
		of three subsets: ${P_6,}$ the set of all passwords ${6}$ characters long,
		${P_7,}$ the set of all passwords ${7}$ characters long, and ${P_8,}$ the
		set of all passwords ${8}$ characters long. The number of possible passwords
		then is:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(P) = n(P_6) + n(P_7) + n(P_8)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We first consider ${n(P_6).}$ This is where we run into difficulty. The
		constraint that each password must contain at least one digit doesn't help
		as much, at least directly. The password could be all digits, some letters
		and one digit, some letters and two digits, and so on. Accordingly, we must
		find ${n(P_6)}$ indirectly. To do so, we first determine the number of
		6-character strings consisting of letters and digits, and then we determine
		the number of 6-character strings with no digits. If we subtract these two
		numbers, we have a set of 6-character character strings where no string is
		consists entirely of letters. Fortunately, these are a straightforward
		applications of the product rule:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} n(P_6) &= 36^6 - 26^6 \\ &= 2~176~782~336 - 308~915~776
			\\ &= 1~867~866~560 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Applying the same analysis to ${P_7:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} n(P_7) &= 36^7 - 26^7 \\ &= 78~364~164~096 -
			8~031~810~176 \\ &= 70~332~353~920 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>And to ${P_8:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} n(P_8) &= 36^8 - 26^8 \\ &= 2~821~109~907~456 -
			208~827~064~576 \\ &= 2~612~282~842~880 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Hence, there are:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} n(P) &= n(P_6) + n(P_7) + n(P_8) \\ &= 1~867~866~560 +
			70~332~353~920 + 2~612~282~842~880 \\ &= 2~684~483~063~360 \end{aligned}
			$$

<section id="the_subtraction_rule">
	<h2>The Subtraction Rule</h2>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				How many bit strings 8 bits long begin with a ${1}$ or end with the two
				bits ${00?}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We cannot directly solve this problem with the sum and product rules alone.
		But, we can try and reason our way through it. First, from the facts, we
		have two possible choices: (1) The bit string starts with a ${1,}$ or (2)
		the bit string ends with ${00.}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>Choice (1): <span class="monoText">1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _</span></p>
			<p>Choice (2): <span class="monoText">_ _ _ _ _ _ 0 0</span></p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For choice (1), there are 7 slots available, so we have ${2^7 = 128}$
		possible strings. For choice (2), there are 6 slots available, so we have
		${2^6 = 64}$ possible strings. Both of these conclusions follow from the
		product rule.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rub, however, is that some of the possibilities for (1) and (2) are the
		same. Namely, these are the strings that begin with ${1}$ and end with
		${00:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>In both (1) and (2): <span class="monoText">1 _ _ _ _ _ 0 0</span></p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we simply added the possibilities of choices (1) and (2), we would be
		counting these possibilities twice. Accordingly, we must subtract the
		possibilities where the string begins with ${1}$ and ends with ${00.}$ There
		are five slots empty, so there are ${2^5 = 32}$ of such possibilities.
		Hence, there are:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${128 + 64 - 32 = 160}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

		possibilities, the arrangement consists of red and white bricks.
		Accordingly, to find the number of possibilities, we simply divide the total
		number of possibilities by the number of possibilities for red bricks times
		the number of possibilities for the white bricks:
