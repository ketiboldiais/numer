<h1>Combinatorics</h1>
<section>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>John plays a video game where there are 50 characters to chose from. John must construct a team of characters. The team can only consist of 5 unique characters, selected from the 50 characters. How many different teams can John construct?</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>This is an example of a <span class="term">combinatorics</span> problem. Combinatorics is the study of <span class="italicsText">combinations</span>, or <span class="italicsText">arrangements</span>, of discrete objects. By and large, questions in combinatorics fall into a few categories:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li><span class="topic">Existence.</span> Given some things and a set of conditions, does a particular arrangement ${x}$ exist?</li>
			<li><span class="topic">Enumeration.</span> How many different ways are there to arrange these things given this set of conditions?</li>
			<li><span class="topic">Analysis.</span> What are the properties, or characteristics, of this particular arrangement?</li>
			<li><span class="topic">Optimization.</span> Given all these different arrangements, what is the most optimal?</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>Not every combinatorics problem falls into the categories above, and of those that do, they may not fit so neatly. The categorization presented is intended to be illustrative, rather than comprehensive. However, many of the most useful ideas in combinatorics stem from the aforementioned questions, and it is these ideas that we explore. Accordingly, for our purposes, combinatorics is the study of the existence, enumeration, analysis, and optimization of arranging discrete objects.</p>
