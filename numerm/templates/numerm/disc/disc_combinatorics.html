<h1>Combinatorics</h1>
<section>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				John plays a video game where there are 50 characters to chose from.
				John must construct a team of characters. The team can only consist of 5
				unique characters, selected from the 50 characters. How many different
				teams can John construct?
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of a <span class="term">combinatorics</span> problem.
		Combinatorics is the study of <span class="italicsText">combinations</span>,
		or <span class="italicsText">arrangements</span>, of discrete objects. By
		and large, questions in combinatorics fall into a few categories:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Existence.</span> Given some things and a set of
				conditions, does a particular arrangement ${x}$ exist?
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Enumeration.</span> How many different ways are
				there to arrange these things given this set of conditions?
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Analysis.</span> What are the properties, or
				characteristics, of this particular arrangement?
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="topic">Optimization.</span> Given all these different
				arrangements, what is the most optimal?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Not every combinatorics problem falls into the categories above, and of
		those that do, they may not fit so neatly. The categorization presented is
		intended to be illustrative, rather than comprehensive. However, many of the
		most useful ideas in combinatorics stem from the aforementioned questions,
		and it is these ideas that we explore. Accordingly, for our purposes,
		combinatorics is the study of the existence, enumeration, analysis, and
		optimization of arranging discrete objects.

	<h2>Enumeration</h2>
	<p>
		In these next few sections, we explore the basics of
		<span class="italicsText">enumeration</span>, the formal term for what we
		think of when we hear the word &#8220;counting.&#8221; The concept of
		counting things might seem intuitive, but looks can be deceiving. Many
		counting problems require us to first determine (a)
		<span class="italicsText">what</span> exactly it is we are counting, and (b)
		<span class="italicsText">how</span> we should count. It is these problems
		that concern the next sections.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose on August 1, a friend says, &#8220;We'll meet in a
		week.&#8221; Does the friend mean, August 7 or August 8? Both meanings are
		plausible. If we count August 1, then:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>If, however, we do not count August 1, then:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of what we call an
		<span class="term">indexing problem</span> &mdash; where do we start the
		count? In reality, indexing depends enormously on convention. In the
		English-speaking world, if at 10:00 a.m. the lecturer says, &#8220;We'll
		meet again in 2 hours&#8221; they almost assuredly mean, &#8220;Reconvene at
		12:00 p.m.&#8221;
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[10, 11, 12]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		At its core, every counting issue boils down to a deceptively simple
		question: &#8220;What do we count?&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		In many programming languages, if an array contains 4 elements, then the
		third element in the array is actually element number 2, because the count
		starts at 0:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<p>How many numbers are in this sequence:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Clearly, there are 10 numbers. This is a very basic counting problem, and it
		is what we think of when hear the word &#8220;counting&#8221;. Now, how many
		numbers are between 8 and 16 inclusive (i.e., including 8 and 16)?:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We could manually count each element. But, that approach is inefficient,
		particularly for very long sequences. A better way would be to simplify
		sequence into the one we saw previously:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				$[ (8-7), (9-7), (10-7), (11-7), (12-7), (13-7), (14-7), (15-7), (16-7)
				]$
			</p>
		</div>
		<div><p>${\text{\textbardbl}}$</p></div>
		<div><p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}$</p></div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From this approach, we can see that given two positive numbers ${a}$ and
		${b}$ where ${b > a,}$ the number of integers in the sequence ${[a, a+1,
		\ldots, b-1, b]}$ is: ${(b - a) + 1.}$
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proposition.</span> Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be integers,
			where ${b > a.}$ Given a sequence ${L = [a, a+1, \ldots, b-1, b],}$ the
			number of elements in the sequence, ${n(L),}$ is given by:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${n(L) = (b - a) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<p>
		We can use the proposition above for even more complex problems. For
		example, how many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, we know the first multiple of three between 62 and 215 is 63. The last
		multiple of three is 213. Thus, the actual array we want to count is ${63,
		66, 69, \ldots, 213.}$ Now, we need to convert this array into one we know
		how to count, so we divide each element in the array by 3: ${21, 22, 23,
		\ldots , 71.}$ From our previous proposition, we know how to count this
		array: ${(71 - 21) + 1 = 51.}$ Thus, there are 51 numbers in the array
		&mdash; i.e., there are 51 multiples of 3 between 62 and 215.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's try another one. How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101?
		Again, the first multiple of 10 is 10. The last multiple of 10 is 100. Thus,
		the sequence is ${[10, 20, \ldots, 100].}$ We divide by 10: ${[1, 2, 3,
		\ldots, 10].}$ And again, we know how to count this sequence: ${(10 - 1) + 1
		= 10.}$ There are 10 multiples of 10 between 9 and 101.
	</p>
	<p>
		How many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103? Here, the first multiple of
		10 is 20. The last multiple of 10 is 100. We have the sequence ${[20, 30,
		\ldots, 100].}$ Dividing by 3: ${[2, 3, 4, \ldots, 10.]}$ Then counting:
		${(10-2) + 1 = 9.}$ There are 9 multiples of 10 between 11 and 103.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that we know how to count multiples, we can start counting even more
		elaborate sequences: How many four-digit positive integers are perfect
		cubes?
	</p>
	<p>
		Solution: We know that the first four-digit positive integer that is a
		perfect cube is ${10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000.}$ The last four-digit perfect
		cube is a bit trickier to find. Fortunately, the method of exhaustion is
		feasible here. We know ${20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 8000.}$ This is already
		pretty close to five-digits, so let's just try the next positive integer:
		${21 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 = 9,261.}$ Now we're very close; 22 will probably
		enter five-digit territory: ${22 \cdot 22 \cdot 22 = 10,648.}$ Great, so we
		know our sequence is ${[1000, \ldots, 9261].}$ Taking the cubic root of each
		element, we have ${[10, \ldots, 21.]}$ Counting this list: ${(21 - 10) + 1 =
		12.}$ Hence, there are 12 four-digit positive integers that are perfect
		cubes.

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many numbers are in the following

		<li>${L = [36, 37, 38, \ldots , 92, 93]}$</li>
		<details class="answer">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
				We use the relevant proposition: ${(93 - 36) + 1 = 58.}$ There are 58

		<li>${N = [4, 6, 8, \ldots, 128, 130]}$</li>
		<details class="answer">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
				Again, we convert the sequence into one we can actually count. We can
				see each element is a multiple of 2. Thus, the sequence is: ${[(4/2),
				(6/2), (8/2), \ldots, (128/2), (130/2)].}$ Simplifying: ${2, 3, 4,
				\ldots, 64, 65.}$ Using the proposition: ${(65 - 2) + 1 = 64.}$ Thus,

		<details class="answer">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
				Again, we convert the sequence into one we can count. We can see that
				each element in the sequence differs by 5. To simplify the sequence so
				we can divide by 5, let's add 3 to each element: ${[-30, -25, -20,
				\ldots, 55, 60.]}$ Now let's divide by 5: ${-6, -5, -4, \ldots, 11,
				12.}$ Using our formula: ${(12 - (-6)) + 1 = 19.}$ Thus, ${n(S) = 19.}$

			<p>
				In this sequence, we can see each element differs by 3. Let's try
				subtracting 9 from each element: ${[30, 33, \ldots , 132, 135, 138.]}$
				Reverse the list and divde by 3: ${[10, 11, \ldots, 44, 45, 46.]}$ Using

		</li>
		<details class="answer">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
				We can see each element differs by ${\frac{2}{3}.}$ Let's try and give
				all of the elements a common denominator: ${[\frac{11}{3}, \frac{13}{3},
				\frac{15}{3}, \ldots, \frac{79}{3}, \frac{81}{3}].}$ Since each of the
				elements has a multiplier of ${\frac{1}{3},}$ we can factor
				${\frac{1}{3}}$ out, leaving us with: ${[11, 13, 15, \ldots, 79, 81.]}$
				These are all separated by 2, so let's subtract 1 to each element:
				${[10, 12, 14, \ldots, 78, 80];}$ then divide by 2: ${[5, 6, 7, \ldots,
				39, 40.]}$ We can count this list: ${(40-5) + 1 = 36.}$ Thus, ${n(C) =
				36.}$

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many odd perfect squares are between
		5 and 211?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			Again, let's come up with a sequence. First, let's find the first element.
			The first element is 9: ${3^2 = 9.}$ Now let's find the last element. We
			know ${12^2 = 144.}$ So just a little higher. ${13^2 = 169.}$ ${15 \times
			15 = 225;}$ too high. ${14^2 = 196,}$ but this is even. So, the first
			element is 9, and the last element is 169. Thus, we have ${[9, 25, 49, 81,
			\ldots 196].}$ Taking the square root each element: ${[3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots
			, 13.]}$ Subtracting 1 from each element: ${[2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots , 12.]}$
			Dividing each element by 2: ${[1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 6.]}$ Thus, there are 6

	<p>
		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many sets of four consecutive
		positive integers are there such that the product of the four integers is
		less than 100,000?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			First, the smallest element in this sequence is ${[1, 2, 3, 4] = 1 \cdot 2
			\cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24}$ (remember, we're looking for consecutive positive
			integers). Now, we have to look for the largest set. Let's focus on the
			value 100,000.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're looking for four numbers that when multiplied together produce
			100,000. Let's look at a simpler case, a number to the power of 4. We know
			that ${20^4 = 160,000.}$ Let's try another number: ${19^4 = 130,321.}$
			Getting a little closer. ${18^4 = 104,976.}$ This is pretty close, so the
			last number has to be immediately next to 18. Let's try another one:
			${17^4 = 83,521.}$ This is lower than 100,000. This means the set of four
			integers is somewhere in the vicinity of 17 and 18. Let's try: ${15 \cdot
			16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 = 73,440.}$ Close, but let's just try one more: ${16
			\cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 = 93,024;}$ include 20 in the next set and we
			are definitely over 100,000. Thus, this is definitely the last element.
			Great, this means we have the following:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${M = [\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \ldots, \{16, 17, 18, 19\}]}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Now, the question is how do we count these? Well, let's think about how
			each of these sets work:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${ \{ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \} }$</p>
				<p>${\vdots}$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 \} }$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			If we focus on just the first number for each of the sets above, we get:
			${1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 15, 16.}$ Thus, there are 16 different possible
			sets.
		</p>
	</details>
	<p>
		Counting is deeply intertwined with arithmetic. Consider the following
		problem:
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			12 students are taking at least 1 foreign language. The school offers only
			Spanish and French. 8 students take Spanish, 5 take both Spanish and
			French. How many students take French?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but the worst possible way
		is to blindly add and subtract. We want to think as logically as possible.
		More importantly, we want to think about this problem in terms of set
		theory. Here, we have a situation where students take Spanish, French, or
		both Spanish and French. The problem can be viewed as sets intersecting,
		where ${F = \text{French},}$ ${S = \text{Spanish}:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/french_and_spanish.svg' %}"
			alt="int"
			loading="lazy"
			class="sixty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The Venn diagram above can be thought of as representing several sections:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${F \cup S}$ = {all students}</p>
			<p>${F}$ = {all French students}</p>
			<p>${S}$ = {all Spanish students}</p>
			<p>${F \cap S}$ = {students taking French and Spanish}</p>
			<p>${F \setminus S}$ = {students taking only French}</p>
			<p>${S \setminus F}$ = {students taking only Spanish}</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here, we are asked to find ${n(F).}$ We have the following data:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(F \cup S) = 12}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 8}$</p>
			<p>${n(F \cap S) = 5}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What else can we infer from this data? Well, we know that ${n(F \cap S) =
		5.}$ These are the students that take both Spanish and French. Next, we know
		${n(S) = 8;}$ there are 8 total students taking Spanish. Thus, we can make
		the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \setminus F) = n(S) - n(F \cap S) = 8 - 5 = 3.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, there are 3 students that take only Spanish. How many students take
		only French? Well, it must be 4, since ${n(F \cup S) - n(S) = 12 - 8 = 4.}$
		Hence, ${n(F) = n(F \setminus S) + n(F \cap S) = 4 + 5 = 9.}$
	</p>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			Agnes has 27 cats. 14 cats are short-haired. 11 cats are kittens. 5 cats
			are long-haired adult cats (not kittens). How many short-haired kittens?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Again, set theory allows us to think about this as logically as possible.
		Here, we have several sets from the data above:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${S}$ = short-hairs</p>
			<p>${L}$ = long-hairs</p>
			<p>${K}$ = kittens</p>
			<p>${A}$ = adults</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The problem gives us the following data, and the last line is what we want
		to find:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \cup L) = n(A \cup K)}$ = total cats = 27</p>
			<p>${n(S) = n(K \cup S) + n(A \cup S)}$</p>
			<p>${n(L) = n(K \cup L) + n(A \cup L)}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 14}$</p>
			<p>${n(K) = 11}$</p>
			<p>${n(L \cap A) = 5}$</p>
			<p>${n(K \cap S) = ?}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		First, we know that ${n(K \cup A) = 27.}$ We also know that ${n(K) = 11.}$
		Thus, ${n(A) = n(K \cup A) - n(K) = 27 - 11 = 16.}$ There are 16 adults.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that ${n(L \cap A) = 5,}$ so ${n(A \cap S) = n(A) - n(A \cap L) = 16
		- 5 = 11.}$ There are 11 short-hair adults. Now, we know ${n(S) = 14,}$ and
		we know that ${n(S) = n(K \cap S) + n(A \cap S).}$ Hence, ${n(K \cap S) =
		n(S) - n(A \cap S) = 14 - 11 = 3.}$ Therefore, there are 3 short-hair
		kittens.

	<h2>Counting Outcomes</h2>
	<p>Consider the following problem:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

		This is a basic counting problem. Suppose the women are Jane, Binita, Yuna,

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> A university identifies its members with
		an identification string. The string consists of 7 characters, of which the
		first 3 characters must be an English alphabet, and the last 4 characters
		must be numbers (e.g., <span class="monoText">AXX7980</span>). How many
		possible strings are there?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>There are 26 English alphabets, and there 10 possible numbers. Thus:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Suppose a graph consists of ${n}$ points.
		How many different functions are defined on these ${n}$ points if each
		function is either ${0,}$ ${1,}$ or ${\texttt{null}?}$
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			When dealing with problems involving abstractions, it's often best to
			consider a simpler, concrete case first. Suppose the function is called
			${f.}$ Next, instead of considering ${n}$ points, suppose there is just 1
			point. With just 1 point, we have ${f(1) = -1,}$ ${f(1) = 0,}$ ${f(1) =
			\texttt{null}.}$ This means that with just 1 point, we have 3 possible
			functions. Because we're dealing with a function, the value after ${f(1)}$
			&mdash; the value of ${f(2)}$ &mdash; could be either ${-1,}$ ${0,}$ or
			${\texttt{null}.}$ This means that we have ${3 \cdot 3 = 3^2 = 9}$
			possible functions. With 3 points, we have ${3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 3^3 =
			27.}$ Expanding on this thought process, there are ${3^n}$ possible
			functions.

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Blackacre Corp. has two divisions,
		software and hardware. Blackacre owns a building with 12 floors. Assuming
		Blackacre will assign 1 floor to each division, how many different ways are
		there to assign different floors to each division?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			There are 12 possible floors to assign to software (or hardware), leaving
			11 possible floors for the other. Accordingly, there are ${12 \times 11 =

	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			There are 26 letters in the alphabet, and 100 positive integers no greater

	<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many different bit strings of length 12 are there?</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>A bit is either a 0 or a 1. Accordingly, for a bit of length 1, there are two possibilities: 0 or 1. For a bit string of length 2, there are 4 possibilities: 00, 01, 10, 11. For a bit string of length 3, there are 9. And so on. Thus, for a bit string of length 12, there are ${2^{12},}$ or ${4096,}$ bit strings.</p>
