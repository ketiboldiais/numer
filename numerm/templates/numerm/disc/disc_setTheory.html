<h1>Set Theory</h1>
<section id="set_theory">
	<p>
		There are two versions of set theory: (1)
		<span class="term">naive set theory</span>, and (2)
		<span class="term">axiomatic set theory</span>. We explore aspects of both
		theories in the materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set
		theory is the version of set theory as originally constructed by the German
		mathematician Georg Cantor.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>When Cantor first introduced set theory, the math community largely
			ridiculed him. Over time, however, the theory gained big-name
			mathematicians like David Hilbert. Nevertheless, the ridicule remained and
			affected Cantor deeply. Comments at the time captured the split: David
			Hilbert famously said, "No one will drive us from the paradise which
			Cantor created for us." To which Wittgenstein&mdash;a philosopher and one
			of Hilbert's most formidable opponents&mdash;responded, "If one person can
			see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not another see it as a
			joke?"</span
		>
		Axiomatic set theory is the version of set theory constructed in response to
		several paradoxes, the most famous of which is
		<span class="term">Russell's Paradox</span>. Axiomatic set theory itself
		consists of several versions &mdash;
		<span class="term">Zermelo set theory</span> and
		<span class="term">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory</span>. The paradoxes these
		more modern theories attempted to resolve will appear as we explore the
		basic concepts of naive set theory.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematics, a <span class="boldText">set</span> is a collection of
		objects. Those objects might be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values,
		variables, or more abstractly, propositions. For example, the set of all
		coins includes nickels, sterling, and yen. The set of all countries includes
		Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We
		can visualize a set as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/set_intro.svg' %}"
			alt="simple set"
			class="sixty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
		are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
		<span class="term">member</span> of that set.
	</p>
	<p>
		We say that a set is <span class="term">well-defined</span> if, for any
		given ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of the set. For
		example, the set ${L = \{x \in \R \mid x > 4\}}$ is a well-defined set.
		Given any ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of ${L.}$ ${x}$
		must be a real number, and it must be greater than 4. The set ${G = \{ 1, 4,
		3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set. Is ${3.2}$ a
		member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a determination.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic">The Axiom of Extension</h2>
	<p>
		The
		<span class="term">axiom of extension</span> provides that a set is
		completely determined by what its elements are &mdash; it is irrelevant
		whether the elements are in order, or whether an element is listed more than
		once.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$,
		and the same set as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic">Subsets</h2>
	<p>
		Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called
		<span class="term">subsets</span>.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>A set consisting of only one member is called a
			<span class="term">singleton</span>.</span
		>
		For example, the set of all Herefords is a subset of the set of all cows,
		and the set of all bonobos is a subset of the set of all great apes. More
		formally:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. The
				set $A$ is a <span class="italicsText">subset</span> of $B$ if, and only
				if, <span class="underlineText">every</span> element of $A$ is also an
				element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ A \subseteq B }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x}$, if
		${x \in A}$, then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$ relationship
		with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$ contains
		${A.}$"
		<span class="marginnote"
			>${A \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B)}$</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ A \nsubseteq B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one
		element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is
		not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not
		an element of ${B.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		From the definition above, if we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is a subset
		of ${B,}$ we must show that if ${x}$ belongs to ${A,}$ then ${x}$ also
		belongs to ${B.}$ If we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is
		<span class="underlineText">not</span> a subset of ${B,}$ we must find a
		single ${x}$ that belongs to ${A}$ but does not belong to ${B.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The definition above implies that the empty set is a subset of all sets, and
		a given set is a subset of itself. This follows directly from the
		definition. The proposition ${\emptyset \subseteq A}$ if, for all ${x \in
		\emptyset,}$ ${x \in A.}$ Because the sufficient condition, ${x \in
		\emptyset}$ is false, it follows that ${x \in A}$ is true. This is an
		example of a <span class="term">vacuous proof</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The case of ${A \subseteq A}$ straightforward. Given that ${A}$ and ${A}$
		are the same sets, every ${x \in A}$ implies that ${x \in A.}$ Because the
		sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is true, it follows
		that ${A \subseteq A}$ by definition.
	</p>
	<h3>Proper Subsets</h3>
	<p>
		A subset is a general concept. When we say that ${A}$ is a
		&#8220;subset&#8221; of ${B,}$ we allow the possibility of ${A}$ and ${B}$
		being equal. For example, the set of all aardvarks is a subset of all
		Orycteropodidae, and the set of all Orycteropodidae is a subset of all
		Tubulidentata. However, aardvarks comprise all the members of
		Orycteropodidae, and Orycteropodidae comprise all the members of
		Tubulidentata. Thus, these sets are all equal, but are also subsets.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>In biology, a taxon (an instance of a taxonomy level, e.g., kingdom,
			phylum, class, etc.) with only one superset is called
			<span class="term">monotypic</span>. Aardvarks, the Albany pitcher plant,
			the hyacinth macaw, among others are all monotypic.</span
		>
		Now, if some extinct species of Orycteropodidae comes back to life or some
		new species is discovered, then the aardvarks would not comprise all of
		Orycteropodidae. In that situation, aardvarks are no longer
		<span class="italicsText">just</span> a subset of Orycteropodidae. We can
		still refer to aardvarks as a subset of Orycteropodidae, but we are now also
		permitted to more specifically say that aardvarks are a
		<span class="term">proper subset</span> of Orycteropodidae.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets.
				${A}$ is a <span class="term">proper subset</span> of ${B}$ if, and only
				if, every element of ${A}$ is in ${B,}$ but there is at least one
				element in $B$ that is not in $A$.
				<span class="marginnote"
					>${A \subset B \iff [\forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B) \land \exists

				>
				If $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, we write:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ A \subset B }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If ${A \subset B}$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of ${A}$ are
		elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of ${B}$ that is not an
		element of ${A.}$ We can also infer that all the elements of ${A}$ have some
		property in common that separate it from other subsets of ${B.}$
		<span class="marginnote"
			>A helpful way to distinguish between the two symbols is noticing how they
			share similarities to the symbols ${\leq}$ and ${<.}$ ${\subseteq }$ means
			"subset or equal" and ${\subset}$ means "subset but not equal;" the former
			is more general than the latter.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we
		write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ A \not\subset B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or $A
		\subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$.
	</p>
	<h3>The Empty Set</h3>
	<p>
		Some sets have no members. For example, the set of all living humans over a
		thousand years old is the empty set, because it contains no members (at
		least to the author's knowledge). By convention in mathematics, the null set
		${\emptyset}$ is a subset of every set, and is a proper subset of every set
		except itself (since the null set has no members).
	</p>
	<p>
		The empty set is both an interesting and useful concept to have. Proferred
		by George Boole, the empty set embodies the concept of
		<span class="italicsText">nothingness</span>. Nothingness is a difficult
		concept to think about, but as with many things in mathematics, the idea is
		encapsulated &mdash; abstracted away &mdash; into a single symbol:
		${\emptyset.}$ The abstraction allows us to reason about nothingness
		differently. Usually, when we think of filling an empty pint with beer, we
		tend to think that we are somehow negating the glass's emptiness; sort of
		&#8220;removing&#8221; the nothingness inside the pint. ${\emptyset,}$
		however, is a member of every set except itself. We cannot remove
		nothingness from the set of all natural numbers &mdash; it's always there.
	</p>
	<h3>Set Notation</h3>
	<p>
		To more efficiently discuss sets, mathematicians have come up with
		<span class="term">set notation</span>. Let's go over some of the most
		common notation.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose that ${S}$ is a set. The
				notation ${x \in S}$ means "${x}$ is an element of ${S}$."
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A set may be made more explicit through
		<span class="term">set roster notation</span>. For instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$
		is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If the set has too many
		elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example, the set of all integers
		from 0 to 100 may be written as: $\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise,
		the set of all positive integers may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can also specify sets in <span class="term">set builder notation</span>.
		Suppose that $S$ is a set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may
		or may not satisfy. We can define a new set that contains all the elements
		of $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \} }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
		refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
		some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
		"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				$$ \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{
				s.t. } P(x) \} $$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

			<p>${B = \{ 3, 2, 1 \}}$</p>
			<p>${C = \{ 2, 1, 3 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		By the axiom of extension, ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and ${C}$ all have the same
		elements. Observing this, we have the following definition:

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Two sets are

		From the definition above, given to sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ to prove that

		set is called the set's <span class="term">cardinality</span>.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>The term <span class="italicsText">cardinality</span> is derived from the
			term <span class="italicsText">cardinal number.</span></span
		>
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given a set ${A,}$ if there are
				exactly ${m}$ elements in ${A,}$ where ${m \in \N,}$ then ${A}$ is a

	<p>
		The notation ${n(A)}$ is not the only one way to denote cardinality. Some
		texts denote cardinality with ${\lvert A \rvert }$ and ${card(A).}$ We use
		${n(A)}$ because it is both concise and avoids any potential confusion with
		the use of ${\lvert \rvert }$ in classical algebra. Note that when analyzing
		cardinality, the axiom of extension applies. The set ${A = \{ 1, 1, 2 \}}$
		and ${B = \{ 1, 2 \}}$ are the same sets. Thus, both ${A}$ and ${B}$ have a
		cardinality of 2 (i.e., ${n(A) = n(B) = 2.}$)
	</p>
	<p>
		Another useful fact when handling cardinality: The empty set is the only set
		with a cardinality of 0. Thus, we have the following proposition:

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>

		Further note that because sets denote the number of elements in a set, for
		our purposes, we follow the axiom that cardinality can never be negative.

	<p>The complement of a set ${S}$ more generally refers to the set of all elements not contained in ${S.}$ If we have a defined universal set ${U}$ and ${A \subset U,}$ then the complement of ${A}$ is the set of all elements in ${U}$ that are not inside ${A.}$</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition: Complement.</span> Suppose ${U}$ is the universal set. The complement of the set ${A,}$ denoted ${\overline{\rm A},}$ is the <span class="italicsText">complement</span> of ${A}$ with respect to ${U.}$ Hence:</p>

	<h4>Cardinality of Unions</h4>
	<p>
		Working with set theory, knowing the size of a union is tremendously useful.
		However, we must be careful when counting the elements. Because ${A \cup B}$
		consists of all the elements in ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and the elements in both ${A}$
		and ${B,}$ the elements in both ${A}$ and ${B}$ are counted twice.
		Accordingly, we must subtract the intersection of ${A}$ and ${B}$ to
		retrieve the correct cardinality. This is called the
		<span class="term">principle of inclusion-exclusion</span>:

	<h2>Power Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Consider the set ${B = \{ 0, 1 \},}$ the set of binary digits. Using our
		definition of subsets, what are all the different possible subsets of ${B?}$
		We can lay them out:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol class="numd">
			<li>${\emptyset }$</li>
			<li>${\{ 0 \}}$</li>
			<li>${\{ 1 \}}$</li>
			<li>${\{ 0, 1 \}}$</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		There are four different possible subsets. Suppose we place all these
		possible subsets in an entirely new set:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\{ \emptyset, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \}, \{ 0, 1 \} \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We call the set above the <span class="term">power set</span> of ${B.}$ We
		denote the set above as such:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\mathcal{P}(B) = \{ \emptyset, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \}, \{ 0, 1 \} \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The symbol ${\mathcal{P}}$ is used in these notes, but other symbols are
		used throughout mathematics: ${\mathscr{P}, \mathbb{P}, \wp,}$ and a few
		others. Defining the power set more formally:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given a set ${S,}$ the

				${\mathcal{P}(S).}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		One peculiar application of the definition above is with the empty set. What
		is the size of the power set of ${\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)?}$ It is 1, since
		the only subset of ${\emptyset}$ is ${\{\emptyset\}.}$ Next, what is the
		size of the power set of ${ \{ \emptyset \}?}$ It is 2, since
		${\mathcal{P}(\{ \emptyset \}) = \{ \emptyset, \{ \emptyset \} \}.}$ If we
		continue this pattern:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)) = 1}$</p>
			<p>${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))) = 2}$</p>
			<p>${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)))) = 3}$</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))))) = 4}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))))))
				= 5}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)))))))

			</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))))))))

			</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)))))))))
				= 8}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset))))))))))
				= 9}$
			</p>
			<p>
				${n(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)))))))))))

	<p>
		The real number line is <span class="boldText">continuous</span> because it
		has no holes (i.e., areas where there is nothing). There are points all

<section id="ordered_pairs">
	<h2>Ordered Pairs</h2>
	<p>
		When set theory was first introduced, it faced a major issue &mdash; how do
		you represent ordered pairs? The axiom of extension renders order irrelevant
		for defining sets. For example, $\{ a, b \}$ is the same set as $\{ b, a
		\}$. This is problematic if we are referring specifically to "$a$ then b",
		rather than "$b$ then $a$."
	</p>
	<p>
		The patch was to define ordered pairs as sets. An ordered pair is a set of
		the form $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}$. The set has two elements: $\{ a \}$
		and $\{ a, b \}$. If $a \neq b$, then the two sets are distinct, and $a$ is
		in both sets but $b$ is not. With this definition, we can differentiate
		between $a$, and $b$. If $a = b$, then we can say that $a$ is both the first
		and second element of the pair.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, however, mathematicians learned that writing $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a,b
		\} \mid a = b \}$ was too cumbersome. So, the syntax was shortened: $(a,
		b)$.
	</p>
	<p>
		Formalizing the discussion above: Let $a$ and $b$ be elements. The notation
		$(a, b)$ means the <span class="boldText">ordered pair</span> consisting of
		$a$ and $b$ together, such that $a$ is the first element of the pair and $b$
		is the second element.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equality of Ordered Pairs.</span> Suppose $(a, b)$ and
		$(c, d)$ are ordered pairs. The ordered pairs are equal if, and only if, $a
		= c$ and $b = d$. Thus, the statement $(a, b) = (c, d)$ implies that $a = c$
		and $b = d$.

	<h2>Tuples</h2>

			While $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} $, let $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ be

			first $x_1$, second $x_2$, third $x_3$, and so on, up to $x_n$.

	</blockquote>

	<p>
		Ordered pairs are more generally called <span class="term">tuples</span>,
		specifically 2-tuples. In mathematics, a tuple is a finite list of
		<span class="underlineText">ordered</span> elements. An
		<span class="term">${n-}$tuple</span> is a sequence of ${n}$ elements, where
