<h1>Set Theory</h1>
<section id="set_theory">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">T</span>here are two versions of set theory: (1)
		<span class="term">naive set theory</span>, and (2)
		<span class="term">axiomatic set theory</span>. We explore aspects of both
		theories in the materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set
		theory is the version of set theory as originally constructed by the German
		mathematician Georg Cantor.<label for="canto" class="margin-toggle"

		<span class="marginnote"
			>When Cantor first introduced set theory, the math community largely
			ridiculed him. Over time, however, the theory gained big-name
			mathematicians like David Hilbert. Nevertheless, the ridicule remained and
			affected Cantor deeply. Comments at the time captured the split: David
			Hilbert famously said, "No one will drive us from the paradise which
			Cantor created for us." To which Wittgenstein&mdash;a philosopher and one
			of Hilbert's most formidable opponents&mdash;responded, "If one person can
			see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not another see it as a
			joke?"</span
		>
		Axiomatic set theory is the version of set theory constructed in response to
		several paradoxes, the most famous of which is
		<span class="italicsText">Russell's Paradox</span>. Axiomatic set theory
		itself consists of several versions &mdash;
		<span class="italicsText">Zermelo set theory</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory</span>. The paradoxes
		these more modern theories attempted to resolve will appear as we explore
		the basic concepts of naive set theory.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematics, a <span class="term">set</span> is a collection of objects.
		Those objects might be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values, variables, or
		more abstractly, propositions. For example, the set of all coins includes
		nickels, sterling, and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau,
		and Uruguay. The set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a
		set as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/set_intro.svg' %}"
			alt="simple set"
			class="sixty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
		are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
		<span class="term">member</span> of that set.
	</p>
	<p>
		We say that a set is <span class="term">well-defined</span> if, for any
		given ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of the set. For
		example, the set ${L = \{x \in \R \mid x > 4\}}$ is a well-defined set.
		Given any ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of ${L.}$ ${x}$
		must be a real number, and it must be greater than 4. The set ${G = \{ 1, 4,
		3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set. Is ${3.2}$ a
		member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a determination.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="axiom_of_extension">
	<h2 class="topic">The Axiom of Extension</h2>
	<p>
		The
		<span class="term">axiom of extension</span> provides that a set is
		completely determined by what its elements are &mdash; it is irrelevant
		whether the elements are in order, or whether an element is listed more than
		once.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$,
		and the same set as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="subsets">
	<h2 class="topic">Subsets</h2>
	<p>
		Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called
		<span class="term">subsets</span>.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>A set consisting of only one member is called a
			<span class="term">singleton</span>.</span
		>
		For example, the set of all Herefords is a subset of the set of all cows,
		and the set of all bonobos is a subset of the set of all great apes. More
		formally:

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets.
				The set ${A}$ is a <span class="italicsText">subset</span> of ${B}$ if,
				and only if, <span class="underlineText">every</span> element of ${A}$
				is also an element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ A \subseteq B }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x,}$ if
		${x \in A,}$ then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$ relationship
		with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$ contains
		${A.}$"
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in A \implies x \in B)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ A \nsubseteq B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one
		element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is
		not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not
		an element of ${B.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		From the definition above, if we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is a subset
		of ${B,}$ we must show that if ${x}$ belongs to ${A,}$ then ${x}$ also
		belongs to ${B.}$ If we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is
		<span class="underlineText">not</span> a subset of ${B,}$ we must find a
		single ${x}$ that belongs to ${A}$ but does not belong to ${B.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The definition above implies that the empty set is a subset of all sets, and
		a given set is a subset of itself. This follows directly from the
		definition. The proposition ${\varnothing \subseteq A}$ if, for all ${x \in
		\varnothing,}$ ${x \in A.}$ Because the sufficient condition, ${x \in
		\varnothing}$ is false, it follows that ${x \in A}$ is true. This is an
		example of a <span class="term">vacuous proof</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The case of ${A \subseteq A}$ straightforward. Given that ${A}$ and ${A}$
		are the same sets, every ${x \in A}$ implies that ${x \in A.}$ Because the
		sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is true, it follows
		that ${A \subseteq A}$ by definition.

		A subset is a general concept. When we say that ${A}$ is a
		&#8220;subset&#8221; of ${B,}$ we allow the possibility of ${A}$ and ${B}$
		being equal. For example, the set of all aardvarks is a subset of all
		Orycteropodidae, and the set of all Orycteropodidae is a subset of all
		Tubulidentata. However, aardvarks comprise all the members of
		Orycteropodidae, and Orycteropodidae comprise all the members of
		Tubulidentata. Thus, these sets are all equal, but are also subsets.

		>
		Now, if some extinct species of Orycteropodidae comes back to life or some
		new species is discovered, then the aardvarks would not comprise all of
		Orycteropodidae. In that situation, aardvarks are no longer
		<span class="italicsText">just</span> a subset of Orycteropodidae. We can
		still refer to aardvarks as a subset of Orycteropodidae, but we are now also

	<h2>The Empty Set</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			&#8220;All of my friends laugh at my jokes about vacuous truths.&#8221;
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Some sets have no members. For example, the set of all positive integers
		greater than their squares is the empty set. If there is even a single
		element in the set, then the set is not the empty set. Such a set (a set
		with a single member) is called a <span class="term">singleton</span>. Do
		not confuse the lack of an element with the lack of a subset. The empty set
		does have a subset &mdash; the empty set. But the fact that it has a subset
		does not imply that it has an element. We will see why this is the case
		shortly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The empty set is both an interesting and useful concept to have. Proferred
		by George Boole, the empty set embodies the concept of
		<span class="italicsText">nothingness</span>. Nothingness is a difficult
		concept to think about, but as with many things in mathematics, the idea is
		encapsulated &mdash; abstracted away &mdash; into a single symbol:
		${\varnothing.}$ The abstraction allows us to reason about nothingness
		differently. Usually, when we think of filling an empty pint with beer, we
		tend to think that we are somehow negating the glass's emptiness; sort of
		&#8220;removing&#8221; the nothingness inside the pint. ${\varnothing,}$
		however, is a member of every set except itself. We cannot remove
		nothingness from the set of all natural numbers &mdash; it's always there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Importantly, the empty set is a common source of mistakes among novices.
		First, we always denote the empty set with the null symbol: ${\varnothing.}$
		At no point do we ever write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\{ \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is equivalent to a spelling mistake in mathematics. Second, the set
		containing an empty set is <span class="underlineText">not</span> the same
		as the empty set:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\varnothing \neq \{ \varnothing \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Once more, these are two very different things. One is an actual object
		(${\varnothing}$), the other is a box containing a single object (${\{
		\varnothing \}}$). The empty set can be thought of as representing an empty
		folder. If we place an empty folder ${A}$ inside an empty folder ${B,}$ then
		the folder ${A}$ is no longer empty: It contains a folder. The distinction
		between elements and subsets is a critical distinction. Think of it this
		way: There's a meaningful difference between giving someone a beautifully
		wrapped present with nothing inside, and a beautifully wrapped present with
		something inside.
	</p>
	<section id="vacuous_truth">
		<h3>Vacuous Truth</h3>
		<p>
			The empty set offers an opportunity to revisit the notion of
			<span class="term">vacuous truth</span>. Here's the question: Suppose we
			had a set ${A.}$ Is the empty set a subset of ${A?}$ The tempting answer
			is &#8220;It depends. What's in ${A?}$&#8221; Unfortunately, the
			temptation is wrong &mdash; it does not depend. Recall the definition of a
			subset:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>
					${B \subseteq A \space}$ iff ${\space \forall x(x \in B \implies x \in
					A)}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The key point to consider is the condition ${x \in B.}$ Now substitute
			${B}$ with ${\varnothing.}$ Is the statement ${x \in \varnothing}$ true?
			Of course not. The empty set is empty &mdash; there's nothing in it. This
			means that the sufficient condition for the definition of a subset is
			always false when we consider the empty set as a subset. And what happens
			when a sufficient condition is false? The conditional proposition is
			always true! This is a vacuous truth: The empty set is a subset of ${A.}$
			In fact, the empty set is a subset of every set, including itself (since
			the condition is still false if we substitute ${A}$ with ${\varnothing}$).
		</p>
		<p>
			The notion of vacuous truth may seem strange, but it follows directly from
			logic. Consider the negation of the definition for a subset:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>
					${B \nsubseteq A \space}$ iff ${\space \exists x(x \in B \land x
					\notin A)}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			In other words, ${B}$ is not a subset of ${A}$ if there's an ${x}$ in
			${A}$ that's not in ${B.}$ We know there's nothing in the empty set, so
			there can never be an ${x}$ in ${B}$ that's not in ${A.}$ There are no
			${xs}$ to begin with.
		</p>
		<p>
			This discussion leads to some helpful points regarding proofs concerning
			sets:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				To prove that ${A \subseteq B,}$ show that ${A}$ and ${B}$ are just
				trenchcoats: If ${x}$ is inside ${A,}$ then ${x}$ is also inside ${B.}$
			</li>
			<li>
				To prove that ${A \nsubseteq B,}$ find a culprit: There's at least one
				${x}$ inside ${A}$ that's not inside ${B.}$
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If we think a little more carefully about the definition for subsets, we'd
			realize that this whole idea of the empty set being a subset of itself
			extends to a more general conclusion:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Theorem.</span> For every set ${S:}$</p>
				<ol>
					<li>${\varnothing \subseteq S}$ and</li>
					<li>${S \subseteq S}$</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Why is this true? Well, we know that since ${\varnothing}$ has no members,
			the sufficient condition for the definition of a subset is always false,
			so it follows that ${\varnothing \subseteq S}$ is always true. Next, by
			the law of identity, every statement implies itself. Thus, ${x \in S
			\implies x \in S.}$ This implies that every element of ${S}$ is an element
			of ${S.}$ And since every element of ${S}$ is an element of ${S,}$ it
			follows that ${S \subseteq S.}$

<section id="set_notation">
	<h2>Set Notation</h2>
	<p>
		To more efficiently discuss sets, mathematicians have come up with
		<span class="term">set notation</span>. Let's go over some of the most
		common notation.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose that ${S}$ is a set. The
				notation ${x \in S}$ means "${x}$ is an element of ${S}$."
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A set may be made more explicit through
		<span class="term">set roster notation</span>. For instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$
		is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If the set has too many
		elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example, the set of all integers
		from 0 to 100 may be written as: $\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise,
		the set of all positive integers may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can also specify sets in <span class="term">set builder notation</span>.
		Suppose that $S$ is a set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may
		or may not satisfy. We can define a new set that contains all the elements
		of $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \} }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
		refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
		some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
		"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				$$ \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{
				s.t. } P(x) \} $$

	<section id="intervals">
		<h3>Intervals</h3>
		<p>
			We might recall from calculus the need to define domains and ranges. For
			example, the function ${f(x) = \sin x}$ has a domain of ${\R,}$ and a
			range of ${-1 \leq f(x) \leq 1.}$ The range can alternatively be written
			as ${[1, -1].}$ Or, in <span class="italicsText">Bourbaki notation</span>,
			${]1,-1[.}$ This notation inherently represents a set:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${[-1, 1] = \{ f(x) : -1 \leq f(x) \leq b \}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Why a set? Because intervals are in fact sets. Formally:</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Definition.</span> An interval is a subset ${I}$
					of ${\R,}$ i.e., ${I \subset R,}$ such that:

					<div>

				</figure>
			</div>

		texts denote cardinality with ${\lvert A \rvert }$ and ${card(A).}$ We use
		${n(A)}$ because it is both concise and avoids any potential confusion with
		the use of ${\lvert \rvert }$ in classical algebra. Note that when analyzing
		cardinality, the axiom of extension applies. The set ${A = \{ 1, 1, 2 \}}$
		and ${B = \{ 1, 2 \}}$ are the same sets. Thus, both ${A}$ and ${B}$ have a
		cardinality of 2 (i.e., ${n(A) = n(B) = 2.}$)
	</p>
	<p>
		Another useful fact when handling cardinality: The empty set is the only set
		with a cardinality of 0:

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given a set ${A,}$ if ${n(A) =
				0,}$ then ${A}$ is the empty set, ${\varnothing.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Further note that because sets denote the number of elements in a set, for
		our purposes, we follow the axiom that cardinality can never be
		negative.<label for="negativeCardinality" class="margin-toggle"

		Because we explore set algebra, we are careful to state this axiom
		explicitly:

			More generally, we can compare the cardinalities of sets with the

		<h3>Countable Sets</h3>
		<p>
			Careful thought into sets reveals that there are some sets we can't count.
			For example, intuitively, we might think that because there are infinitely
			many integers, there are infinitely many odd positive integers, so we
			simply can't count all of the odd positive integers. This intuition,
			however, is wrong. Why? Because mathematics has a very strict definition
			of &#8220;countable&#8221;:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A set ${A}$ is
					<span class="italicsText">countable</span> iff:
				</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>(a) ${A}$ is finite; or</li>
					<li>(b) ${n(A) = n(\Z^{+})}$</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Otherwise, ${A}$ is <span class="italicsText">uncountable.</span>
					If ${A}$ is an infinite set and countable, we denote the cardinality
					of ${A}$ by writing ${n(A) = \alef_0,}$ and say that ${A}$ has
					cardinality &#8220;aleph null.&#8221;
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Based on this definition, we can see that the set of odd positive
			integers, ${\Z_{\text{odd}},}$ is a countable set. Why? Well consider the
			function ${f(n) = 2n - 1,}$ where ${n \in \Z^{+}.}$ This function maps the
			set of positive integers to the set of odd numbers. Now, recall the
			definition for when two sets are considered equal. They are equal iff
			there is a one-to-one correspondence between ${\Z^{+}}$ and
			${\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ Two sets have one-to-one correspondence if they are
			both (a) one-to-one and (b) onto.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first requirement, (a), is satisfied. Suppose that ${f(n) = f(m).}$
			From this assumption, it follows that ${2n - 1 = 2m - 1.}$ It then follows
			that ${n = m.}$ This proves that the set is onto.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second requirement, (b), is satisfied. Let's say there's some odd
			positive integer ${s.}$ Since ${s}$ is an odd positive integer, it is a
			positive integer of the form ${2k - 1,}$ where ${k \in \Z^{+}.}$ This in
			turn means that ${s}$ will always be less than an even positive integer
			${2k.}$ As such, it follows that ${s = 2k - 1 = f(k).}$ And given this
			fact, no ${s,}$ an odd positive integer, can map to even integer. It
			follows then that the odd positive integers will always map to the
			positive integers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Satisfying both (a) and (b), the function ${f}$ is a one-to-one
			correspondence from ${\Z^{+}}$ to ${\Z_{\text{odd}}.}$ And because it is
			of one-to-one correspondence, it follows that ${n(\Z_{\text{odd}}) =
			n(\Z^{+}).}$ This satisfies the definition of countability above &mdash;
			the set of odd positive integers is countable.

	<h2>Foundational Operations</h2>
	<p>
		Suppose there exists a set $A$. If an entity or discrete mathematical object
		$a$ belongs to $A$, we write ${a \in A}$ (read "$a$ is an element of $A$").
		If $a$ does not belong to $A$, we write ${a \notin A}$ (read "$a$ is not an
		element of $A$"). If the set $A$ has no elements, then it is the empty set
		${\varnothing}$, and we write ${A = \varnothing.}$

		Sets can be alluded to verbally, in set roster notation (where all its
		elements are individually listed), or in set notation (where the set is

	<ul>
		<li>
			"The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and

	<h4>Cardinality of Unions</h4>
	<p>
		Working with set theory, knowing the size of a union is tremendously useful.

		consists of all the elements in ${A,}$ ${B,}$ and the elements in both ${A}$
		and ${B,}$ the elements in both ${A}$ and ${B}$ are counted twice.
		Accordingly, we must subtract the intersection of ${A}$ and ${B}$ to
		retrieve the correct cardinality. This is called the
		<span class="term">principle of inclusion-exclusion</span>:

		<p>&#8220;Yes. That is a photo of the empty set.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Consider the set ${B = \{ 0, 1 \},}$ the set of binary digits. Using our

		The number 0 is the middle point of the number line, and because of that

	<p>
		The real number line is <span class="term">continuous</span> because it has
		no holes (i.e., areas where there is nothing). There are points all along

	<h2>Ordered Pairs</h2>
	<p>
		When set theory was first introduced, it faced a major issue &mdash; how do
		you represent ordered pairs? The axiom of extension renders order irrelevant
		for defining sets. For example, $\{ a, b \}$ is the same set as $\{ b, a
		\}$. This is problematic if we are referring specifically to "$a$ then b",
		rather than "$b$ then $a$."
	</p>
	<p>
		The patch was to define ordered pairs as sets. An ordered pair is a set of
		the form $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}$. The set has two elements: $\{ a \}$
		and $\{ a, b \}$. If $a \neq b$, then the two sets are distinct, and $a$ is
		in both sets but $b$ is not. With this definition, we can differentiate
		between $a$, and $b$. If $a = b$, then we can say that $a$ is both the first
		and second element of the pair.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, however, mathematicians learned that writing $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a,b
		\} \mid a = b \}$ was too cumbersome. So, the syntax was shortened: $(a,
		b)$.
	</p>
	<p>
		Formalizing the discussion above: Let $a$ and $b$ be elements. The notation
		$(a, b)$ means the <span class="term">ordered pair</span> consisting of $a$
		and $b$ together, such that $a$ is the first element of the pair and $b$ is
		the second element.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equality of Ordered Pairs.</span> Suppose $(a, b)$ and
		$(c, d)$ are ordered pairs. The ordered pairs are equal if, and only if, $a
		= c$ and $b = d$. Thus, the statement $(a, b) = (c, d)$ implies that $a = c$
		and $b = d$.

	<h2>Tuples</h2>

		<p>
			While $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} $, let $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ be
			elements. An $n$-tuple consists of $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$, ordered as:

		Ordered pairs are more generally called <span class="term">tuples</span>,
		specifically 2-tuples. In mathematics, a tuple is a finite list of
		<span class="underlineText">ordered</span> elements. An
		<span class="term">${n-}$tuple</span> is a sequence of ${n}$ elements, where
		$n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ (a non-negative integer). An
		<span class="term">ordered 2-tuple</span> is an
		<span class="italicsText">ordered pair</span>. An
		<span class="term">ordered 3-tuple</span> is an
		<span class="italicsText">ordered triple,</span> and so on and so forth.

		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition: Equality of Tuples.</span> Let A be the
				ordered $n$-tuple $(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots x_n)$, and B the ordered

	<p>
		Tuples allow us to conclude that an object has the same properties as
		another. For example:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>Jane = ${(female, 27, Wisconsin)}$</p>
			<p>Alice = ${(female, 27, Wisconsin)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The elements in the tuples above are said to be equal. We say that tuples
		are equal if, and only if, every element in the tuple is the same as the
		element with the same position in the other tuple(s).

		Many objects have multiple properties. For example, a deck of cards can be
		described as a set of 52 cards. Each card has a property in common with all
		other cards &mdash; a face value. That face value itself has two properties
		&mdash; (A) a suit, and (B) a rank. We can denote these sets as such:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>
				$A$ = { &spades;, <span class="redText">&hearts;</span>, &clubs;,
				<span class="redText">&diams;</span> }

			<p>$B$ = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A }</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Every card in the deck can be represented as an ordered pair of 1 element

		Symbolically, $A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n = \{ (a_1, a_2,
		\ldots , a_n) \mid a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, \ldots , a_n \in A_n \}$
		Particularly, $A_1 \times A_2 = \{ (a_1, a_2) \mid a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2
		\}$ is the Cartesian product of $A_1$ and $A_2$.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example: Let ${A = \{ x, y \}}$, ${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$, and ${C = \{ a,
		b \}.}$ ${A \times B}$ is:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

		<div>
			<p>${B \times A = \{ (1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y), (3,x), (3,y) \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		${A \times A}$ is a special case with its own notation. This is the
		Cartesian product of a set and the set itself, so we denote it with ${A^2.}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${A^2 = \{ (x, x), (x, y), (y, x), (y, y) \}}$</p>

		Because Cartesian products are more generally sets, they have cardinality:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(A \times B) = 6}$</p>
			<p>${n(B \times A) = 6}$</p>
			<p>${n(A \times A) = 4}$</p>
			<p>${n((A \times B) \times C) = 12}$</p>

	</figure>
	<p>
		The Cartesian products ${A \times B,}$ ${B \times A,}$ and ${(A \times B)
		\times A}$ are more generally called <span class="term">relations</span>. We
		will revisit relations in more detail later, but for now, know that the
		Cartesian product ${A \times B}$ is said to be a
		<span class="italicsText">relation</span> from the set ${A}$ to the set
		${B.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Cartesian products are a bridge between discrete mathematics and continuous
		mathematics. $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is the Cartesian product &mdash;
		the set of all ordered pairs &mdash; $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are
		real numbers. If we assign every $x$ to a point on a line and every $y$ to a
		point on another line perpendicular to $x$'s line, the lines form a plane.
		That plane is called the
		<span class="term">Cartesian plane</span>, and every ordered pair $(x, y)$
		lies on it.

		As we can likely gather, Cartesian products are useful for laying out the
