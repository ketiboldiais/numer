<h1>Set Theory</h1>
<section id="set_theory" class="grid-item">
	<p>
		In mathematics, a <span class="boldText">set</span> is a collection of
		objects. Those objects might be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values,
		variables, or more abstractly, propositions. For example, the set of all
		coins includes nickels, sterling, and yen. The set of all countries includes
		Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We
		can visualize a set as:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/set_intro.svg' %}"
			alt="simple set"
			class="fifty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
		are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
		<span class="term">member</span> of that set.
	</p>
	<p>
		We say that a set is <span class="term">well-defined</span> if, for any
		given ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of the set. For
		example, the set ${L = \{x \in \R \mid x > 4\}}$ is a well-defined set.
		Given any ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of ${L.}$ ${x}$
		must be a real number, and it must be greater than 4. The set ${G = \{ 1, 4,
		3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set. Is ${3.2}$ a
		member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a determination.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic">The Axiom of Extension</h2>
	<p>
		The
		<span class="term">axiom of extension</span> provides that a set is
		completely determined by what its elements are &mdash; it is irrelevant
		whether the elements are in order, or whether an element is listed more than
		once.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$,
		and the same set as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic">Subsets</h2>
	<p>
		Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called
		<span class="term">subsets</span>. For example, the set of all Herefords is
		a subset of the set of all cows, and the set of all bonobos is a subset of
		the set of all great apes. More formally:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. The
				set $A$ is a <span class="italicsText">subset</span> of $B$ if, and only
				if, <span class="underlineText">every</span> element of $A$ is also an
				element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ A \subseteq B }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x}$, if
		${x \in A}$, then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$ relationship
		with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$ contains
		${A.}$"
	</p>
	<p>If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ A \nsubseteq B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one
		element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is
		not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not
		an element of B.
	</p>
	<h3>Proper Subsets</h3>
	<p>
		A subset is a general concept. When we say that ${A}$ is a
		&#8220;subset&#8221; of ${B,}$ we allow the possibility of ${A}$ and ${B}$
		being equal. For example, the set of all aardvarks is a subset of all
		Orycteropodidae, and the set of all Orycteropodidae is a subset of all
		Tubulidentata. However, aardvarks comprise all the members of
		Orycteropodidae, and Orycteropodidae comprise all the members of
		Tubulidentata. Thus, these sets are all equal, but are also subsets.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>In biology, a taxon (an instance of a taxonomy level, e.g., kingdom,
			phylum, class, etc.) with only one superset is called
			<span class="term">monotypic</span>. Aardvarks, the Albany pitcher plant,
			the hyacinth macaw, among others are all monotypic.</span
		>
		Now, if some extinct species of Orycteropodidae comes back to life or some
		new species is discovered, then the aardvarks would not comprise all of
		Orycteropodidae. In that situation, aardvarks are no longer
		<span class="italicsText">just</span> a subset of Orycteropodidae. We can
		still refer to aardvarks as a subset of Orycteropodidae, but we are now also
		permitted to more specifically say that aardvarks are a
		<span class="term">proper subset</span> of Orycteropodidae.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets.
				${A}$ is a <span class="term">proper subset</span> of ${B}$ if, and only
				if, every element of ${A}$ is in ${B,}$ but there is at least one
				element in $B$ that is not in $A$. If $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, we
				write:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ A \subset B }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If ${A \subset B}$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of ${A}$ are
		elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of ${B}$ that is not an
		element of ${A.}$ We can also infer that all the elements of ${A}$ have some
		property in common that separate it from other subsets of ${B.}$
		<span class="marginnote"
			>A helpful way to distinguish between the two symbols is noticing how they
			share similarities to the symbols ${\leq}$ and ${<.}$ ${\subseteq }$ means
			"subset or equal" and ${\subset}$ means "subset but not equal;" the former
			is more general than the latter.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we
		write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ A \not\subset B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or $A
		\subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$.
	</p>
	<h3>The Empty Set</h3>
	<p>
		Some sets have no members. For example, the set of all living humans over a
		thousand years old is the empty set, because it contains no members (at
		least to the author's knowledge). By convention in mathematics, the null set
		${\emptyset}$ is a subset of every set, and is a proper subset of every set
		except itself (since the null set has no members).
	</p>
	<p>
		The empty set is both an interesting and useful concept to have. Proferred
		by George Boole, the empty set embodies the concept of
		<span class="italicsText">nothingness</span>. Nothingness is a difficult
		concept to think about, but as with many things in mathematics, the idea is
		encapsulated &mdash; abstracted away &mdash; into a single symbol:
		${\emptyset.}$ The abstraction allows us to reason about nothingness
		differently. Usually, when we think of filling an empty pint with beer, we
		tend to think that we are somehow negating the glass's emptiness; sort of
		&#8220;removing&#8221; the nothingness inside the pint. ${\emptyset,}$
		however, is a member of every set except itself. We cannot remove
		nothingness from the set of all natural numbers &mdash; it's always there.
	</p>
	<h3>Set Notation</h3>
	<p>
		To more efficiently discuss sets, mathematicians have come up with
		<span class="term">set notation</span>. Let's go over some of the most
		common notation.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose that ${S}$ is a set. The
				notation ${x \in S}$ means "${x}$ is an element of ${S}$."
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A set may be made more explicit through
		<span class="term">set roster notation</span>. For instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$
		is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If the set has too many
		elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example, the set of all integers
		from 0 to 100 may be written as: $\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise,
		the set of all positive integers may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can also specify sets in <span class="term">set builder notation</span>.
		Suppose that $S$ is a set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may
		or may not satisfy. We can define a new set that contains all the elements
		of $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \} }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
		refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
		some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
		"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				$$ \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{
				s.t. } P(x) \} $$
			</p>
		</div>

		</div>

		set of all elements of both $A$ and $B$. Visually:

	<h3 class="topic">Set Intersection</h3>
	<p>
		Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the

		is the set of all elements in both $A$ and $B$. Visually:

		Let $A$ and $B$ both be sets. The difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A

	<h3>Cardinality</h3>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\{ a, b, c, d \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		How many elements are in this set? There are 4. The number of elements in a
		set is called the set's <span class="term">cardinality</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given a set ${A,}$ the notation:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">

				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>denotes the <span class="italicsText">cardinality</span> of ${A.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The notation ${n(A)}$ is not the only one way to denote cardinality. Some
		texts denote cardinality with ${\lvert A \rvert }$ and ${card(A).}$ We use
		${n(A)}$ because it is both concise and avoids any potential confusion with
		the use of ${\lvert \rvert }$ in classical algebra. Note that when analyzing
		cardinality, the axiom of extension applies. The set ${A = \{ 1, 1, 2 \}}$
		and ${B = \{ 1, 2 \}}$ are the same sets. Thus, both ${A}$ and ${B}$ have a
		cardinality of 2 (i.e., ${n(A) = n(B) = 2.}$)
	</p>
	<p>
		Another useful fact when handling cardinality: The empty set is the only set
		with a cardinality of 0. Thus, we have the following proposition:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given a set ${A,}$ if ${n(A) =
				0,}$ then ${A}$ is the empty set, ${\emptyset.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Further note that because sets denote the number of elements in a set, for
		our purposes, we follow the axiom that cardinality can never be negative.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>Negative cardinality is a concept explored in modern mathematics, but it
			is beyond the scope of these materials.</span
		>
		Because we explore set algebra, we are careful to state this axiom
		explicitly:

		The number 0 is the middle point of the number line, and because of that

		The real number line is <span class="boldText">continuous</span> because it

		Some of the numbers are separated from one another at specific, constant
