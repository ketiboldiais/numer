	<h4>Invariants</h4>
	<p>
		Great proofs have several characteristics: (1) correct; (2) comlete; (3)
		clear; (4) brief &mdash; crisp and concise, not an overload of details; (5)
		well-organized &mdash; modular, in that its pieces or discretely separated,
		i.e., using lemmas; (6) well-ordered &mdash; flowing from one premise to the
		next; (7) elegant &mdash; very clever. Great proofs are very much like
		well-written source code.
	</p>

	<p>
		Consider a puzzle. We want to move the tiles below such that they are in
		alphabetical order. We can only move up, down, left, or right, and we cannot
		take the tiles of the grid:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/alphabet_tile.svg' %}"

			loading="lazy"
			class="fifty-p"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>Here is the proposition:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				There is no sequence of legal moves to invert ${g}$ and ${h}$ and return
				all other letters to their original position.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		To prove this proposition, we must use an
		<span class="term">invariant</span>. To show that a system can never reach a
		particular special state, we can do so by showing that there is some
		property called the invariant that holds at the initial state, is preserved
		at every legal move, and does not exist at the special state. In other
		words, if we have a property that exists at the initial state, and holds at
		every successive state, then the only state we can ever reach is a state
		that has that property, the invariant. Thus, if the special state has that
		property, we can never reach it.
	</p>

	<p>
		To figure out the invariant, we have to think about what happens at each
		move in the system. Let's first consider the row-move. We can move a tile to
		the left or right, and everything else stays the same. In other words, the
		relative order, or the <span class="term">natural order</span> of the tiles,
		is left unchanged. For example, if we moved ${g}$ in the diagram above, the
		relative order remains the same: ${a-b-c,}$ ${d-e-f,}$ and ${h-g.}$ We
		should state this as a lemma:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> A row move does not change the order
				of the letters.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>And we should prove this lemma:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Proof.</span> In a row move, we move an item from
				some cell ${i}$ to an adjacent cell ${i+1}$ or ${i-1.}$ Because nothing
				else moves, the order of the items is preserved.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Second, let's consider the column-move. We can move a tile up or down. This
		changes the natural order. For example, if we moved ${f}$ in the diagram
		above, the relative order has changed &mdash; ${f}$ used to be after ${d}$
		and ${e,}$ but now it is after ${h}$ and ${g.}$
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/colum_move.svg' %}"
			alt="column move"
			loading="lazy"
			class="ninety-p"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		From these two possible column moves, we can determine that a column move
		changes either (a) the previous two tiles, or (b) the next two tiles. This
		means the relative orders of two pairs changes. Let's state this as a lemma:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> A column move changes the relative
				order of precisely two pairs of items.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>We should prove this:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Proof.</span> In a column move, we move an item in
				cell ${i}$ to a blank spot in cell ${i - 3}$ or ${i + 3.}$ And when an
				item moves three positions, it changes relative order with two other
				items, either cell ${i - 1,}$ ${i - 2,}$ ${i + 1,}$ or ${i + 2.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		With these two lemmas, we've exhausted the moves. What can we infer from
		these lemmas? In a row move, nothing changes. In a column move, two pairs
		change. So what is the invariant? What is something that will not change?
		Suppose we have an even number of tiles out order to begin with. Now we know
		our only option is to use column moves, since row moves do not change any
		relative order. But with column moves, we can only change two tiles at most.
		And if we can only change two tiles at most, then we can we will always have
		an even number of tiles out of order. More formally:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A pair of letters, ${L_1}$ and
				${L_2,}$ form an <span class="italicsText">inversion</span>, or an
				<span class="italicsText">inverted pair</span>, if ${L_1}$ precedes
				${L_2}$ in the alphabet and ${L_1}$ appears after ${L_2}$ in the grid.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The above definition defines an <span class="term">inverted pair</span>. For
		example, consider the following configuration:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/inverted_pair.svg' %}"
			alt="inversion"
			loading="lazy"
			class="sixty-p"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Here, there are three inversions; ${(d, f), (e, f), (e, g).}$ Like the case
		where we have an even number of out-of-order tiles, if we have an odd
		number, no matter how many column moves we perform, there will always be an
		odd number of out-or-order tiles. Knowing this, if we start with one tile
		out-of-order, then we will always have an odd number of tiles out of order,
		because 1 is an odd number. We can state another lemma:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> During a move, the number of
				inversions can only increase by 2, decrease by 2 or stay the same.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>The proof for this lemma is a simple case-exhaustion.</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Proof.</span> In a row move, there are no changes in
				the number of inversions, following the first lemma. In a column move,
				two pairs change order, by the second lemma. There are three cases of
				how the pairs were arranged before the column move: (a) Both pairs were
				in order. (b) Both pairs were inverted. (c) One pair was inverted, the
				other was not.
			</p>
			<p>
				In case (a), the number of inverted pairs goes up by 2. In case (b), the
				number of inverted pairs goes down by 2. In case (c), the number of
				inverted pairs stays the same.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Following the second lemma, we have a corollary:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Corollary.</span> During a move, the parity of the
				number of inverted pairs stays the same.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The proof for this corollary is founded from an axiom in number theory:
		Adding 2 or subtracting 2 from an even or odd number does not change its
		parity. The corollary we just drew is what cracks this problem. In the
		original problem, we start with 1 tile out-of-order. Thus, at the beginning
		of the problem, the parity of the number of inversions is 1. Following
		corollary 2, the parity of the number of inversions will always be odd:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> In every state reachable from the
				start state, the parity of the number inversions is odd.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The proof of this lemma is by induction. In fact, invariant proofs are
		always by induction. The inductive hypothesis here is ${P(n):}$ "After any
		sequence of ${n}$ moves from the start state, the parity of the number of
		inversions is odd."
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Proof.</span> In the base case ${P(0),}$ there is
				exactly one inversion. Thus, the base case is true. Now we consider the
				inductive case. Here, we want to show that for any ${n \geq 0,}$ ${P(n)
				\implies P(n + 1).}$ Consider any sequence of ${n+1}$ moves: ${m_1, m_2,
				\ldots, m_{n+1}.}$
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of ${P(n),}$ we know that after ${n}$ moves, the parity is still
				odd. By the first corollary, during any move, the parity of the number
				of inversions does not change during ${m_{n+1}.}$ Therefore, the parity
				of the number of inversions after all ${n+1}$ moves is odd. Hence,
				${P(n+1)}$ is true. Ergo, ${P(n) \implies P(n+1)}$ is true.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Now we can prove the theorem:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Proof.</span> The parity of the number inversions in
				the desired state is ${0}$ &mdash; even. By the fourth lemma, the
				desired state cannot be reached using legal moves from the start state,
				because the start state's parity is odd.
