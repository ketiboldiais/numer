<h1>Algorithmic Analysis</h1>
<section id="introduction">
	<p>
		In discrete mathematics &mdash; and computer science &mdash; many problems
		are best solved by first constructing a
		<span class="italicsText">model</span>: translate the problem into
		mathematical terms. For example, to find a fleeing murder suspect, we might
		place all their possible hiding places into a set. We might then arrange the
		hiding places into a graph, where each hiding place is a node. Each of those
		nodes likely have varying distances between them, so we might construct a
		function computing each node's likelihood of containing the suspect. That
		function might take numerous inputs, ranging from the distance between the
		nodes to sightings made by various eyewitnesses. Based on the function's
		outputs, we might abstract the nodes into an array, sorted from most likely
		to least likely to contain the suspect.
	</p>
	<p>
		Discrete mathematics provides a war chest of various structures we can use
		for modelling: sets, classes, algebras, sequences, matrices, functions,
		permutations, relations, graphs, trees, networks, finite state machines,
		truth tables, and countless others.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>Our problem solving abilities are further expanded with tools from
			continuous mathematics.</span
		>
		However, knowing <span class="italicsText">what</span> the tools do is
		insufficient. We can buy expensive knives and cutting-edge kitchen
		appliances, but they do not make us Michellin-star chefs. Just as with any
		skilled craft, the tools are only useful if we know
		<span class="italicsText">how to</span> use them. That
		<span class="italicsText">how-to</span> knowledge is provided by an
		<span class="term">algorithm</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> An algorithm is a finite sequence
				of instructions for performing a computation.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To study algorithms from a discrete mathematics perspective, we will employ
		pseudocode. For those familiar with at least one programming language, the
		pseudocode that follows should be straightforward and immediately readable.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>For those without a programming knowledge background, this author
			recommends an introductory course on Python. Two reasons: (1) It is a
			fairly &mdash; almost deceptively &mdash; beginner-friendly language. (2)
			When writing the pseudocode for these materials, some of the code looked
			an awful lot like Python.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>For example, consider this problem:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Problem.</span> Given a finite sequence of integers,
				find the maximum value.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In constructing an algorithm, we must always think in terms of a computer. A
		computer cannot see all the values in a structure all at once, whether that
		structure is a sequence, graph, tree, etc. Instead, the computer can only
		&#8220;see&#8221; one value at a time. We can think of it like standing
		right in front of an opening at the airport's baggage claim area. Standing
		just in front of the opening, we can only see one bag come out at a time. We
		cannot see all the bags coming before it. The same idea goes for computers
		&mdash; the computer can only see one value at a time.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that in mind, we can elaborate on a potential algorithm as such: (1)
		Suppose the first integer in the sequence is the maximum; call it ${max.}$
		(2) Compare ${max}$ to the next integer in the sequence: If the integer is
		greater than ${max,}$ then suppose ${max}$ is that integer. Otherwise,
		compare the next integer. (3) Repeat the previous steps until all the
		integers in the sequence have been compared. (4) If all the integers in the
		seuqence have been compared, then the maximum is ${max.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Those are a lot of words for a relatively simple computation. While its
		expressiveness in poetry and literature is immeasurable, English is a
		painful and severely limited language for expressing complex and abstract
		ideas, while maintaining precision (hence the human tendency to develop
		notation systems, as seen in symbolic logic, mathematics, and the sciences).
		Because of this limitation, let's write the algorithm in pseudocode:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="syntax">
			<ul>
				<li>${\ell \coloneqq [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] : n \in \Z}$</li>
				<li>${\text{max}(\ell)}$</li>
				<ul>
					<li>${\text{max} \coloneqq a_1}$</li>
					<li>for ${i \coloneqq 2}$ to ${n}$:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>${\text{max} < a_i \implies \text{max} \coloneqq a_i}$</li>
					</ul>
					<li>return ${\text{max}}$</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The algorithm above works. This is a good point for further refining our
		definition of an algorithm. We can think of an algorithm as a sequence of
		instructions towards solving a problem. However, with that definition,
		numerous procedures would qualify as algorithms: the banana bread recipe;
		the YouTube video on changing a tire; counsel's instructions on how to avoid
		a congressional hearing; counsel's instructions on how to testify at a
		congressional hearing. While the WikiHow article falls under the definition
		of an algorithm, it is likely not the kind of algorithm we are concerned
		with. Instead, the algorithms we study are those with the following
		properties:
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<div>
			<p>
				<span class="term">Domain.</span> Every algorithm takes an element,
				called an <span class="italicsText">input</span>, from its domain
				&mdash; the set of all possible values the algorithm may take from.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="term">Range.</span> For every input an algorithm takes, the
				algorithm returns an element, called the
				<span class="italicsText">output</span>, from its range &mdash; the set
				of all possible values the algorithm may return. The algorithm's outputs
				are a subset of the range. This subset is called the algorithm's
				<span class="term">solution</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="term">Definiteness.</span> An algorithm is definite if, and
				only if, all of its operation, or steps, are defined precisely.

			<p>
				<span class="term">Correctness.</span> An algorithm is correct if, and

		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<span class="term">Finiteness.</span> An algorithm is finite if, and

<section id="searching">
	<h2>Search</h2>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">search</span> is an algorithm for locating a given
		element in a list. That list may be
		<span class="italicsText">ordered</span> &mdash; i.e., a sequence &mdash; or
		it may be <span class="italicsText">unordered</span>. For the algorithms
		that follow, we will assume the list is ordered. A more explicit, and
		general, definition of the searching problem:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Problem.</span> Given the list ${[a_0, a_1, \ldots ,
				a_n],}$ locate the element ${x}$ if it exists.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The solution to a searching problem is the location of the element that
		equals ${x.}$ I.e. ${i}$ is the solution iff ${a_i = x.}$ Otherwise, the
		solution is ${\emptyset.}$
	</p>
</section>

<section id="linear_search">
	<h3>Linear Search</h3>
	<p>
		The simplest searching algorithm is
		<span class="italicsText">linear search</span>. Linear search works as such:
		First, compare ${x}$ and ${a_0,}$ the first element in the list. If ${x =
		a_0,}$ then the solution is 0, the location of ${a_0.}$ If ${x \neq a_0,}$
		compare ${x}$ with ${a_1.}$ If ${x = a_1,}$ then the solution is 1, the
		position of ${a_1.}$ Otherwise, compare ${x}$ with ${a_2.}$ We continue this
		process until either (a) a match is found, or (b) we have gone through the
		entire list.
	</p>
	<p>In pseudocode:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="syntax">
			<ul>
				<li>${\ell \coloneqq [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]}$</li>
				<li>${x \coloneqq \text{ search term}, x \in \Z}$</li>
				<li>linear-search(${x, \ell}$):</li>
				<ul>
					<li>${i \coloneqq 1}$</li>
					<li>while (${i \leq n}$):</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							${ \begin{cases} \text{if } (a_i = x) &\implies &\text{ location}
							\coloneqq i \\ \text{else } &\implies &\text{ location} \coloneqq
							0 \end{cases} }$
						</li>
						<li>${i \coloneqq i + 1}$</li>
					</ul>
					<li>return ${\text{location}}$</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="binary_search">
	<h3>Binary Search</h3>
	<p>
		Another searching algorithm we could use is
		<span class="term">binary search</span>. Binary search works much like how
		we would look for a word in a dictionary. To begin, the list's elements must
		be ordered from least to greatest. Only then can we perform the search.
	</p>
	<p>
		Assuming the elements are ordered, we begin: Suppose our search term is
		${x,}$ and our list contains ${n}$ elements. First, locate the list's middle
		element, ${a_{m},}$ where ${m = \lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor.}$ If ${x =
		a_{m}}$ then our search is complete. Otherwise, if ${x \neq a_{m},}$ then we
		split the list in half. This results in two new lists, ${[a_1, \ldots,
		a_{m}]}$ and ${[a_{m + 1}, \ldots, a_n].}$ If ${a_{m} < x,}$ then we examine
		the second-half of the list ${[a_{m + 1}, \ldots, a_n].}$ If ${a_{m} > x,}$
		then we examine the first-half of the list ${[a_1, \ldots, a_{n/2}].}$
		Examining that list, we perform the same procedure: Locate the middle
		element; compare; split. We keep repeating this until we either (1) find a
		match, or (2) have no more lists to split. Consider the diagram below:
	</p>
	<p>In pseudocode:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="syntax">
			<ul>
				<li>
					${\ell \coloneqq [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] : a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n}$
				</li>
				<li>${x \coloneqq \text{search term} }$</li>
				<li>${i \coloneqq 1}$</li>
				<li>${j \coloneqq n}$</li>
				<li>linear-search(${x, \ell}$)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>while ${i < j}$:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>${m \coloneqq \lfloor \frac{i + j}{2} \rfloor }$</li>
						<li>
							${ \begin{cases} \text{if } (x > a_m) &\implies &i \coloneqq m + 1
							\\ \text{else } &\implies &j \coloneqq m \end{cases} }$
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						${ \begin{cases} \text{if } (x = a_i) &\implies &\text{ location}
						\coloneqq i \\ \text{else } &\implies &\text{ location} \coloneqq 0
						\end{cases} }$
					</li>
					<li>return ${location}$</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>

<section id="sorting">
	<h2>Sorting</h2>
	<p>
		The previous algorithms &mdash; and many other algorithms &mdash; depend on
		ordered inputs. In other words, the algorithms only work under the
		assumption that its set of inputs are
		<span class="italicsText">sorted</span>. Sorting a list of elements requires
		transforming an unordered list into a list where the elements are ordered
		from least to greatest. The problem of sorting elements creates an entirely
		separate class of algorithms: <span class="term">sorting algorithms</span>.
		More explicitly: The sorting algorithm's purpose is to take an unordered
		list, say ${[ 1, 3, 2, 4],}$ and output an ordered list, ${[1, 2, 3, 4].}$
