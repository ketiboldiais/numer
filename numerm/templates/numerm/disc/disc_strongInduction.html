<h1>Strong Induction</h1>
<section id="strong_induction">
	<p>
		Another kind of proof-by-induction is the
		<span class="term">proof-by-strong-induction</span>. This is a proof
		structured according to the
		<span class="italicsText">axiom of strong induction</span>:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>Axiom: Strong Induction.</small>
		<p>
			Let ${P(n)}$ be any predicate. If ${P(n)}$ is true, if ${P(0) \land
			P(1) \land P(2) \land \ldots \land P(n)}$ are all true, then
			${P(n+1).}$ More formally:
		</p>
		$$P(0) \land P(1) \land \ldots \land P(n) \implies P(n+1)$$
	</dfn>

	<p>
		The only difference between ordinary induction and strong induction is
		that with ordinary induction, we are attempting to prove that ${P(n)
		\implies P(n+1).}$ In strong induction, we are trying to prove that
		${P(0) \land \ldots \land P(n) \implies P(n+1).}$ However, he technique
		is no different. We are still trying to prove an implication, so we
		assume that ${P(n)}$ is true, ${P(n-1)}$ is true, ${P(n-2)}$ is true,
		all the way to ${P(0).}$ It is called strong induction because we are
		allowed to assume much more that just ${P(n).}$ If we look closely, we
		wonder if a proof-by-induction can be done with a
		proof-by-strong-induction. This is in fact the case. Any
		proof-by-induction can be rewritten as a proof-by-strong induction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fair question: Why not use proof-by-strong-induction all the time then?
		Because some problems are much easier to solve with an ordinary
		proof-by-induction rather than with a proof-by-strong-induction.
	</p>
	<p>
		To explore how a proof-by-strong-induction looks like, we consider
		another game, <span class="italicsText">stack split</span>. We start
		with a stack of 8 blocks. In the first move, the player must divide the
		stack into 2 substacks. If the player divides the stack into 3 and 5,
		the player receives 15 points: ${3 \times 5.}$ In the next move, the
		player divides either substack into 2 substacks. For example, if the
		player divides the stack of 5 into 4 and 1, the player receives 4
		points. The player must keep dividing the substacks until they have 8
		stacks of height 1. The last move is dividing a 2-block substack into 2
		substacks of 1 block, returning the player 1 point. The player's total
		score is the sum of all points received on each move. The goal: Obtain
		the most number of points.

	</figure>
	<p>
		It turns out that no matter how we divide the stacks, the final score
		will always be 28. Let's state the proposition:
	</p>
	<dfn>
		<small>conjecture</small>
		<p>
			All strategies for the ${n}$ block game produce the same score,
			${S(n).}$
		</p>
	</dfn>

	<p>
		Following this conjecture, we saw that ${S(8) = 28.}$ So, let's begin
		the proof. First, we state the inductive hypothesis: ${P(n) \coloneqq}$
		"All strategies produce the same score ${S(n).}$" Second, we verify
		that the base case is correct. At ${n = 1,}$ the score is 0, since we
		never made a move. Thus, ${S(1) = 0.}$ Now we make the inductive step:
		Assume ${P(1) \land P(2) \land \ldots \land P(n)}$ is true to prove
		${P(n+1).}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, given ${n+1}$ blocks, we can split the stack in a stack of ${k}$
		blocks or a stack of ${(n + 1)-k}$ blocks, where ${1 \leq k \leq n}$:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/stackgame1.svg' %}"
			alt="stack"
			loading="lazy"
			width="150px"
			height="70px"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The resulting score is ${k(n+1-k).}$ If we split the block of ${k}$
		blocks, then we have ${P(k)}$ points.Thus, the resulting score from
		spliting ${k}$ blocks is ${k(n+1-k)+P(k).}$ And if we split the
		${(n+1)-k}$ stack, we get ${P(n+1-k).}$ Thus, our total score for the
		game is:
	</p>

	<figure>$$k(n+1-k) + P(k) + P(n+1-k)$$</figure>

	<p>
		Recall what are trying to prove: The total score just depends on ${n,}$
		not ${k.}$ In other words:
	</p>

	$$S(n+1) = k(n+1-k) + P(k) + P(n+1-k)$$

	<p>
		It seems like we're stuck. In every term, there is a ${k.}$ Whenever
		we're stuck with inductive proof like this, we want to make a stronger
		inductive hypothesis. To make the hypothesis stronger, we want
		represent ${S(n)}$ as a formula. This appears to be summing a pattern
		of numbers, and those numbers are formed by divisions. But, the formula
		should work for every possible way we could divide. The simplest way to
		divide would be to just take one stack off at a time, 1 and 7, 1 and 6,
		1 and 5, 1 and 4, 1 and 3, 1 and 2, 1 and 1. The resulting score is the
		sum of ${1 \times 7,}$ ${1 \times 6,}$ and so on. More generally, given
		${n}$ numbers in order, this just the sum of ${n-1}$ numbers:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Checking this formula against the base case, it works: ${S(1) =
		(1(1-1))/2 = 0.}$ So, let's try it on our total score thus far:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<p>
			${S(n + 1) = k(n + 1 - k) + \dfrac{k(k - 1)}{2} + \dfrac{(n + 1 -
			k)(n - k)}{2}}$
		</p>
		<p>
			${\phantom{S(n + 1)} = \dfrac{2k(n + 1 - k) + k(k - 1) + (n + 1 -
			k)(n - k)}{2}}$
		</p>
		<p>
			${\phantom{S(n + 1)} = \dfrac{2kn + 2k - 2k^2 + k^2 - k + n^2 + n -
			kn - kn - k + k^2}{2}}$
		</p>
		<p>${\phantom{S(n + 1)} = \dfrac{n^2 + n}{2}}$</p>
		<p>${\phantom{S(n + 1)} = \dfrac{n(n + 1)}{2}}$</p>
	</figure>

	<p>
		It's better than magic. The formula for ${S(n + 1)}$ is
		${\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}.}$ This establishes the stronger hypothesis,
		thereby proving that all strategies for an ${n-block}$ game result in
		the same score, ${\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}.}$
