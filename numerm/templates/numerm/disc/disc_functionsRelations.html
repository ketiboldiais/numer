	<h3>Functions &amp; Relations</h3>
	<p>
		Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. A function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a
		<span class="italicsText">relation</span> with domain $A$ and a codomain
		$B$, such that the following properties are true:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			For every ${x \in A,}$ there is a ${y \in B}$ such that ${(x,y) \in f.}$
		</li>
		<li>For all ${x \in A,}$ ${y \in B,}$ and ${z \in B,}$</li>
		<ul>
			<li>if ${(x,y) \in F}$ and ${(x,z) \in f,}$ then ${y = z.}$</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<p>
		In other words, the relation $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a function if, and only
		if:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Every element of $A$ is the first element of an ordered pair of $f$, and
		</li>
		<li>No two distinct ordered pairs in $f$ have the same first element.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		If $A$ and $B$ are sets and $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, then given
		any element ${x \in A,}$ the unique element in $B$ that is related to $x$ by
		$f$ is denoted ${f(x)}$, read "$f$ of $x$"

	<h4>Functions &amp; Relations on Strings</h4>
	<p>
		Suppose ${A = \{ a,b \},}$ and let $S$ be the set of all strings over $A$.
		Now consider a relation $C$ from $S$ to $S$, defined as follows: For all
		strings $s$ and $t$ in $S$, ${(s,t) \in C \implies t = as,}$ where ${as}$ is
		the string obtained by appending $a$ on the left of the characters in $s$.
		Given this definition, we say that $C$ is a
		<span class="boldText">concatenation</span> by $a$ on the left.

<section id="functions_formula_defined" class="grid-item">
	<h4>Functions Defined by Formulas</h4>
	<p>
		We often define functions in mathematics with formulas. For example, the
		<span class="boldText">squaring function</span> $f$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to
		$\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the formula ${f(x) = x^2}$ for every ${x \in
		\mathbb{R}.}$ Whatever real number is substituted for $x$, the output of $f$
		will be the square of that number (${f: x \mapsto x^2.}$)
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise, the <span class="boldText">successor function</span> $g$ from
		$\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by the formula ${g(n) = n + 1.}$
		Thus, whatever integer is substituted for $n$, the output of $g$ is the
		number plus 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		While functions are often defined by formulas, we should remember that they
		are just relations, which are in turn just subsets of a Cartesian product.
		Thus, if $f$ and $g$ ad functions from a set $A$ to a set $B$, then:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${f = \{ (x,y) \in A \times B \mid y = f(x) \}}$</li>
		<li>${g = \{ (x,y) \in A \times B \mid y = g(x) \}}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Given this fact, it follows that: ${f = g \iff f(x) = g(x) \text{ for all }
		x \in A.}$
	</p>
