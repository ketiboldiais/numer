		Symbolic logic provides the foundations of both computer science and
		mathematics. The following materials provide a review of the logic necessary
		to understanding mathematics.

<section id="logical_form_and_logical_equivalence">
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>
		An <span class="boldText">argument</span> is a sequence of statements
		leading to an assertion. The assertion at the end of the sequence is called
		the <span class="boldText">conclusion</span>, and the preceding statements
		are called <span class="boldText">premises</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we create or assess arguments, there are two things we should always
		distinguish:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The argument's <span class="italicsText">intrinsic merit</span>; and
		</li>
		<li>The argument's <span class="italicsText">form</span>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Logical analysis has no business, and provides no help, with an argument's
		intrinsic merits. Where it does help, however, is determining whether a
		conclusion <span class="italicsText">necessarily</span> follows from the
		<span class="italicsText">truth</span> of the premises.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider the argument: "If taxes are raised, then unemployment
		increases. If unemployment increases, then government expenditures increase.
		Since government expenditures did not increase, taxes were not raised."
		Strictly from a logical analysis, there are no problems with this argument.
		But, there may be problems with the argument's intrinsic merits (is it not
		the case that government expenditures can go unchanged, or even decrease,
		while taxes are raised?). Logic does not help determine whether the
		argument's premises are true (Is it true that raising taxes increases
		unemployment? Is it true that increased unemployment leads to increased
		government expenditures?). Logic can help determine whether the premises are
		conclusions that necessarily follow from other premises, but without more,
		logical analysis provides no aid here.
	</p>

<section id="logical_propositions">
	<h2>Logical Statements</h2>
	<p>
		Arguments consist of <span class="boldText">propositions</span> &mdash;
		sentences that can be assigned the values
		<span class="italicsText">true</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>, but not both. The entirety of
		mathematics is composed of terms defined by using terms previously defined.
		This process of using terms to define terms, however, had to start
		somewhere. For this reason, there are a few terms in mathematics taken to be
		<span class="italicsText">undefined</span>. The terms
		<span class="italicsText">sentence</span>,
		<span class="italicsText">true</span>, and
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>, are examples of undefined terms in
		mathematics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Following the definition of a proposition, the following sentences are
		propositions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${1 + 1 = 2}$ (true)</li>
		<li>${2^2 = 18}$ (false)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The sentence ${x^2 = 16}$ is not a proposition, because we cannot assign it
		the value true or false unless we provide some value for $x$. It is both
		true or false, depending on $x$.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="compound_propositions_logical_connectives">
	<h2>Compound Propositions &amp; Logical Connectives</h2>
	<p>
		Propositions can be connected with
		<span class="italicsText">logical connectives</span> to create
		<span class="boldText">compound propositions</span>. For example, the
		propositions "$x$ is less than <span class="italicsText">or</span> to 4" and
		"$s$ is a member of $A$ but not a member of $B$" are examples of compound
		propositions.
	</p>
	<p>
		To form compound propositions, the connected propositions must have set
		truth values. In other words, we cannot connect propositions that do not
		already have the assigned values of <span class="italicsText">true</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>. Once we
		<span class="italicsText">know</span> what the truth values for individual
		propositions, we can then connect them with logical connectives. We
		investigate the most common logical connectives in the next sections.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="not">
	<h2>Logical NOT</h2>
	<p>
		The logical connective
		<span class="monoText">NOT</span> is the
		<span class="italicsText">logical negation</span>. It takes a proposition,
		and returns the proposition with the opposite truth value. More formally:
		Let $p$ be a proposition. The negation of $p$ is "<span class="monoText"
			>NOT</span
		>
		p," or, "It is <span class="monoText">NOT</span> the case that $p$." We
		denote the negation of $p$ with ${\neg p.}$ If $p$ is true, then ${\neg p}$
		is false; if $p$ is false, then ${\neg p}$ is true.
	</p>
	<p>We can summarize the possibilities with a truth table:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>$p$</th>
				<th>${\neg p}$</th>

					<td>T</td>

			</tbody>
		</table>

</section>

<section id="and">
	<h2>Logical AND</h2>
	<p>
		The logical connective
		<span class="monoText">AND</span> is the
		<span class="italicsText">logical conjunction</span>. If $p$ and $q$ are
		propositions, then the conjunction of $p$ and $q$ is "$p$
		<span class="monoText">AND</span> $q$," denoted ${p \land q.}$ If, and only
		if, $p$ is true and $q$ is true, then ${p \land q}$ is true. If $p$ is
		false, $q$ is false, or both $p$ and $q$ are false, then ${p \land q}$ is
		false.

	<p>
		<span class="topic">NEITHER NOR.</span> The sentence structure

		The statement "<span class="monoText">NEITHER $p$ NOR $q$</span>" in logical

	<p>
		For example, consider the proposition "It is neither hot nor sunny." Let ${h

		<span class="italicsText">exclusive or</span> is used, mathematicians and

	<h3>Inequalities and Logic</h3>

		One of the most common relationships between discrete objects in mathematics

		propositions. However, they are so frequent in mathematics that we've given
		them special symbols.

	<p>
		Let $x$, $b$, and $a$ be real numbers. The following statements are compound
		propositions:
	</p>
	<ul>

		<ul>
			<li>${x < a}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${x = a}$</li>

	<h2>Logical Equivalence &amp; Propositional Forms</h2>
	<p>
		Given propositions $p$ and $q$, we can use logical connectives to construct
		the compound propositions ${\neg p}$, ${p \land q}$, and ${p \lor q.}$
		Compound propositions themselves can be connected to form more complicated
		expressions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${\neg p \lor q}$</li>
		<li>${(\neg p \lor q) \land \neg (p \lor q)}$</li>
		<li>${\neg ((p \land q) \lor (p \land (p \lor \neg q)))}$</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These complicated expressions are called
		<span class="boldText">propositional forms</span>. When determining a
		propositional form's truth value, we follow the
		<span class="italicsText">Boolean order of operations</span>:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Expressions inside brackets/parentheses are performed first</li>
		<li>The <span class="monoText">NOT</span> operator is performed second.</li>
		<li>The operator <span class="monoText">AND</span> is performed third.</li>
		<li>The operator <span class="monoText">OR</span> is performed last.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Logical Equivalence.</span> The statements "2 is greater
		than 1" and "1 is less than 2" are two different ways of saying the same

		be: (1) both true, or (2) both false. In other words, if the statements were
		connected with a logical connective and evaluated in a truth table, their
		truth values would be identical.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions. The compound propositions
		${p \land q}$ and ${q \land p}$ have the same truth values:

	<h2>De Morgan's Laws</h2>

		Consider the proposition: &#8220;Apples are reed and sweet.&#8221; This is a
		compound proposition: (1) &#8220;Apples are red&#8221; (2) &#8220;Apples are
		sweet&#8221; For the proposition to be false (the proposition's negation),
		one or both of (1) and (2) must be false. I.e., "Apples are NOT red BUT
		sweet"; "Apples are red BUT NOT sweet"; "Apples are NOT red AND are NOT
		sweet." These propositions can be reduced to a single proposition: "Apples
		are NOT red OR are NOT sweet."
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, consider the proposition: "Apples are red OR green." Like the
		<span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition above, this is a compound
		proposition: (1) "Apples are red." (2) "Apples are green." Thus, for the
		compound proposition to be false, both (1) and (2) must be false, because an

		of its component propositions are false. The negation then is: "Apples are
		NOT red AND are NOT green."
	</p>
	<p>

	<h2>De Morgan's Laws & Compound Inequalities</h2>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">De Morgan's Laws and Compound Inequalities.</span>
		Negating compound inequalities is a common source of error for novices.
		Confronted with an inequality of the form ${x < y \leq z}$, it is tempting
		to write: ${x \nless y \nleq z.}$ Temptation be gone! This is
		<span class="underlineText">wrong</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose a compound inequality of the form ${x \stackrel{?}= y \stackrel{?}=
		z}$ (the symbol ${\stackrel{?}=}$ means "unknown relation," and represents
		the possibility of any of the relation symbols $=$, $>$, $<$, $\leq$,
		$\geq$, etc.). This compound inequality consists of two component
		propositions:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${x \stackrel{?}= y}$ <span class="monoText">AND</span></li>
		<li>${y \stackrel{?}= z.}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Thus, the negation of the compound inequality is:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${\neg (x \stackrel{?}= y)}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
		<li>${\neg (y \stackrel{?}= z).}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		For example, suppose the compound inequality ${x < y \leq z.}$ The negation

	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${x \nless y}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
		<li>${y \nleq z}$.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Proposition (1), ${x \nless y,}$ means that ${x \geq y}$. Proposition (2),

	<h2>Tautologies</h2>
	<p>
		A
		<span class="boldText">tautology</span> is a propositional form that is
		<span class="italicsText">always true</span> regardless of the truth values
		of the individual propositions substituted for the propositional form's
		variables. A proposition whose form is a tautology is called a
		<span class="boldText">tautological proposition</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider the proposition: "Beijing is the capital of China OR

				</tr>
				<tr>

	</figure>
	<p>
		From the truth table above, we can see that ${p \lor \neg p}$ will always be
		true, regardless of what truth values are assigned to $p$. Thus, we say that
		${p \lor \neg p}$ is a tautology:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>

		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The symbol $\top$ is called the

		attach it next to the parentheses containing the relevant proposition to
		indicate that the proposition is a tautology.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="contradictions">
	<h2>Contradictions</h2>
	<p>
		The polar opposite of a tautology is a
		<span class="boldText">contraction</span> &mdash; a propositional form that

		values of the individual propositions substituted for the propositional
		form's variables. A proposition whose form is a contradiction is called a

	</p>
	<p>
		Example: Consider the proposition "Dogs are canines AND dogs are NOT

	<p>
		From the table above, we can see that ${d \land \neg d}$ is always false,
		regardless of the truth value of $d$. Thus, we say that ${d \land \neg d}$
		is a contradictory proposition. We denote this fact with the logical
		notation:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\bot (d \land \neg d)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>

	<h2>Negating IF-THEN Statements</h2>

	<div class="mproof">
		<div class="premises">
			<ul>
				<li>${\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q)}$</li>

				<li>the double negative law</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

	<p>Thus, we have the following fact:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\neg (p \implies q) \equiv (p \land \neg q)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, the negation of ${\texttt{"IF p THEN q"}}$ is ${\texttt{"p
		AND NOT q"}.}$ We can see this in everyday speech with the word "but." For
		example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>Negation: "I timely submit my assignment, but I lose points."</p>

	<p>For those fond of Victorian horror:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

			<p>Proposition: "If Dracula is a man, then Dracula is human"</p>
			<p>Negation: "Dracula is a man but not human."</p>
		</div>

	<p>
		As an aside, the last example might spark some thought about how we assign
		truth values to propositions. Consider for example Immanuel Kant's
		observation of three values: the "alive," the "dead," and somewhere in the
		middle, the "undead." Is there any relationship between the fact that these
		terms exist and how we evaluate the truth values of propositions? If the
		answer is yes, does the relationship affect the proposition that such a
		relationship exists?

		 A

		Observe that the biconditional "$p$ iff $q$" is logically equivalent to "$p$

		equivalent to the conjunction of the conditional and its converse.
		Symbolically:

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(p \iff q) \equiv ((p \implies q) \land (q \implies p))}$</p>
		</div>

	<p>
		This is helpful result. Biconditionals are much easier to prove or work with
		when they are reduced to the conditional and its converse.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the Boolean order of operations, the connective ${\iff}$ is coequal with
		${\implies.}$ Like ${\land}$ and ${\lor,}$ the only way to indicate one's

<section id="arguments_intro">
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>
		An <span class="boldText">argument</span> is a sequence of propositions
		leading to a conclusion. Needless to say, arguments are the building blocks
		of mathematics, so their careful study is indispensable to any budding
		mathematician. Arguments have strict terminology that we must always keep in
		mind when we evaluate them.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="logic_intro">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Arguments: Form v. Substance.</span>
		<span class="boldText">Logic</span> is the study of systematically
		evaluating arguments for <span class="italicsText">internal cogency</span>.
		There are numerous standards for internal cogency, but the standard we are
		most often concerned with in mathematics is
		<span class="boldText">logical validity</span>. Consider the argument
		synonymous with introductory logic texts:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>All men are mortal.</li>
				<li>Socrates is a man.</li>
				<li class="conc">Socrates is mortal.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From the argument, we can ask two questions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Are the <span class="boldText">premises</span> true?</li>
		<li>
			What is the <span class="italicsText">quality</span> of the
			<span class="boldText">inference steps</span> from the premises to the
			conclusion?
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		These two questions evidence a distinction: Asking whether an argument
		starts from true premises is different from asking how the argument moves
		from one proposition to the next. True, we generally want our arguments to
		satisfy both conditions. Nevertheless, they are two separate questions
		requiring different knowledge. Whether premises are true is an issue of
		<span class="italicsText">substance</span> &mdash; the question is
		determined by reference to data or known facts. Thus, the issue is within
		the expert's domain. If the argument concerns economics, then whether the
		premises are true is answered by the economist. If physics, the physicist,
		and if mathematics, the mathematician. On the other hand,
		<span class="boldText">internal cogency</span> &mdash; an argument's
		movement, or flow, from one proposition to the next &mdash; is an issue of
		<span class="italicsText">form</span>. It concerns both the expert and the
		logician.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="deduction_vs_induction">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Deduction v. Induction.</span> The argument in the
		preceding example is described as
		<span class="boldText">deductively valid</span>. Now consider this argument:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>My doctor has never poisoned anyone.</li>
				<li>The medicine I've been prescribed is a routine prescription.</li>
				<li class="conc">My doctor will not poison me.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice the difference between this argument and the preceding one. It does
		not share the same &#8220;air-tight&#8221; quality. There is nothing
		&#8220;wrong&#8221; with the argument, but it's internal cogency is
		different. When we extrapolate from past data to arrive at conclusions about
		the future, we engage in <span class="boldText">inductive reasoning</span>.
		Inductive arguments can have
		<span class="italicsText">inductively strong</span> conclusions (it his
		highly probable that, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion is
		true) or <span class="italicsText">inductively weak</span> conclusions (it
		is unlikely that, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion is true).
		Inductive reasoning is the kind of reasoning we use daily. Time management,
		decisions concerning our relationships with others, whether to buy something
		now or later, these all involve inductions. Inductive reasoning is a
		difficult and complex area of logic, and we can only study it meaningfully
		if we have a good grasp of deductive reasoning. Accordingly, we will
		relegate our discussion to deductive reasoning for now.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="argument_form">
	<h3>Argument Form</h3>
	<p>
		All arguments have an <span class="boldText">argument form</span> &mdash;
		the sequence of <span class="italicsText">propositional forms</span>. All
		propositions in an argument and all propositional forms in an argument form,
		except for the very last, are called <span class="boldText">premises</span>.
		Every premise relies on either one or more
		<span class="boldText">assumptions</span>, propositions treated as true
		without further proof, and are themselves premises in an argument. Premises
		may be <span class="boldText">explicit</span> &mdash; stated clearly to the
		audience, or <span class="boldText">implicit</span> &mdash; unstated. All
		premises lead to a final proposition or propositional form called the
		<span class="boldText">conclusion</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Implicit premises are often the best place to find weaknesses and problems
		in arguments. However, before we even assess an argument's premises, we must
		consider the argument's <span class="boldText">validity</span>. Whether an
		argument is <span class="italicsText">valid</span> depends on
		<span class="italicsText">argument form</span>. An argument is valid if, and
		only if, no matter what propositions are substituted for the proposition
		variables in the argument's premises, if the argument's premises are
		<span class="italicsText">all true</span>, then the conclusion
		<span class="italicsText">is also true</span>. If an argument satisfies this
		requirement, then the argument is <span class="boldText">valid</span>;
		otherwise, the argument is <span class="boldText">invalid</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The core requirement for validity is: If the argument's premises are all
		true, then the argument's conclusion must follow by logical form alone.
		Notice what this means. It is logically impossible for a valid argument to
		have all true premises and a false conclusion. When an argument is valid and
		its premises are true, we say that the conclusion's truth is
		<span class="boldText">inferred</span> or
		<span class="boldText">deduced</span> from the truth of the premises. If a
		conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises being true (i.e.,
		the premises are all true but the conclusion is false or the conclusion
		could be true <span class="italicsText">or</span> false), then the
		conclusion is not validly deduced.
	</p>
	<p>We can test for an argument's validity procedurally:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Identify all of the argument's assumptions.</li>
		<li>Identify all of the argument's premises.</li>
		<li>Identify the argument's conclusion.</li>
		<li>
			Identify all logical connectives linking each proposition (this constructs
			the argument's form).
		</li>
		<li>Construct a truth table:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Enumerate the truth values for the assumptions.</li>
			<li>Enumerate the truth values for the premises.</li>
			<li>Enumerate the truth values for the conclusion.</li>
			<li>
				Evaluate the truth values for the logical connectives between the
				propositions in (a) through (c).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<li>
			If a row in the truth table shows all of the premises are true, that row
			is called the <span class="boldText">critical row</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			If there is a critical row where the conclusion is false, then it is
			<span class="italicsText">possible</span> for an argument of the given
			form to have true premises and a false conclusion, so the argument form is
			<span class="boldText">invalid</span>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Else, if the conclusion of
			<span class="underlineText">every critical row</span> is true, then the
			argument form is <span class="boldText">valid</span>.
		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section id="modus_ponens">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Modus Ponens.</span> An argument form composed of two
		premises and a conclusion is called a
		<span class="boldText">syllogism</span>. The first premise is called the

		<span class="boldText">minor premise</span>. A syllogism we are likely all

		<span class="topic">Generalization</span> Valid argument forms are called
		<span class="boldText">rules of inference</span>. Thus, argument forms like
		<span class="italicsText">modus ponens</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">modus tollens</span> are rules of inference. One
		rule of inference is <span class="boldText">generalization</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${p}$</li>
				<li class="conc">${p \lor q}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Similarly:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${q}$</li>
				<li class="conc">${p \lor q}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Generalization allows us to infer that, if $p$ is true, then any proposition
		logically connected to $p$ with an <span class="monoText">OR</span> is true.
		For example, suppose that the proposition "Apples are red" is true. From
		generalization, we can conclude that, more generally, "Apples are red or
		apples are green" is true.
	</p>

		As an example: Suppose we are counting the number of seeding plants in our
		green house. We reach plant $x$, and find that it is labeled, "dicot." We
		can then conclude:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>$x$ is a dicot</li>
				<li class="conc">
					(<span class="italicsText">more generally</span>) $x$ is a dicot

	<p>Knowing that seeding plants includes dicots and monocots, we tally $x$.</p>
</section>

<section id="specialization">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Specialization.</span> Another rule of inference is
		<span class="boldText">specialization</span>. Specialization takes the
		following argument form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${p \land q}$</li>
				<li class="conc">$p$</li>
			</ul>

	<p>Similarly,</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${p \land q}$</li>
				<li class="conc">$q$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>A truth table demonstrates specialization's validity:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>$p$</th>
				<th>$q$</th>
				<th>${p \land q}$</th>
				<th>$p$</th>

	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, suppose we are told the following proposition is true:
		&#8220;Ada is a computer scientist and a mathematician.&#8221; With
		specialization, we can validly argue:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>Ada is a computer scientist and Ada is a mathematician.</li>
				<li class="conc">
					(<span class="italicsText">in particular</span>) Ada is a computer
					scientist.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Generalization and specialization are often the first steps to reaching new
		mathematical results. Not every fact is relevant in mathematical inquiry,
		but neither do we always have enough facts. Generalization and
		specialization allow us to expand or shrink the pool of "givens," tailoring
		known facts to fit into the hypotheses of known theorems.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="elimination">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Elimination.</span>
		<span class="boldText">Elimination</span> is another rule of inference used
		extensively in mathematics. It takes the following form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${p \lor q}$</li>
				<li>${\neg q}$</li>
				<li class="conc">${p}$</li>

	<p>Similiarly:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${p \lor q}$</li>
				<li>${\neg p}$</li>
				<li class="conc">${q}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Elimination provides that given the compound proposition $x$, consisting of
		an $n$ number of propositions all linked with an
		<span class="monoText">OR</span>, if we prove that all of the component
		propositions are false <span class="underlineText">except</span> one
		component proposition $y$, it must be the case that $y$ is true. This is
		effectively the strategy of eliminating all possible cases to prove that a
		particular case is true.

		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>

<section id="transitivity">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Transitivity.</span> A frequent argument in mathematics
		is a chain of <span class="monoText">if-then</span> statements. We find that
		one fact is true, which implies that a second a fact is true, which implies
		a third fact is true. <span class="boldText">Transitivity</span> is the rule
		of inference that allows us to conclude, "Because the first fact is true,
		this third fact is true." The rule takes the form:

<section id="proof_by_division_into_cases">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Proof-by-Division-into-Cases.</span> The rule of

	<figure class="math-display">

	<p>
		Proof-by-division-into-cases is particularly useful when we know that one
		proposition or another proposition is true. If we show that, either or, a
		certain conclusion follows, then such a conclusion must be true. For
		example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

<section id="logical_errors">
	<h3>Fallacies</h3>
	<p>
		An error in deductive reasoning is
		called a <span class="boldText">fallacy</span>. A fallacy automatically
		results in an invalid argument, greatly reducing the argument's strength and
		credibility. As with valid arguments, we can spot fallacies by finding at
		least one critical row where all the argument's premises are true and the
		conclusion is false. Alternatively, we can identify fallacies by
		<span class="boldText">analogizing</span> &mdash; we find an argument $A$ of
		the same form, then show that argument $A$ has true premises and a false
		conclusion (remember, the standard of validity applies to all arguments;
		validity pertains to <span class="italicsText">form</span>, not
		<span class="italicsText">substance</span>). In the next sections, we
		identify several common fallacies.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="converse_error">
	<h3>The Converse Error.</h3>
	<p>
		Consider the following
		argument:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>If Loki is a man, then Loki is human.</li>
				<li>Loki is human.</li>
				<li class="conc">Loki is a man.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an invalid argument. The fact that Loki is human does not preclude
		Loki being a woman or of non-binary identification. The fallacy in the
		argument above is called a <span class="boldText">converse error </span
		><sup>2</sup> &mdash; concluding that the sufficient condition is true
		because the necessary condition is true. The converse error takes the form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${p \implies q}$</li>
				<li>${q}$</li>
				<li class="conc">${p}$</li>

<section id="inverse_error">
	<h3>The Inverse Error.</h3>
	<p>
		Here's another invalid
		argument:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

	<p>
		This argument is invalid because a wolf could very well have suckled Romulus
		even if Romulus's mother was not a wolf. Indeed, both Romulus and Remus were
		suckled by a she-wolf (unusual, but
		<span class="italicsText">possible</span>). The error here is called an

<section id="valid_arguments_false_premiseAndconclusion">
	<h3>Valid Arguments with False Premises and a False Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		The fact that an argument rests on false premises and results in a false
		conclusion <span class="underlineText">does not</span> prevent the argument
		from being <span class="underlineText">valid</span>. For example, this
		argument is deductively valid:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>The city of Versailles is the capital of France.</li>
				<li>
					If a city is a country's capital, then it is the country's largest
					city.
				</li>
				<li class="conc">Versailles is France's largest city.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The premises above are all false. Paris is the capital of france, and there
		are numerous countries where the largest city is not the capital (e.g.,
		Washington D.C. is the United States's capital, but it dwarfs in comparison
		to New York City by any metric). The conclusion is also false &mdash;
		Versailles is small compared to Paris, Arles, Marseille, or Toulouse.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nevertheless, the argument is deductively valid. It is a simple exercise of
		<span class="italicsText">modus ponens</span>. Again, validity concerns
		form, not susbstance.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="valid_arguments_false_premiseAndTrueConclusion">
	<h3>Valid Arguments with Falses Premises and a True Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		Similarly, the fact that an argument rests on false premises and results in
		a true conclusion <span class="underlineText">does not prevent</span> the
		argument from being <span class="underlineText">valid</span>. Here's a valid
		argument:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>If an organism is a moth, then the organism is a human.</li>
				<li>Brad Pitt is an organism that is a moth.</li>
				<li class="conc">Brad Pitt is a human.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The premises above are all false. Moths are not humans, and Brad Pitt is
		certainly not a moth. But, the conclusion is true &mdash; Brad Pitt is a
		human. But, like the previous example, this is another simple exercise of
		<span class="italicsText">modus ponens</span>, a valid argument form.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="invalid_argument_with_true_premisesAndconclusion">
	<h3>Invalid Arguments with True Premises and a True Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		The fact that an argument rests on true premises and results in a true

	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">

				<li>If an animal is a reptile, then the animal is cold-blooded.</li>
				<li>Crocodiles are cold-blooded animals.</li>
				<li class="conc">Crocodiles are reptiles.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The above argument's premises and conclusion are all true. However, the

		that the sufficient condition is true because the necessary condition is
		true.

</section>

<section id="sound_arguments">
	<h2>Sound Arguments</h2>
	<p>If an argument satisfies these two conditions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The argument is valid; <span class="underlineText">and</span></li>
		<li>all of the argument's premises are true</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		then we say that the argument is <span class="boldText">sound</span>. More
		generally, the property of
		<span class="italicsText">soundness</span> results when an argument
		satisifies the relevant standards of
		<span class="italicsText">form</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">substance</span>. Soundness is the standard for
		obtaining new mathematical results. Validity is the bare minimum. This is
		because there are three different possibilities for valid arguments:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>true premises and a true conclusion</li>
		<li>false premise(s) and a true conclusion</li>
		<li>false premise(s) and a false conclusion</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Soundness ensures that only the first possibility occurs with valid argument
		forms: We accept a conclusion as fact in mathematics
		<span class="boldText">only if</span> the argument producing that conclusion
		is <span class="boldText">sound</span>.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="contradiction">
	<h2>Contradiction</h2>
	<p>
		The principle of <span class="boldText">contradiction</span> is a
		cornerstone of mathematics. It is at the very heart of the method of
		<span class="italicsText">proof by contradiction</span>. Suppose $p$ is a
		proposition we wish to deduce. We can prove that $p$ is true with the
		following argument form:
	</p>
	<div class="mproof">
		<div class="premises">
			<ul>
				<li>Suppose that $p$ is false.</li>
				<li>assumption</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>If $p$ is false, then there is a logical contradiction.</li>
				<li>the data</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>$p$ is false.</li>
				<li>the assumption</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>&#8756; $p$ must be true.</li>
				<li>the contradiction rule</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="conclusion">
			<ul>
				<li>$p$ is true</li>
				<li>Q.E.D.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		The critical step in this argument is the second premise: That there is a
		logical contradiction if $p$ is false. For this premise to be true, $p$
		being false must contradict the <span class="boldText">data</span> &mdash;
		what we know as facts. This rule of inference is called the
		<span class="boldText">contradiction rule</span>. Symbolically:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>${\neg p \implies \bot}$</li>
				<li>${\neg p}$</li>
				<li class="conc">${p}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The contradiction rule can be proved with a truth table:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>${p}$</th>
				<th>${\neg p}$</th>
				<th>${\bot}$</th>
				<th>${\neg p \implies \bot}$</th>

	</figure>
	<p>
		<span class="boldText">Eliminating possible cases.</span> The contradiction
		rule also allows us to narrow down possible cases by way of a powerful rule:
		If an assumption leads to a contradiction, then that assumption
		<span class="underlineText">must be false</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example of how useful this rule is, consider the following problem
		presented by the logician Raymond Smullyan:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There exists an island with two types of inhabitants:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Knights who always tell the truth; and</li>
			<li>Knaves who always lie.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>
			On visiting the island, you are approached by two natives, $A$ and $B$,
			who state:
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>$A$: $B$ is a knight.</li>
			<li>$B$: $A$ and I are of opposite type.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>What are $A$ and $B$?</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Answer</summary>
		<p>First, we observe that there are four possibilites:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>$A$ is a knight and $B$ is a knight.</li>
			<li>$A$ is a knight and $B$ is a knave.</li>
			<li>$A$ is a knave and $B$ is a knight.</li>
			<li>$A$ is a knave and $B$ is a knave.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Next, suppose that $A$ is a knight. If $A$ is a knight, then $A$ always
			tells the truth. Thus, $B$ is a knight. But, if $B$ is a knight, then $B$
			always tells the truth, so $A$ is a knave. This is a contradiction. Thus,
			$A$ cannot be a knight. $A$ must be a knave.
		</p>
		<p>
			If $A$ is a knave, then $A$ always tells lies. Thus, $B$ is not a knight.
			$B$ is therefore a knave. And since $B$ is a knave, $B$ always tells lies,
			so $A$ and $B$ are not of opposite type. Accordingly, both $A$ and $B$ are
			knaves.

<section id="quantified_statements">
	<h2>Logic of Quantified Statements</h2>
	<p>Recall the famous argument:</p>

		We cannot determine this argument's validity with the previous tools we
		used, ${\neg,}$ ${\land,}$ ${\lor,}$ ${\implies,}$ and ${\iff.}$ Those tools
		are exclusive to
		<span class="boldText">propositional calculus</span> &mdash; the symbolic
		analysis of <span class="italicsText">ordinary compound statements</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, the argument above requires
		<span class="boldText">predicate calculus</span> &mdash; the symbolic
		analysis of <span class="italicsText">predicates</span> and
		<span class="italicsText">quantified statements</span>. Predicate calculus
		requires us to take a closer look at words like &#8220;all,&#8221;
		&#8220;some,&#8221; and &#8220;is,&#8221; to name a few.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">What is a predicate?</span> In everyday grammar, a
		<span class="italicsText">predicate</span> is the part of the sentence that
		gives information about the subject. For example, the sentence,
		&#8220;Bertrand Russell is a British philosopher.&#8221; The subject is
		&#8220;Bertrand Russell&#8221; and the predicate is &#8220;is a British
		philosopher.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		In logic, we obtain predicates by isolating various parts of the sentence.
		From the previous example, we can isolate the sentence into several
		variables:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>Let ${P \coloneqq \text{"is a British philosopher"}}$</p>
			<p>Let ${Q \coloneqq \text{"is a British"}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The symbols $P$ and $Q$ are called
		<span class="boldText">predicate symbols</span>, and we can use them to
		generalize the example sentence. For example, the sentence &#8220;$x$ is a
		British philosopher&#8221; can be symbolized as ${P(x).}$ Likewise, the
		sentence &#8220;$x$ is a British $y$&#8221; can be symbolized as ${Q(x,
		y).}$ The variables $x$ and $y$ are called
		<span class="boldText">predicate variables</span>, which take values from
		specified sets. When concrete values are substituted into those variables,
		we obtain a <span class="boldText">sentence</span>. Otherwise, these
		generalized sentences, ${P(x)}$ and ${Q(x, y),}$ are called by various
		names: <span class="boldText">propositional functions</span>,
		<span class="boldText">open sentences</span>, or
		<span class="boldText">open formulas</span>.
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Definition</span>. An
			<span class="boldItalics">open formula</span> is a sentence that contains

		Once a value is substituted into a propositional function's variable, the
		proposotional function outputs a proposition, which, as we know, is either
		true or false. The set of all values taken by the propositional function so
		as to output true propositions is called the propositional function's
		<span class="boldText">truth set</span>.

	<h2>Quantifiers</h2>
	<p>
		A <span class="boldText">quantifier</span> is a logical operator that
		specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse ${\mathbb{D}}$
		satisfy a propositional function. Like the logical connectives, quantifiers
		come in various forms: &#8220;all,&#8221; &#8220;some,&#8221; &#8220;at
		least one,&#8221; &#8220;none,&#8221; etc. These words all serve to
		answering the question: Given an open formula ${P(x),}$ for how many
		individuals in ${\mathbb{D}}$ is ${P(x)}$ true? We explore these quantifiers
		below.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Universal Quantifier: ${\forall}$</span>. The
		universal quantifier is indicated by a variety of words. Below is a short
		list of the most common indicators.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&#8220;every&#8221;</li>
		<li>&#8220;each&#8221;</li>
		<li>&#8220;all&#8221;</li>
		<li>&#8220;any&#8221;</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Consider, for example, the sentence &#8220;All hippos are mammals.&#8221; We
		can formalize this sentence with the following:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\forall x \in H: \text{ $x$ is a mammal.}}$</p>
			<ul class="def">
				<li class="where">${H \coloneqq \text{the set of all hippos.}}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can also use ${\forall}$ for multiple variables:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				Open Formula: &#8220;For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, ${x + y = y +
				x.}$&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>Symbolic: ${\forall x \text{ and } y, \space x + y = y + x}$</p>
			<p>Formal Symbolism: ${\forall x, y \in \R : x + y = y + x}$</p>

		In the exercises above, we proved particular propositions false by checking

		whenever a proposition's domain is finite (of course, assuming we do not

	</p>
	<p>
		Most propositions in mathematics, however, will have domains with infinite
		individuals, or, if not infinite, a large enough size to render the method
		of exhaustion impractical. For this reason, the method of exhaustion rarely
		work for producing general mathematical propositions. Nevertheless, it is a
		method we should always consider when confronting logical predicates.

			<p>The number 12 can be written as a sum of two even integers.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The key word in the above statement is the word &#8220;can.&#8221; That

		of existence. In this case, the existence of two even integers that summate
		to 12.

	<h2>Negating Universal Quantifiers</h2>

		<div class="rule">
			<p>&#8220;All angels love humanity.&#8221;</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What might be the negation for this statement? Some might quickly jump to
		&#8220;No angels love humanity.&#8221; But this would be false &mdash;
		Lucifer might want to have a word on the matter. Owing to his intelligence,
		he might appeal to logic rather than Genesis, and he would win on that
		shoulder. The correct negation for the statement above is: &#8220;There
		exists at least one angel that does not love humanity.&#8221;
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, if we see a proposition asserting &#8220;all ... are ...&#8221; or
		&#8220;every ... is ...,&#8221; then the proposition's negation is
		&#8220;some are not&#8221; or &#8220;there is at least one that is
		not.&#8221; More formally:

		What is the negation of this statement? The negation asserts the

		proposition effectively states, if we checked every single human, we would
		find that not a single one of them is a robot.

		Hence, whenever we see a proposition asserting &#8220;some are&#8221; or

	<h2>Vacuous Truth</h2>

		At a conference, there is 1

		is false. The negation: &#8220;There is at least one attendee that is not a
		mathematician.&#8221; Clearly, this is true, since the physicist attends.
		Hence, John's statement is false.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, suppose the conference has no attendees. John again says, &#8220;All

<section id="multiple_quantifiers">
	<h2>Multiple Quantifiers</h2>
	<p>
		Consider the following
		statement:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>There is a teaching assistant supervising every student section.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of a statement containing multiple quantifiers. Moreover,
		it is an <span class="italicsText">ambiguous</span> statement because there
		are two possible interpretations: (1) There is a single teaching assistant
		supervising all of the student sections; or (2) For each student section,
		there is exactly one teaching assistant supervising. In everyday speech, we
		rely on context to resolve this ambiguity. If there are 20 student sections
		occurring at different times, some simultaneously, then (2) is likely the
		correct interpretation.
	</p>

	<p>
		In mathematics, we <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> rely on
		context, and ambiguity must be quickly rooted out or prevented at all costs.
		This is done by ensuring our statements conform to established rules. The
		core rule:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Rule.</span> When a statement contains multiple
				quantifiers, we assume the actions suggested by the quantifiers are
				performed in the order in which they occur.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>For example, suppose:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\forall x \in D : (\exists y \in E : P(x, y))}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The statement above is read: For all ${x}$ in ${D,}$ there exists a ${y}$ in
		${E}$ such that the property ${P}$ holds for ${x}$ and ${y.}$ For the
		proposition to be true, the following must be true:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Suppose someone selected <span class="underlineText">any</span> element in
			${D,}$ call it ${x.}$
		</li>
		<li>Then suppose she looks inside ${E.}$</li>
		<li>
			She would find that there is an element ${y}$ inside ${E}$ such that both
			${x}$ and ${y}$ satisfy property ${P.}$
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Now consider the following statement:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\exists x \in D : [\forall y \in E : P(x, y)]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		We read the statement above as: There exists an ${x}$ in ${D}$ such that,
		for all ${y}$ in ${E,}$ the property ${P}$ holds for both ${x}$ and ${y.}$
	</p>

	<p>To prove the statement is true, we must prove the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Suppose someone selects <span class="underlineText">any</span> ${y}$ in
			${E.}$
		</li>
		<li>
			Then, she can find at least one ${x}$ in ${D}$ such that ${x}$ and ${y}$
			will always satisfy the property ${P.}$
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		In other words, we must find an ${x}$ will work to satisfy ${P(x, y)}$ no
		matter what ${y}$ is selected.

		<span class="topic">Negating Multiple Quantifier Statements.</span> Consider

<section id="arguments_with_quantified_statements">
	<h2>Arguments with Quantified Statements</h2>
	<p>
		Below are some of the most common argument forms and rules related to
		quantified statements.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Universal Instantiation.</span> If a property is true
		for everything in a set, then it is true for a particular member of that
		set. A famous example:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>All men are mortal.</li>
				<li>Socrates is a man.</li>
				<li class="conc">Socrates is mortal.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Universal instantiation is the foundational principle of deductive logic.
		Because ${x}$ is an instance of a particular type ${m,}$ and we know that
		all instances of type ${m}$ inherit property ${N,}$ it must be true that
		${x}$ has the property ${N.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Universal Modus Ponens.</span> Consider the following
		argument:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ul class="larg">
				<li>
					For all mangoes, if the mango is yellow, then the mango is ripe.
				</li>
				<li>This fruit is a yellow mango.</li>
				<li class="conc">This fruit is a ripe mango.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is an example of
		<span class="italicsText">universal modus ponens</span>. More formally:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> The argument form
				<span class="italicsText">universal modus ponens</span> takes the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>${\forall x \in D : [P(x) \implies Q(x)]}$</li>
						<li>${a \in D : P(a)}$</li>
						<li class="conc">${Q(a)}$</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Universal Modus Tollens.</span> Now consider this

			<ul class="larg">
				<li>All humans are mortal.</li>
				<li>Zeus is not mortal.</li>
				<li class="conc">Zeus is not human.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We call this argument form
		<span class="italicsText">universal modus tollens</span>. The argument
		provides: All instances of ${x}$ have some property ${P.}$ Since ${z}$ does
		not have the property ${P,}$ ${z}$ is not an instance of ${x.}$

<section id="translating_quantifiers">
	<h2>Translating Informal Language to Formal Logic</h2>
	<p>
		To properly analyze statements, we must be able to quickly translate
		informal language to formal logic and vice versa. Below are translation
		methods, both for propositional and predicate calculus.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Exclusive Disjunction</span>. The word
		<span class="italicsText">or</span>, by default, is inclusive. Thus, given
		two propositions $p$ and $q$, When we refer to the
		<span class="italicsText">exclusive or</span>, we mean ${(p \lor q) \land
		(\neg (p \land q)),}$ or ${p \oplus q}$ for short.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that when we say ${p \oplus q,}$ we are saying that $p$ and $q$ have
		different truth-values. Because they have different truth values, we are
		denying the biconditional ${p \iff q.}$ Thus, ${(p \oplus q) \implies (\neg
		(p \iff q.))}$
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the sentence &#8220;Either John is lying or Jane is
		lying&#8221; implies that it cannot be true that John or Jane is lying if
		and only if the other is lying.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Conjunctions</span>. The following words all indicate a
		conjunction:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&#8220;and&#8221;</li>
		<li>&#8220;including&#8221;</li>
		<li>&#8220;but&#8221;</li>

		<li>&#8220;even though&#8221;</li>
		<li>&#8220;additionally&#8221;</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Conjunctions often connect nouns or adjectives rather than propositions.
		When confronted with such conjunctions, there are individual propositions.
	</p>
	<div class="compare">
		<div>
			<p>&#8220;John and Jane are siblings.&#8221;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&#8220;John is a sibling.&#8221;</li>
