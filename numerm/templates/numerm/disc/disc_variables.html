	<h3>Variables &amp; Statements</h3>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Variables.</span> In mathematics, we use
		<span class="boldText">variables</span> as placeholders, or temporary names.
		Variables allow us to both
		<span class="italicsText">abstract</span> problems and perform concrete
		computations of abstractions. For example: "Is there a number where tripling
		it and adding one is the same as squaring?" While this may seem verbose for
		some, it was how mathematics was done up until the 16th century &mdash; most
		everything was in prose. Queue the variable:
	</p>

	<figure>${ 3x + 1 = x^2 }$</figure>

	<p>
		The above equation reduces a string of 72 characters down to just 12, while
		retaining the original string's meaning. Variables are indispensible to
		mathematics and related fields like computer science.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some statements can be meaningfully assigned a true or false value. We call
		such statements &mdash; statements with a
		<span class="term">truth value</span> &mdash;
		<span class="term">propositions</span>. We denote propositions with
		lowercase letters &mdash; most commonly, ${p,}$ ${q,}$ ${r,}$ and ${s.}$
		Formally:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Axiom.</span> There exists a class ${C}$ of
				statements of which we can assign one, and only one, of the words true
				and false. The members of this class are called propositions.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Some propositions are accepted as true without any further reason. We might
		call these "foundational assumptions;" the assumptions necessary for laying
		basic premises and further inferences. We call these propositions
		<span class="term">axioms</span>.
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> An
				<span class="italicsText">axiom</span> is an initial proposition assumed
				to be true.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Axioms are a special subclass of propositions. All axioms are propositions,
		but more specifically, they are propositions whose truth values we do not
		know with certainty, but we assume them to be true.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Universal Statements.</span>A
		<span class="boldText">universal statement</span> is a statement that
		claims: A certain property is true for all elements in a set.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, "All negative numbers are less than 0." This is a universal
		statement. It states a property, "less than 0," is true for all elements in
		a set, "all negative numbers." Universal statements are used beyond
		mathematics as well. "All cats are mammals" is another example.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Conditional Statements.</span> A
		<span class="boldText">conditional statement</span> is a statement that
		claims: <span class="underlineText">If</span> one thing is true,
		<span class="underlineText">then</span> some other thing must also be true.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the statement "If a number is divisible by 6, then it is also
		divisible by 3," is a conditional statement. We use conditional statements
		all the time: "If I do my homework, then I can play Madden."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Existential Statements.</span> An
		<span class="boldText">existential statement</span> is a statement that
		claims, "There is at least one thing for which this property is true." That
		property may or may be true for <span class="italicsText">all</span> things,
		but the existential statement says, "Maybe not for all, but there is at
		least one."
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, "There is a prime number that is even." This is an existential
		statement, since it claims that there is at least one thing, "a prime
		number," for which the property, "is even", is true. Another example: "Some
		people hate mayonnaise" is an existential statement, since it claims that
		there is <span class="italicsText">at lease one</span> person who hates
		mayonnaise.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Universal Conditional Statements.</span> A
		<span class="boldText">universal conditional statement</span> is a statement
		that claims: "For all of these things, if this is true, then that is true."
		In other words, the
		<span class="italicsText">universal conditional</span> is a statement that
		is both conditional <span class="italicsText">and</span> universal.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, "For all U.S. citizens, if a citizen is not at least 18, then
		the citizen cannot vote" is a universal conditional statement. It contains a
		universal statement, "For all U.S. citizens," and a conditional, "if a
		citizen is not at least 18, then the citizen cannot vote."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Universal Existential Statements.</span> A
		<span class="boldText">universal existential statement</span> is a statement
		that claims: "For all of these particular things, there is a property that
		is true for them."
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, the statement, "Every real number has an additive inverse" is a
		universal exisential statement. It claims that for all these particular
		things ("real numbers"), there is a property ("has an additive inverse"),
		that is true for them. Another example: "All humans need sleep." The
		statement is universal ("all humans"), and it asserts the existence of
		something ("sleep").
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Existential Universal Statements.</span> An
		<span class="boldText">existential universal statement</span> is a statement
		that claims: "There is a thing that satisfies a property for all things of a
		particular kind." The statement asserts existence (there is a thing), and it
		asserts universality (a property of
		<span class="italicsText">all</span> things).
	</p>
	<p>
		For example: "There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to
		every positive integer." This is an existential universal statement. Another
		example: "There is a chemical that is toxic to all people."
