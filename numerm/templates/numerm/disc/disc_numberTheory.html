	<h4>Number Theory</h4>
	<p>
		<span class="italicsText">Number theory</span> is the study of the integers.
		Despite being one of the oldest fields in mathematics, there is still a
		great deal to explore. Many of those discoveries have widespread
		implications, most commonly in cryptography &mdash; the study of hiding
		numbers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here is a simple number theory problem: We have two jugs, one can only hold
		3 gallons, the other can only hold 5 gallons. Assume we have an infinite
		amount of water from a fountain. How do we fill one of the jugs with exactly
		4 gallons of water using only the two jugs?
	</p>

	<p>
		First, we fill up the 3-gallon jug. Second, we pour all of its water into
		the 5-gallon. Third, we fill up the 3-gallon jug again and fill up the
		5-gallon. This means exactly 2 gallons can go into the 5-gallon, leaving 1
		gallon inside the 3-gallon jug. Fourth, we empty the 5-gallon, and pour the
		water inside the 3-gallon into the 5-gallon. Fifth, we fill up the 3-gallon
		and pour all of its water into the 5-gallon, which had previously contained
		just 1 gallon. We now have 4 gallons.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a beautiful solution, but the real wonder is how a small change to
		the original problem can drastically change its difficulty. If the 5-gallon
		jug were instead a 6-gallon jug, then there would be no solution, since
		every pouring would be some multiple of 3.
	</p>

	<p>Let's provide some definitions. First, the notation for &#8220;divides&#8221;:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> When we write ${m
				\space\vert\space a,}$ we mean that ${m}$ divides ${a.}$ We define
				"${m}$ divides ${a}$" as such:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${m \space\vert\space a \iff \exists k \in \Z : (a = k \cdot m)}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In other words, ${m \space\vert\space a}$ is true if, and only if, there
				exists an integer ${k}$ such that ${a}$ can be written as ${(k)(m).}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, ${3 \space\vert\space 6}$ is true, because 6 can be written as
		${(3)(2),}$ and 2 is an integer. Here is an interesting case: If ${a = 0,}$
		then any integer ${k}$ will divide ${a.}$ Thus, the proposition ${m
		\space\vert\space 0}$ is true for all integers.
