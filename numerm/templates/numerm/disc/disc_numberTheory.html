	<h4>Number Theory</h4>
	<p>
		<span class="italicsText">Number theory</span> is the study of the integers.
		Despite being one of the oldest fields in mathematics, there is still a
		great deal to explore. Many of those discoveries have widespread
		implications, most commonly in cryptography &mdash; the study of hiding
		numbers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here is a simple number theory problem: We have two jugs, one can only hold
		3 gallons, the other can only hold 5 gallons. Assume we have an infinite
		amount of water from a fountain. How do we fill one of the jugs with exactly
		4 gallons of water using only the two jugs?
	</p>

	<p>
		First, we fill up the 3-gallon jug. Second, we pour all of its water into
		the 5-gallon. Third, we fill up the 3-gallon jug again and fill up the
		5-gallon. This means exactly 2 gallons can go into the 5-gallon, leaving 1
		gallon inside the 3-gallon jug. Fourth, we empty the 5-gallon, and pour the
		water inside the 3-gallon into the 5-gallon. Fifth, we fill up the 3-gallon
		and pour all of its water into the 5-gallon, which had previously contained
		just 1 gallon. We now have 4 gallons.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a beautiful solution, but the real wonder is how a small change to
		the original problem can drastically change its difficulty. If the 5-gallon
		jug were instead a 6-gallon jug, then there would be no solution, since
		every pouring would be some multiple of 3.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let's provide some definitions. First, the notation for
		&#8220;divides&#8221;:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> When we write ${m
				\space\vert\space a,}$ we mean that ${m}$ divides ${a.}$ We define
				"${m}$ divides ${a}$" as such:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${m \space\vert\space a \iff \exists k \in \Z : (a = k \cdot m)}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In other words, ${m \space\vert\space a}$ is true if, and only if, there
				exists an integer ${k}$ such that ${a}$ can be written as ${(k)(m).}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, ${3 \space\vert\space 6}$ is true, because 6 can be written as
		${(3)(2),}$ and 2 is an integer. Here is an interesting case: If ${a = 0,}$
		then any integer ${k}$ will divide ${a.}$ Thus, the proposition ${m
		\space\vert\space 0}$ is true for all integers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Using this idea, <span class="term">divisibility</span>, we revisit the
		jug-filling problem with more formality. First, let's state our assumptions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>
					There is an ${a-}$gallon jug (in the original jug-filling game, ${a =
					3.}$)
				</li>
				<li>
					Suppose further there is a ${b-}$gallon jug (in the original, ${b =
					5}$)
				</li>
				<li>Finally, suppose ${a}$ is at most ${b.}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Now let's state our hypothesis:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m}$
				should divide any result from pouring, emptying, and filling the jugs.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		To prove (or disprove) this hypothesis, we employ a new proving tool. Here,
		we want to think of <span class="term">modeling</span> this problem. By
		modeling, we mean outlining the possible
		<span class="term">states</span> the problem can take. A
		<span class="term">state</span> is simply the set of all current facts in a
		problem. This is fairly vague and abstract, so let's apply the tool. In our
		problem, we have several states. First, we have the numbers of gallons in
		the two jugs. We can denote these numbers with ordered pairs:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>${(x, y) \coloneqq}$ the numbers of gallons in the two jugs</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class="def">
				<li class="where">
					${x \coloneqq}$ the number of gallons in the ${a-}$jug, and
				</li>
				<li>${y \coloneqq}$ the number of gallons in the ${b-}$jug.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>We can also define the start state:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>
					In the start state, there is nothing in each of the jugs. Thus, in the
					start state, the numbers of gallons in the two jugs is ${(0,0).}$
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		These look like a sufficient number of states, and we can't really think of
		anything more useful.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>When writing proofs, it's often best to write out what comes to mind, and
			if we can't think of anything else immediately, simply move to another
			though.</span
		>
		Let's now think about the <span class="term">transitions</span> &mdash; the
		set of all possible ways we can move from one state to another. One
		transition is emptying a jug:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>If we empty the ${a-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (0, y)}$</li>
				<li>If we empty the ${b-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (x, 0)}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Another transition is filling.</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>If we fill the ${a-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (a, y).}$</li>
				<li>If we fill the ${b-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (x, b).}$</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class="def">
				<li class="where">${a > x}$ and ${b > y.}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Finally, we have pouring. This is a somewhat more complex transition.</p>
