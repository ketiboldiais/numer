	<p>
		<span class="italicsText">Number theory</span> is the study of the integers.
		Despite being one of the oldest fields in mathematics, there is still a
		great deal to explore. Many of those discoveries have widespread
		implications, most commonly in cryptography &mdash; the study of hiding
		numbers.

	<h2>Motivating Problem</h2>
	<p>
		Here is a simple number theory problem: We have two jugs, one can only hold
		3 gallons, the other can only hold 5 gallons. Assume we have an infinite
		amount of water from a fountain. How do we fill one of the jugs with exactly
		4 gallons of water using only the two jugs?
	</p>

	<p>
		First, we fill up the 3-gallon jug. Second, we pour all of its water into
		the 5-gallon. Third, we fill up the 3-gallon jug again and fill up the
		5-gallon. This means exactly 2 gallons can go into the 5-gallon, leaving 1
		gallon inside the 3-gallon jug. Fourth, we empty the 5-gallon, and pour the
		water inside the 3-gallon into the 5-gallon. Fifth, we fill up the 3-gallon
		and pour all of its water into the 5-gallon, which had previously contained
		just 1 gallon. We now have 4 gallons.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is a beautiful solution, but the real wonder is how a small change to
		the original problem can drastically change its difficulty. If the 5-gallon
		jug were instead a 6-gallon jug, then there would be no solution, since
		every pouring would be some multiple of 3.
	</p>

	<p>
		To understand why this occurs, we should construct a proof for why the
		solution works. Before we construct that proof, however, we must explore the
		number theory idea of divisibility.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="divisibility">
	<h2>Divisibility</h2>
	<p>
		To better understand the proof above, we explore the concept of divisiblity.
		When we divide an integer by a positive integer, we obtain a
		<span class="term">quotient</span> and a
		<span class="term">remainder</span>. Remainders are the building blocks for
		<span class="term">modular arithmetic</span>, a topic we will explore
		further in the following materials.
	</p>

	<p>
		When an integer is divided by a nonzero integer, the quotient may or may not
		be an integer. For example, ${15/5 = 3.}$ However, ${15/2 = 7.5}$ Suppose
		${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers. If ${b / a}$ returns an integer, then we say
		&#8220;${a}$ divides ${b.}$&#8221; More formally:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose ${a, b \in \Z,}$ and ${a
				\neq 0.}$ If ${b/a \in \Z,}$ then we say that &#8220;${a}$ divides
				${b,}$&#8221; denoted:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a \space\vert\space b}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If ${a \space\vert\space b}$ is true, then ${a}$ is a
				<span class="term">factor</span>, or <span class="term">divisor</span>,
				of ${b,}$ and ${b}$ is a <span class="term">multiple</span> of ${a.}$
				Further:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${m \space\vert\space a \iff \exists k \in \Z : (a = k \cdot m)}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In other words, ${m \space\vert\space a}$ is true if, and only if, there
				exists an integer ${k}$ such that ${a}$ can be written as ${(k)(m).}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, ${3 \space\vert\space 6}$ is true, because 6 can be written as
		${(3)(2),}$ and 2 is an integer. Here is an interesting case: If ${a = 0,}$
		then any integer ${k}$ will divide ${a.}$ Thus, the proposition ${m
		\space\vert\space 0}$ is true for all integers.
	</p>

	<p>
		The definition for divisibility implies several other propositions. We state
		these as lemmas:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Lemma.</span> Let ${a, b, c \in \Z.}$ Then:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					${a \space\vert\space b \land a \space\vert\space c \implies a
					\space\vert\space (b + c)}$
				</li>
				<li>
					${\forall c \in \Z : [(a \space\vert\space b) \implies (a
					\space\vert\space b \cdot c)]}$
				</li>
				<li>
					${[(a \space\vert\space b) \land (b \space\vert\space c)] \implies (a
					\space\vert\space c)}$
				</li>
				<li>
					${\forall s, t: [(a \space\vert\space b \land a \space\vert\space c)
					\implies (a \space\vert\space sb + tc)]}$
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Because the lemmas above are so important, let's explore them more
		explicitly in words. The first lemma: If ${a}$ divides ${b,}$ and ${a}$
		divides ${c,}$ then ${a}$ divides ${b + c.}$ For example, 2 divides 10 and
		20. Following lemma 1, 2 divides 30.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second lemma: If ${a}$ divides ${b,}$ then ${a}$ divides ${b}$ times
		${c,}$ for any integer ${c.}$ For example, 3 divides 30. It follows that 3
		divides 2(30), or 60.
	</p>
	<p>
		The third lemma: If ${a}$ divides ${b}$ and ${b}$ divides ${c,}$ then ${a}$
		divides ${c.}$ E.g., 2 divides 4, and 4 divides 16. It follows that 2
		divides 16.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, if ${a}$ divides ${b}$ and ${a}$ divides ${c,}$ then ${a}$ divides
		some <span class="term">linear combination</span> ${sb + tc.}$ Example: 3
		divides 6 and 3 divides 9. It follows that 3 divides the linear combination
		${6s + 3t.}$
	</p>

	<h3>Quotients & Remainders</h3>
	<p>
		We know that division sometimes returns a remainder. This phenomenon is
		encapsulated by the <span class="term">division algorithm</span>. The
		division algorithm is not really an algorithm; it's more so a theorem. Its
		formal statement:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem.</span> Suppose ${a \in \Z}$ and ${a, b \in
				\Z^{+}.}$ Then:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\exists q, r \in \Z : (a = dq + r) \land (0 \leq r < d)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, given two integers ${a,}$ and ${d,}$ ${a}$ and ${d}$ can be
		linearly combined into ${a = dq + r,}$ such that ${q}$ and ${r}$ are unique
		integers and ${r}$ is greater than or equal to 0 but less than ${d.}$ This
		is the formal description of what happens in the long division we performed
		in grade school.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the equality ${a = dq + r,}$ ${a}$ is called the
		<span class="term">dividend</span>, ${d}$ is called the
		<span class="term">divisor</span>, and ${r}$ is called the
		<span class="term">remainder</span>. We use the following notation to
		express these ideas:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${q = a \text{ div } d}$</p>
			<p>${r = a \bmod d}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The functions ${\text{ div }}$ and ${\bmod}$ are functions only applicable
		to integers. They are what allow us to compute the quotient and the
		remainder from integer division separately. For example, consider the
		integer ${101.}$ We can express the integer as ${101 = 11 \cdot 9 + 2.}$
		Thus, ${101 \text{ div } 11 = 9,}$ and ${101 \bmod 11 = 2.}$
	</p>
</section>

<section id="modular_arithmetic">
	<h2>Modular Arithmetic</h2>
	<p>
		Imagine a clock displaying the time 9:00A.M. If a friend informs you their
		flight is in 6 hours, what time do we deduce? Well, we would deduce,
		3:00P.M., by simplying adding the 6 hours. However, ${9 + 6 \neq 3.}$ The
		fact that we can determine 3:00 P.M. is 6 hours from 9:00 A.M. goes straight
		to the heart of modular arithmetic.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>9 + 6 = 15. If we used the 24-hour clock, we would quickly determine 3:00
			P.M.</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		What we're actually doing whenever we add or subtract times on a 12-hour
		clock is <span class="italicsText">arithmetic modular 12</span>. In the
		simplest terms, this means that when we get to the number 12, we start the
		count again. The numbers &#8220;wrap around&#8221; like a circle &mdash;
		exactly like a clock. For example, if we instead performed addition with
		<span class="term">arithmetic modular 3</span>, we would go ${1, 2, 3, 1, 2,
		3, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ and so on and so forth. Thus, in arithmetic modular 3,
		${1 + 3 = 1.}$ Pretty cool!
	</p>
	<p>
		How does this tie back to divisibility? Think about the original example,
		${9 + 6 = 3.}$ In normal arithmetic, ${9 + 6 = 15.}$ However, within 15 is a
		single group of 12. The difference between 15 and 12 &mdash; the
		<span class="italicsText">remainder</span> &mdash; is 3. Hence, ${9 + 6 =
		3.}$ Clearly, however, we can't go around saying ${9 + 6 = 3,}$ as most persons do not automatically assume modular arithmetic. We instead must explicitly write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${9 + 6 = 3 \bmod 12}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here are a few other examples (think of a clock to confirm):</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${9 + 25 = 10 \bmod 12}$</p>
			<p>${1 + 17 = 6 \bmod 12}$</p>
			<p>${8 + 29 = 1 \bmod 12}$</p>
			<p>${11 + 43 = 5 \bmod 12}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="jug">
	<h3>Proving Our Motivating Problem</h3>
	<p>
		Using this idea, <span class="term">divisibility</span>, we revisit the
		jug-filling problem with more formality. First, let's state our assumptions:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>
					There is an ${a-}$gallon jug (in the original jug-filling game, ${a =
					3.}$)
				</li>
				<li>
					Suppose further there is a ${b-}$gallon jug (in the original, ${b =
					5}$)
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Now let's state our hypothesis:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m}$
				should divide any result from pouring, emptying, and filling the jugs.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		To prove (or disprove) this hypothesis, we employ a new proving tool. Here,
		we want to think of <span class="term">modeling</span> this problem. By
		modeling, we mean outlining the possible
		<span class="term">states</span> the problem can take. A
		<span class="term">state</span> is simply the set of all current facts in a
		problem. This is fairly vague and abstract, so let's apply the tool. In our
		problem, we have several states. First, we have the numbers of gallons in
		the two jugs. We can denote these numbers with ordered pairs:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>${(x, y) \coloneqq}$ the numbers of gallons in the two jugs</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class="def">
				<li class="where">
					${x \coloneqq}$ the number of gallons in the ${a-}$jug, and
				</li>
				<li>${y \coloneqq}$ the number of gallons in the ${b-}$jug.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>We can also define the start state:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>
					In the start state, there is nothing in each of the jugs. Thus, in the
					start state, the numbers of gallons in the two jugs is ${(0,0).}$
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		These look like a sufficient number of states, and we can't really think of
		anything more useful.
		<span class="marginnote"
			>When writing proofs, it's often best to write out what comes to mind, and
			if we can't think of anything else immediately, simply move to another
			thought.</span
		>
		Let's now think about the <span class="term">transitions</span> &mdash; the
		set of all possible ways we can move from one state to another. One
		transition is emptying a jug:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>If we empty the ${a-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (0, y)}$</li>
				<li>If we empty the ${b-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (x, 0)}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>Another transition is filling.</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>If we fill the ${a-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (a, y).}$</li>
				<li>If we fill the ${b-}$jug, then: ${(x, y) \to (x, b).}$</li>
			</ol>
			<ul class="def">
				<li class="where">${a > x}$ and ${b > y.}$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Finally, we have pouring. This is a somewhat more complex transition. Let's
		first start with ${(x, y).}$ Let's consider the possibilities. One
		possibility is pouring all of the gallons in ${a}$ into all of the gallons
		in ${b.}$ Thus:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(x, y) \to (0, x+y) \implies x+y \geq b}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice the caveat we appended to the end, ${x+y \geq b.}$ This is because
		the ${b}$ jug has a finite amount of space for how many gallons it can take.
		For example, if ${b}$ takes only 3 gallons, as was the case in the original
		game, then ${x + y \geq 3.}$ Hence, the possibility ${(x, y) \to (0, x+y)}$
		can occur only if ${x + y}$ is at most ${b.}$ If ${x + y \geq b}$ is false,
		then we can only pour some of the contents in ${a}$ into ${b.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		How do we generalize <span class="italicsText">some</span> gallons? Well,
		thinking about the start state, ${(x, y).}$ The amount of gallons poured
		into ${b}$ is ${y.}$ This means that the amount of gallons poured from ${a}$
		into ${b}$ such that ${b}$ is completely filled is ${b - y.}$ Accordingly:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${(x, y) \to (x - (b - y), b) = (x + y - b, b) \implies x + y \leq b}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The caveat in this possibility is ${x + y \leq b.}$ This is the
		complementary of the previous caveat. We are within the realm of this
		possibility only if there are enough gallons in ${b}$ to pour into ${a.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		By symmetry, we can list the reverse &mdash; pouring the gallons in ${b}$
		into ${a:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(x, y) \to (x + y, 0) \implies x + y \leq 0}$</p>
			<p>
				${(x, y) \to (a, y - (a - x)) = (a, x + y - a) \implies x + y \leq a}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Thus, we now have all the possibilities of pouring:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ol class="numd">
			<li>${(x, y) \to (0, x+y) \implies x+y \geq b}$</li>
			<li>
				${(x, y) \to (x - (b - y), b) = (x + y - b, b) \implies x + y \leq b}$
			</li>
			<li>${(x, y) \to (x + y, 0) \implies x + y \leq 0}$</li>
			<li>
				${(x, y) \to (a, y - (a - x)) = (a, x + y - a) \implies x + y \leq a}$
			</li>
		</ol>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's ensure the propositions we drew above fully describe the original
		game.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have two jugs that can only store a finite amount of gallons: ${a = 3}$
		and ${b = 5.}$ Suppose the current number of gallons in the jug is
		represented with ${(x, y),}$ where ${x}$ is the number of gallons in the
		${a}$ jug, and ${y}$ is the number of gallons in the ${b}$ jug. At the very
		start, the jugs are empty: ${(x, y) = (0,0).}$
	</p>
	<p>Then, we fill up the ${b}$ jug:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(0, 0) \to (0, 5)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We then pour as much of the gallons in the ${b}$ jug into the ${a}$ jug:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(0, 5) \to (3, 2).}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Next, we emptied the ${a}$ jug:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(3, 2) \to (0, 2)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Then we poured all of the ${b}$ jug into the ${a}$ jug:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(0, 2) \to (2, 0)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Then we filled the ${b}$ jug:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(2, 0) \to (2, 5)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>After which we poured as much as we would to the ${a}$ jug:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(2, 5) \to (3, 4)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Given that our state machine accurately describes the original game, we can
		now prove our hypothesis:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m}$
				should divide any result from pouring, emptying, and filling the jugs.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>To construct this proof, we first define an invariant:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				${P(n) \coloneqq}$ If ${(x, y)}$ is the state after ${n}$ transitions,
				then ${m \space\vert\space x}$ and ${m \space\vert\space y.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now we construct the base case. Here, we want to recall the definition of
		divisiblity. ${m \space\vert\space a}$ is true iff there exists an integer
		${k}$ such that ${a = (k)(m).}$ In this case, the start state, ${(x, y) =
		(0,0)}$ complies with our invariant, since ${m}$ divides ${0.}$ Thus, our
		base case:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${P(0) \coloneqq (0,0) \implies m \space\vert\space 0}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We know that ${m \space\vert\space 0}$ is true for all integers, so the base
		case, ${P(0)}$ is true. Now we perform the inductive step. Assume ${P(n)}$
		is true. We now want to prove that ${P(n + 1)}$ is true. This amounts to
		proving, if we move from ${n,}$ a state, to the next state, ${n + 1,}$ the
		property ${m \space\vert\space x}$ and ${m \space\vert\space y}$ is true.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose ${(x,y)}$ is the state after ${n}$ transitions. Since we suppose
		that ${P(n)}$ is true, we know that ${m \space\vert\space x}$ and ${m
		\space\vert\space y}$ after ${n}$ transitions. Now, we that after a
		transition, we have the following possibilities:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul>
			<li>${(x, y) \to (0, x+y) \implies x+y \geq b}$</li>
			<li>
				${(x, y) \to (x - (b - y), b) = (x + y - b, b) \implies x + y \leq b}$
			</li>
			<li>${(x, y) \to (x + y, 0) \implies x + y \leq 0}$</li>
			<li>
				${(x, y) \to (a, y - (a - x)) = (a, x + y - a) \implies x + y \leq a}$
			</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>
		More generally, after a transition, each of the jugs are either empty (0),
		both jugs are empty (${x}$ and ${y}$), completely filled (${a}$ or ${b}$),
		or partially filled (${x + y - b,}$ or ${x + y - a}$). Now, we also know the
		following: ${m \space\vert\space 0}$ (by definition), ${m \space\vert\space
		a}$ (from our base case) and ${m \space\vert\space b}$ (also from our base
		case). We also know that ${m \space\vert\space x}$ (by ${P(n)}$) and ${m
		\space\vert\space y}$ (also from ${P(n)}$). Because ${a,}$ ${b,}$ ${x,}$ and
		${y}$ are all divisible by ${m,}$ it follows that the linear combinations
		${x + y,}$ ${x + y - a,}$ and ${x + y - b}$ are all divisible by ${m.}$ This
		fact implies that ${m}$ divides any of the possibilities stated above. This
		completes the proof.

<section id="gcd">
	<h2>Greatest Common Divisor</h2>
	<p>
		The <span class="term">GCD</span> (greatest common divisor) of numbers ${a}$
		and ${b}$ is the largest number that divides
		<span class="underlineText">both</span> ${a}$ and ${b.}$ For example,
		${gcd(10, 5) = 2.}$ Similarly, ${gcd(18, 12) = 6.}$ With 18 and 12, 3 is a
		<span class="italicsText">common divisor</span>, but it is not the
		<span class="italicsText">greatest</span> common divisor.
	</p>
	<p>
		What is ${gcd(5, 2)?}$ The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, and the only
		divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Accordingly, ${gcd(5, 2) = 1.}$ When the greatest
		common divisor of two numbers is 1, we say that the numbers are
		<span class="term">relatively prime</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall the theorem we proved above: If ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m
		\space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m \space\vert\space \text{ any result}.}$ The
		corollary to this theorem is that the GCD of ${a}$ and ${b}$ divides any
		result of our state machine (the jug game).
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's prove the corollary: Any linear combination, or state, of ${a}$ and
		${b,}$ where the linear combination is ${L = sa + tb}$ and ${0 \leq L \leq
		b,}$ can be reached. For example, if ${s = -2}$ and ${t = 2,}$ then ${L =
		-2(3) + 2(5) = 4.}$ 4 is a linear combination of ${a}$ and ${b,}$ and we can
		reach that state through ${n}$ transitions.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we prove the corollary above, we will want to keep ${s}$ and ${t}$
		positive (largely because negative integers can be unwieldy). To keep the
		numbers positive, we just have to play around with some natural numbers. For
		example, the linear combination ${L = 4}$ can be constructed with ${L =
		(-2)(3) + (5)(3) + (2)(5) - (3)(5) = (3)(3) - (1)(5) = 4.}$
	</p>

		Let's formalize this trick. Currently, ${L = sa + tb.}$ We can rewrite this
		as ${L = (s + mb)a + (t - ma)b.}$ We can then choose an ${m}$ such that ${m
		> 0.}$ This proves to us that there exists an ${s'}$ and a ${t'}$ such that
		L can be rewritten as ${L = s'a + t'b}$ where ${s' > 0.}$ Knowing this fact,
		we can write an algorithm that solves the jug problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		Assume ${0 < L < b.}$ The algorithm will repeatedly fill and pour jugs: To
		obtain ${L_{gallons},}$ we repeat ${s'}$ times the following steps:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fill the ${a}$ jug.</li>
		<li>Pour the ${a}$ jug into the ${b}$ jug.</li>
		<li>When the ${b}$ jug is full, empty the ${b}$ jug.</li>
		<li>Continue pouring the ${a}$ jug until the ${a}$ jug is empty.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>
		To see that this works, consider obtaining the 4 gallons. We want the linear
		combination ${L = (3)(3) - (1)(5).}$ Accordingly, we must repeat the process
		3 times.

		Let's prove that this algorithm is correct (i.e., prove the corollary). We
		know that we must fill the ${a}$ jug ${s'}$ times. Suppose that the ${b}$
		jug is emptied ${u}$ times. We do not know how many times we have to empty
		the ${b}$ jug, but we will denote it with ${u.}$ Next, let ${r}$ be the
		remainder in the ${b}$ jug.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that ${0 \leq r \leq b,}$ since ${r}$ is what is left in the ${b}$
		jug. Furthermore, we know that ${r = s' \cdot a - u \cdot b.}$ Now, we
		assumed that ${0 < L < b.}$ We also know that ${L = s'a + t'b.}$ Thus, we
		want to show that ${r = L.}$ Hence:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} r &= \overbrace{s'a + t'b}^{L} - t'b - ub \\ &= L - (t'
			- u)b \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What exactly does ${L - (t' - u)b}$ imply? Well, if ${t' + u \neq 0,}$ then
		${r < 0}$ or ${r > b.}$ Now, it cannot be true that ${[r < 0 \lor r > b],}$
		since ${0 \leq r \leq b.}$ Because ${[r < 0 \lor r > b],}$ it must be the
		case that ${t' + u = 0.}$ Hence, ${u = t'.}$ Because of this fact, ${r =
		L.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		The fact that ${r = L}$ leads to a big conclusion. If ${L = 1,}$ we can
		express ${L}$ as ${L = 1 = (2)(3) - (1)(5).}$ This means that using our
		algorithm above, we can reach any ${L}$ that is a multiple of 1. This result
		is generalized through <span class="term">Euclid's algorithm.</span>

	<h2>Euclid's Algorithm</h2>
	<p>
		To understand <span class="italicsText">Euclid's algorithm</span>, we begin
		with the following proposition:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem.</span> There exists a unique ${q,}$ (a
				quotient), and ${r}$ (a remainder), such that ${b = qa + r.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We will denote ${r,}$ the remainder, with ${rem(b, a).}$ With this theorem,
		we can prove the following lemma:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> The greatest common denominator of
				${a}$ and ${b}$ is the greatest common denominator of the remainder of
				${b}$ and ${a}$ and ${a.}$ I.e.,
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${gcd(a, b) = gcd(rem(b, a), a)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>For example, consider the integers 105 and 224. Following the lemma:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{aligned} gcd(105, 224) &= gcd(rem(224, 105), 105) \\ &= gcd(14,
		105) \\ &= gcd(rem(105, 14), 14) \\ &= gcd(7, 14) \\ &= gcd(rem(14, 7), 7)
		\\ &= gcd(0, 7) \\ &= 7 \end{aligned} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		Applying the lemma repeatedly, as we did above, is called Euclid's
		algorithm. To prove the lemma, we want to show that if ${m \space\vert\space
		a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m \space\vert\space rem(b,a)}$ and
		${m \space\vert\space a.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose ${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b.}$ Then it
		must be true that ${m \space\vert\space b - qa}$ and ${m \space\vert\space
		a.}$ Now we know that ${b - qa = rem(b, a),}$ so it must be the case that
		${m \space\vert\space rem(b, a).}$ This proves that ${gcd(a, b)
		\space\vert\space gcd(rem(b,a), a).}$ In turn, this implies that ${gcd(a, b)
		\leq gcd(rem(b,a), a).}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's now consider the cases. First case: If ${rem(b, a) \neq 0,}$ then ${[m
		\space\vert\space rem(b - a) = b - qa \land m \space\vert\space a] \implies
		[m \space\vert\space a \land m \space\vert\space b.]}$ This is because if
		${m \space\vert\space a}$ and ${m \space\vert\space b,}$ then ${m}$ divides
		any linear combination of ${a}$ and ${b.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Second case: If ${rem(b, a) = 0,}$ then ${b - qa = 0.}$ We can rewrite ${b -
		qa = 0}$ as ${b = qa.}$ Thus, if ${rem(b, a) = 0,}$ then ${b = qa.}$ Hence,
		if ${m \space\vert\space a,}$ then ${m \space\vert\space b.}$
