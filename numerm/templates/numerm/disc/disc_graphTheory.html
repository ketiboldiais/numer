<section id="introduction">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">G</span>raph theory is a tremendously important field in
		computer science. If we've ever wondered how Facebook can suggest friends so
		well (almost eerily well), it's because of graph theory. Managing traffic,
		creating family trees, scheduling events, tracing historical origins, the
		mess of yarn, photos, and notes on an investigator's board &mdash; that's
		graph theory.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a problem sociologists and media outlets like Buzzfeed seem to obsess
		over:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				On average, who has more opposite-gender sexual partners &mdash; men or
				women?
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To simplify the mathematics behind this problem (not to make a political
		statement), we'll suppose that there are only two genders: men and women. If
		we read through most of the literature, we'd find that the dominant
		conclusion is that men have more opposite-gender sexual partners than women.
		This is done through numerous, meticulous studies. Some go so far as to
		monitor subject surveys for years. And yet still, the question resurges
		every so often. As long as it sells, we suppose.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematically, however, the question is a non-starter. To see why, we begin
		by stating a few definitions in graph theory.

	<h2>What is a graph?</h2>
	<p>Informally, a graph is just a bunch of dots and lines:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/graph1.svg' %}"
			alt="A graph with 5 notes and 8 edges"
			class="twenty-p"

		<figcaption>A graph with 5 vertices and 8 edges.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A graph is an object consisting of two objects: vertices and edges. Each of
		the circles, or points, is called a <span class="term">vertex</span>, or
		<span class="term">node</span> (we will use the term vertex; plural
		<span class="italicsText">vertices</span>). Each of the lines connecting the
		circles is called an <span class="term">edge</span>. The graph above is
		called a <span class="term">simple graph</span>. We will elaborate further
		on what this distinction means in later sections. For now, we will say that
		a simple graph has the following constraints:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<ol>
				<li>
					An edge connects
					<span class="underlineText">only</span> a
					<span class="italicsText">pair</span> of vertices. For example, in a
					simple graph, we cannot have an edge connecting ${v_4}$ to itself;
					i.e., a loop.
				</li>
				<li>
					We cannot we have more than one edge connect two vertices. I.e., two
					edges connecting ${v_3}$ and ${v_5.}$
				</li>
				<li>
					Edges have no direction; i.e., the fact that ${v_4}$ and ${v_1}$ are
					connected by the edge ${e_4}$ does not imply that the edge goes from
					${v_4}$ to ${v_1}$ or vice versa.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Having said all this, we now state our first definition formally:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition: Graph.</span> A graph, denoted ${G,}$ is
				an non-empty ordered pair ${(V, E).}$ I.e., ${G = (E, V).}$ The first
				element of the pair, ${V,}$ is the set of
				<span class="italicsText">vertices</span>, or
				<span class="italicsText">nodes</span>, of ${G.}$ The second element of
				the pair, ${E,}$ is the set of <span class="italicsText">edges</span> of
				${G.}$ Each edge has 1 or 2 vertices associated with it, called the
				edge's <span class="italicsText">endpoints</span>. An edge
				<span class="italicsText">connects</span> its endpoints.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Note that in the definition above, we specified that the ordered pair must
		be non-empty. We place this condition to simplify many of the theorems we
		will explore. In later sections, we'll consider how the special case of the
		empty graph changes our theorems. For now, assume that all graphs are
		non-empty. That said, let's apply the definition above to another simple
		graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/graph2.svg' %}"
			alt="4 nodes, 4 edges"
			width="100vw"
			height="100vw"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
		<figcaption>Graph ${H}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The graph above, ${H,}$ consists of 4 vertices and 4 edges. The vertices are
		denoted:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${V = \{ v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>And the edges:</p>
	<div>
		$$ \begin{aligned} E &= \{ e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4 \} \\[1em] &= \{ \{ v_1, v_2
		\}, \{ v_2, v_3 \}, \{ v_3, v_4 \}, \{ v_4, v_1 \} \} \end{aligned} $$
	</div>
	<p>
		Now, just because the graph is non-empty does not imply that the graph must
		have edges. For our purposes, it's perfectly fine to have graphs with no
		edges. For example, here's a graph with no edges:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/no_edge_graph.svg' %}"
			alt="no edge graph"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>The graph ${M}$</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>The graph above consists of vertices, but no edges:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${V = \{ v_1, v_2, v_3 \}}$</p>
			<p>${E = \varnothing}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>If there are edges, however, we have the following definition:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition: Adjacent Nodes.</span> Two nodes ${v_i}$
				and ${v_j}$ are <span class="term">adjacent</span> if ${\{ x_i, x_j \}
				\in E.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, if the nodes ${v_i}$ and ${v_j}$ are connected with an edge,
		we say that ${v_i}$ and ${v_j}$ are adjacent. For example, these two nodes
		are adjacent:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/adjacent_nodes.svg' %}"
			alt="adjacent nodes"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>
			Some nodes are adjacent, others are not. Notice that we can name nodes
			however way we'd like.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In the graph above, the nodes ${x_1}$ and ${x_2}$ are adjacent. The nodes
		${x_2}$ and ${x_3}$ are adjacent, but ${x_1}$ and ${x_3}$ are not. Closely
		related to adjacency is <span class="term">incidence</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition: Incidence.</span> An edge ${e = \{ v_i,
				v_j \}}$ is <span class="term">incident</span> to its
				<span class="term">endpoints</span> ${v_i}$ and ${v_j.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, in the graph below, the edge ${e_1}$ is incident to ${n_1}$ and
		${n_3:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/incidence.svg' %}"
			alt="incident nodes"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>Incidence depends on the edge in consideration</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		With the definition of incidence, we can talk about the
		<span class="term">degrees</span> of a node:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition: Degree of a Node.</span> The number of
				edges incident to a node is the <span class="term">degree</span> of a
				node.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, the node ${p_6}$ in the graph below has a degree of ${5.}$ All
		the other nodes have a degree of ${1.}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/degree_of_a_node.svg' %}"
			alt="degree of a node"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>A graph with different degrees.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Next, recall that we first stated that we will only consider simple graphs.
		The formal definition for a simple graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A graph is
				<span class="term">simple</span> if it has no loops or multiple edges.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, the graphs below are not simple graphs. Graph ${A}$ contains a loop,
		and graph ${B}$ contains multiple edges:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/non_simple_graph.svg' %}"
			alt="non-simple graphs"
			loading="lazy"
			class="forty-p"
		/>
		<figcaption>${A}$ contains a loop, and ${B}$ has multiple edges</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A loop is simply an edge that connects a node to itself, and a multiple
		edge, also called a <span class="term">multiedge</span>, is an edge that
		consists of edges that are really the same (connecting the same points).
	</p>
	<p>
		Returning to our Buzzfeed question, we can find an answer with the
		definitions we have so far. First, let's say the total population in the
		United States is ${V.}$ We'll think of this as the set of all nodes. In the
		United States, there are roughly ${300~000~000}$ people. Thus, ${n(V)
		\approx 300~000~000.}$ Within the set ${V,}$ we have two subsets: ${V_m}$
		(the number of men) and ${V_w}$ (the number of women). There are roughly
		${147~600~000}$ men. And the number of women is roughly ${152~400~000.}$
		Thus, we have:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${n(V_m) \approx 147~600~000}$</p>
			<p>${n(V_w) \approx 152~400~000}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, we don't know the size of the set ${E}$ (the set of all edges). But, if
		we represented each edge as a sexual relationship between a node in ${V_m}$
		to a node in ${V_w,}$ the degree of each node is the number of sexual
		partners for that particular node. Thus, what we're really looking for is
		the ratio between the average degree for a node in ${V_m,}$ and the average
		degree for a node in ${V_w.}$ Let's denote the variables:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				Let ${A_m}$ be the average number of opposite-gender partners for men.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let ${A_w}$ be the average number of opposite-gender partners for women.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The question then, is, what is the value of this expression:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\dfrac{A_m}{A_w}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To find ${A_m,}$ we can just sum all of the degrees, and divide by the
		number of nodes:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A_m = \dfrac{\sum\limits^{x \in V_m} \text{deg}(n)}{n(V_m)}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The sum in the expression is a bit too complicated to look at. Can we
		simplify it? Sure. Since there are only opposite gender partners, all of the
		edges appear once, and only once, when we're counting all of the degrees.
		Thus, summing all of the degrees is just summing all of the edges:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A_m = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(V_m)}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The same analysis applies for computing ${A_w:}$</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A_w = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(V_w)}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Plugging these quantities into the original expression:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{A_m}{A_w} &=
			\dfrac{\dfrac{n(E)}{n(V_m)}}{\dfrac{n(E)}{n(V_w)}} \\[2em] &=
			\dfrac{n(V_w)}{n(V_m)} \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Now that's interesting. Using the population estimates, we have:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} \dfrac{A_m}{A_w} &= \dfrac{n(V_w)}{n(V_m)} \\[1em]
			&\approx \dfrac{152~400~000}{147~600~000} \\[1em] &\approx 1.0325
			\end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Based on a purely mathematical analysis, men have roughly 3% more opposite
		sex partners then women. We didn't need any survey, years of research, or
		thousands of dollars in funding. Moreover, it has nothing to do with whether
		men are more promiscuous than women, or some theory of the modern
		patriarchy. It all came down to the simple fact that there are more women
		than men in the United States.
	</p>
	<p>
		Questions of this variety plague current literature. They appear in a
		variety of mutations: Why do minority students, on average, study more with
		non-minority students? Why are atheists, on average, more likely to marry
		non-atheists rather than atheists? Why are white men more likely to marry
		East Asian women?

	<h2>Graph Theory & Scheduling</h2>
	<p>
		With the previous example, we used an edge to analyze the
		<span class="term">affinity</span> between two nodes &mdash; the nodes have
		some sort of connection, or attraction, to one another. We can, however,
		also use graphs to analyze <span class="term">aversion</span> between two
		nodes &mdash; the nodes cannot be near one another. Aversion is precisely
		what we use to solve scheduling problems. For example, consider the issue of
		scheduling final exams at a college. The goal is to ensure that no students
		take two exams at the same time (or to minimize the possibility of that
		event occurring). Suppose the college had five classes:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>BIO100 (denoted ${b}$), and</li>
		<li>CS100 (denoted ${c}$),</li>
		<li>HIST100 (denoted ${h}$).</li>
		<li>MATH100 (denoted ${m}$),</li>
		<li>PHYS100 (denoted ${p}$),</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now let's say we have the following data:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There are students enrolled in both BIO100 and CS100.</li>
		<li>There are students enrolled in both BIO100 and MATH100.</li>
		<li>There are students enrolled in both CS100 and PHYS100.</li>
		<li>There are students enrolled in both CS100 and MATH100.</li>
		<li>There are students enrolled in both PHYS100 and MATH100.</li>
		<li>There are students enrolled in both PHYS100 and HIST100.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We can represent the data above with a graph:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/scheduling.svg' %}"
			alt="scheduling"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From the graph above, we can easily see where exams can't be scheduled. For
		example, with CS100, we cannot schedule an exam at the same time as BIO100,
		MATH100, or PHYS100. But, we can have the CS100 exam at the same time as
		HIST100.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now let's say we have the following time slots for the exam, all on a
		Wednesday:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>12:00 - 2:00pm, denoted ${c_1,}$</li>
		<li>2:00 - 4:00pm, denoted ${c_2,}$</li>
		<li>4:00 - 6:00pm, denoted ${c_3,}$</li>
		<li>6:00 - 8:00pm, denoted ${c_4,}$</li>
		<li>8:00 - 10:00pm, denoted ${c_5}$</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Our job is to ensure we don't use the late exam slots. The goal is to assign
		one of the time slots above such that nodes connected by an edge do not get
		the same time slot. This is called a
		<span class="term">graph coloring problem</span>:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Problem: Graph Coloring.</span> Given a graph ${G}$
				and ${k}$ colors, assign a color to each node such that adjacent nodes
				get different colors.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The minimum number of colors we need is called the
		<span class="term">chromatic number</span> of the graph:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition: Chromatic Number.</span> The minimum
				number of colors that solves a graph coloring problem is the
				<span class="italicsText">chromatic number</span> of the graph ${G,}$
				denoted ${\Chi (G).}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In our problem, a &#8220;color&#8221; is a time slot. Clearly, we can get
		away with ${5}$ colors:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/scheduling1.svg' %}"
			alt="scheduling"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		But, we want to avoid the later time slots as much as we can. It looks like
		we can manage with ${4}$ colors:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/scheduling2.svg' %}"
			alt="scheduling"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>How about ${3}$ colors? A little trickier, but yes, we can:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/scheduling3.svg' %}"
			alt="scheduling"
			loading="lazy"
			class="twenty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now here's the real challenge: Can we do it in ${2?}$ Unfortunately, no. It
		cannot be done. This is because the nodes ${c,}$ ${b,}$ and ${m}$ have edges
		connecting all through of them. Thus, we need, at a minimum, three colors.
		Thus, we can conclude that ${3}$ is the chromatic number. It's the best we
		can do.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, solving graph coloring problems is unbelievably difficult. In
		fact, there is currently no known algorithm for finding chromatic numbers.
		The unusual characteristic of graph coloring problems is that they're very
		easy to verify solutions for, but it's tremendously difficult to find those
		solutions (essentially, trying an exponential number of possibilities).
	</p>
	<p>
		Graph coloring problems are members of a class of problems called
		<span class="term">NP-complete problems</span>. There are roughly a thousand
		such problems, and they all have the characteristic of being easy to verify,
		but difficult to find, solutions for. Even more peculiar, solving just one
		of the NP complete problems solves the rest of the problems (or,
		alternatively, proving that no solution exists for just one problem proves
		that no solution exists for all of the problems). These problems are not
		purely academic. Software producers run into NP-complete problems repeatedly
		in development, and firms spend a significant amount of money searching for
		solutions or mitigating costs.
	</p>
	<section id="basic_coloring_algorithm">
		<h3>Basic Coloring Algorithm</h3>
		<p>
			Although there is no algorithm that completely solves a graph coloring
			problem, there are algorithms that can get us close. Here's a basic one:
		</p>
		<ol class="recipe">
			<li>Order the nodes ${v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n.}$</li>
			<li>Order the colors ${c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n.}$</li>
			<li>For ${i = 1, 2, \ldots, n:}$</li>
			<ol>
				<li>If ${v_i}$ has no adjacent nodes, assign the lowest color.</li>
				<li>Otherwise, if ${v_i}$ has adjacent nodes:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Among the adjacent nodes, determine the lowest color assigned. Call
						it ${c_{\ell}.}$
					</li>
					<li>
						Among the adjacent nodes, determine the highest color assigned. Call
						it ${c_{h}.}$
					</li>
					<li>If there is a ${c_i < c_{\ell},}$ assign ${c_i}$ to ${v_i.}$</li>
					<li>
						If there is no color lower, assign the color ${c_{h + 1}}$ to
						${v_i.}$
					</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Increment ${i.}$</li>
				<li>If ${i \leq n,}$ return to step ${3.}$</li>
				<li>
					Otherwise, if ${i > n,}$ return the pairings of ${v_n}$ and ${c_n.}$
				</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
		<p>
			We call this algorithm the
			<span class="term">basic coloring algorithm</span>. It's an example of a
			<span class="term">greedy algorithm</span> &mdash; an algorith that
			attempts to accomplish the best result at each step, always moving
			forward. With greedy algorithms, there is no notion of &#8220;going
			back&#8221; and redoing a computation in light of new findings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Examining the basic coloring algorithm, we can likely tell it works well
			if all of the nodes have a low degree. For example, with the exam
			scheduling problem, the highest degree was three, and we got away with
			four colors. Better yet, we got away with three colors. Because of this
			result, we can suspect that if the maximum degree in the graph is some
			natural number ${d,}$ we would need, at most, one extra color. Let's state
			this suspicion as a hypothesis and determine if it's true or false via
			proof:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Hypothesis.</span>
					If every node in a graph ${G}$ has a degree less than or equal to
					${d,}$ then the basic coloring algorithm uses at most ${d + 1}$
					colors.
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			If our hunch is true, then we'd have an extremely useful insight: If the
			graph contains thousands, or even billions of nodes, and the maximum
			degree is three, we would only need four colors.
		</p>
		<p>
			To prove the proposition above, we will perform a proof-by-induction. As
			such, we need an inductive hypothesis. We could induct on ${d,}$ but the
			problem with doing so is that it's not entirely clear how we would use
			${d,}$ and how it relates to the number of nodes and edges. A better
			starting point is to consider ${n,}$ where ${n}$ is the number of graphs
			in the node. As such, our inductive hypothesis is a restatement of our
			original hypothesis:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Inductive Hypothesis.</span>
					If every node in an ${n}$-node graph ${G}$ has a degree less than or
					equal to ${d,}$ then the basic coloring algorithm uses at most ${d +
					1}$ colors.
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			We can now refer to our inductive hypothesis as ${P(n).}$ With graphs,
			it's almost always the case that we should start by consider ${n,}$ where
			${n}$ is the number of nodes. If that doesn't work, we should consider
			${n(E)}$ where ${n(E)}$ is the number of edges. And only when these two
			approaches don't work do we consider ${d,}$ the degree of each node.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we need a base case. Since we don't have any notion of graphs with no
			nodes, we consider the next simplest case: ${n = 1.}$ If ${n = 1}$ (a
			graph with only one node), then the number of edges is zero (since we
			don't allow loops). Thus, since ${d = 0,}$ we use at most ${d + 1 = 0 + 1
			= 1}$ colors. So we know our base case, ${P(1),}$ is true. For an
			${n}$-node graph where ${n = 1,}$ the basic coloring algorithm uses at
			most ${d + 1}$ colors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we perform the inductive step: Assume ${P(n)}$ is true for the sake of
			induction &mdash; proving that ${P(n) \implies P(n + 1).}$ With that
			assumption, we consider the ${P(n + 1)}$ proposition. ${P(n) \implies P(n
			+ 1)}$ is always true if ${P(n + 1)}$ cannot be false.
		</p>
		<p>
			With ${P(n + 1),}$ we're considering the graph with ${n + 1}$ nodes.
			Suppose the graph ${G = (V, E)}$ is any ${(n+1)}$-node graph. Suppose
			further that ${d}$ is the maximum degree in ${G.}$ Next, suppose the nodes
			are ordered (in any way):
		</p>

				<p>${\lang v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n, v_{n+1} \rang}$</p>
			</div>

			Now we need to use our induction hypothesis. To do so, we we consider the
			nodes from ${v_1}$ through ${v_n,}$ ignoring ${v_{n+1}}$ momentarily:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>
					${\lang \underbrace{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n,}_{\text{focus}}~v_{n+1}
					\rang}$
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			If we just focus on these nodes, we are really just considering an
			${n}$-node graph. We'll call this graph ${G'.}$
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${G' = (V', E')}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Consider ${G',}$ we observe that removing a node from the graph doesn't
			increase the <span class="underlineText">maximum</span> degree of ${G'.}$
			Removing a node doesn't cause some node to have a greater degree. Which
			node has the highest degree might change, but the highest degree of ${G'}$
			overall does not increase. It might decrease, but it does not increase.
			Thus, even if we remove a node from the graph ${G',}$ the maximum degree
			of ${G'}$ remains ${d.}$ Thus, for the ${n}$-node graph, ${P(n)}$ is true
			because ${d}$ doesn't increase &mdash; given an ${n}$-node graph, the
			basic coloring algorithm, at most, uses ${d + 1}$ colors for ${v_1, v_2,
			\ldots, v_n.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we consider the ${n+1}$-node graph. The node ${v_{n+1},}$ has at most
			${d}$ neighbors<label for="neighbor" class="margin-toggle"
				><sup></sup
			></label>
			<input
				type="checkbox"
				id="neighbor"
				class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
			/>
			<span class="marginnote"
				>A <b>neighbor</b> of a node ${v}$ is a node adjacent to ${v.}$</span
			>
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/node_neighbors.svg' %}"
				alt="node neighbors"
				loading="lazy"
				class="fifteen-p"
			/>
			<figcaption>${v_{n+1}}$ has ${\leq d}$ neighbors.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Given that ${v_{n+1}}$ has at most ${d}$ neighbors, what does this mean in
			terms of the colors we can use? Well, we know that it can't be any one of
			the colors assigned to the neighbors ${u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_d.}$ Thus, we
			can rule out ${d}$ colors. Given that we're working with ${d}$ colors, we
			have:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${(d + 1) - d = 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			color left to use safely. Thus, there is at least one color in the set of
			${d + 1}$ colors unused by any neighbor. That color can be assigned to
			${v_{n+1}.}$ It follows then that the basic algorithm uses, at most, ${d +
			1}$ colors on some graph ${G,}$ which in turn proves that ${P(n+1)}$ is
			true. We've completed the induction:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Theorem.</span>
					If every node in an ${n}$-node graph ${G}$ has a degree less than or
					equal to ${d,}$ then the basic coloring algorithm uses at most ${d +
					1}$ colors.
				</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Importantly, the theorem above only provides an upper bound. It says
			nothing about whether we can get away with less than ${d + 1.}$ In fact,
			the most obvious example of a graph where we can do better than ${d + 1}$
			is a <b>star graph</b>:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/star_graph.svg' %}"
				alt="star graph"
				loading="lazy"
				class="ten-p"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>A more complicated example:</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/bipartite-graph-1.svg' %}"
				alt="bipartite graph"
				loading="lazy"
				class="fifteen-p"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Notice that red node connects to each yellow node other than the node
			directly across from it. Because of this property, we can get away with
			two colors, red and yellow. This only works, however, if we used the right
			ordering:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/bipartite-graph-2.svg' %}"
				alt="bipartite graph"
				loading="lazy"
				class="twenty-p"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>Had we used another ordering, we'd be in trouble:</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/bipartite-graph-2.svg' %}"
				alt="bipartite graph"
				loading="lazy"
				class="twenty-p"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The graphs above are called <b>bipartite graphs</b>. The formal
			definition:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>
					<span class="topic">Definition: Bipartite Graph.</span> A graph ${G =
					(V, E)}$ is a bipartite graph iff the vertices ${V}$ can be
					partitioned (i.e., split) into two sets, ${V_\ell}$ (the left set) and
					${V_r}$ (the right set), so that all the edges connect a node in
					${V_\ell}$ to a node in ${V_r.}$
