	<h3>Counting</h3>
	<p>
		In these next few sections, we explore the basics of
		<span class="italicsText">counting</span>. The concept of counting might
		seem intuitive, but looks can be deceiving. Many counting problems require
		us to first determine (a) <span class="italicsText">what</span> exactly it
		is we are counting, and (b) <span class="italicsText">how</span> we should
		count. It is these problems that concern the next sections.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before we begin counting, however, we must revisit some aspects of basic set
		theory. Like many other areas of mathematics, counting depends heavily on
		set theoretic foundations.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="set_theory_counting" class="grid-item">
	<h4>Basic Set Theory</h4>
	<p>
		A <span class="term">set</span> is simply a collection of
		<span class="italicsText">distinct</span> objects. For example, ${\{ 1, 2,
		3, 4, 5 \}}$ is a set. Contrary to what may be taught in high school
		courses, ${\{ 1, 1, 1, 2 \}}$ is a <span class="term">bag</span>, not a set.
		A bag, also called a <span class="italicsText">multiset</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">mset</span>, is a collection of distinct and
		non-distinct objects; i.e., there may be more than one instance of each of
		its elements. We are concerned here primarily with sets.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Set Membership.</span> The objects in a set are called
		that set's members. For example, the set of all whales includes humpback
		whales and blue whales. To denote such membership, we use the symbol
		${\in.}$ In the example above, we would write ${\text{blue whales} \in
		\text{whales}.}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> The set membership symbol ${\in}$
				denotes that an object is a member of a set.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Empty Set.</span>Sets are defined by membership
		rules. All objects that satisfy that rule are members of that set. For
		example, the set of all cats includes Siamese and Persians.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, some membership rules imply that the set contains no members. For
		example, the set of all immortal humans. Setting aside questions of the
		living dead, this set contains no members, for all humans are mortal (at
		least as of now). This phenomenon leads to a special kind of set &mdash; the
		<span class="term">empty set</span>, or the set containing no objects.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> The
				<span class="italicsText">empty set</span> is the set containing no
				objects. We denote it with ${\{ \}}$ or with the
				<span class="italicsText">null</span> symbol, ${\emptyset.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equality of Sets.</span> Suppose ${A}$ is the set ${\{
		1, 2, 3 \}}$ and ${B}$ is the set ${\{ 1, 2, 3 \}.}$ Because ${A}$ and ${B}$
		have the exact same members, we say that they are
		<span class="italicsText">equal</span>.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Two sets are equal if they have
				exactly the same members.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Similarly, ${\{ 4 5 6 \}}$ and ${\{ 6 4 5 \}}$ are equal sets. Why? Because
		the definition of a set imposes no requirement of order. A set is simply a
		collection of distinct objects &mdash; nothing more.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Thought.</span> Consider the two sets below:</p>

	<h4>Counting &amp; Arithmetic</h4>
	<p>How many numbers are in this sequence:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Clearly, there are 10 numbers. This is a very basic counting problem, and it
		is what we think of when hear the word &#8220;counting&#8221;. Now, how many
		numbers are between 8 and 16 inclusive (i.e., including 8 and 16)?:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We could manually count each element. But, that approach is inefficient,
		particularly for very long sequences. A better way would be to simplify
		sequence into the one we saw previously:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				$[ (8-7), (9-7), (10-7), (11-7), (12-7), (13-7), (14-7), (15-7), (16-7)
				]$
			</p>

		<div><p>${\text{\textbardbl}}$</p></div>
		<div><p>${[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}$</p></div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		From this approach, we can see that given two positive numbers ${a}$ and
		${b}$ where ${b > a,}$ the number of integers in the sequence ${[a, a+1,
		\ldots, b-1, b]}$ is: ${(b - a) + 1.}$
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Proposition.</span> Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be integers,
			where ${b > a.}$ Given a sequence ${L = [a, a+1, \ldots, b-1, b],}$ the
			number of elements in the sequence, ${n(L),}$ is given by:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${n(L) = (b - a) + 1}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<p>
		We can use the proposition above for even more complex problems. For
		example, how many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, we know the first multiple of three between 62 and 215 is 63. The last
		multiple of three is 213. Thus, the actual array we want to count is ${63,
		66, 69, \ldots, 213.}$ Now, we need to convert this array into one we know
		how to count, so we divide each element in the array by 3: ${21, 22, 23,
		\ldots , 71.}$ From our previous proposition, we know how to count this
		array: ${(71 - 21) + 1 = 51.}$ Thus, there are 51 numbers in the array
		&mdash; i.e., there are 51 multiples of 3 between 62 and 215.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's try another one. How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101?
		Again, the first multiple of 10 is 10. The last multiple of 10 is 100. Thus,
		the sequence is ${[10, 20, \ldots, 100].}$ We divide by 10: ${[1, 2, 3,
		\ldots, 10].}$ And again, we know how to count this sequence: ${(10 - 1) + 1
		= 10.}$ There are 10 multiples of 10 between 9 and 101.
	</p>
	<p>
		How many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103? Here, the first multiple of
		10 is 20. The last multiple of 10 is 100. We have the sequence ${[20, 30,
		\ldots, 100].}$ Dividing by 3: ${[2, 3, 4, \ldots, 10.]}$ Then counting:
		${(10-2) + 1 = 9.}$ There are 9 multiples of 10 between 11 and 103.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that we know how to count multiples, we can start counting even more
		elaborate sequences: How many four-digit positive integers are perfect
		cubes?
	</p>
	<p>
		Solution: We know that the first four-digit positive integer that is a
		perfect cube is ${10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000.}$ The last four-digit perfect
		cube is a bit trickier to find. Fortunately, the method of exhaustion is
		feasible here. We know ${20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 8000.}$ This is already
		pretty close to five-digits, so let's just try the next positive integer:
		${21 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 = 9,261.}$ Now we're very close; 22 will probably
		enter five-digit territory: ${22 \cdot 22 \cdot 22 = 10,648.}$ Great, so we
		know our sequence is ${[1000, \ldots, 9261].}$ Taking the cubic root of each
		element, we have ${[10, \ldots, 21.]}$ Counting this list: ${(21 - 10) + 1 =
		12.}$ Hence, there are 12 four-digit positive integers that are perfect
		cubes.

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many numbers are in the following

				\ldots, 55, 60.]}$ Now let's divide by 5: ${-6, -5, -4, \ldots, 11,

		<details class="answer">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>
				We can see each element differs by ${\frac{2}{3}.}$ Let's try and give

				${\frac{1}{3}}$ out, leaving us with: ${[11, 13, 15, \ldots, 79, 81.]}$
				These are all separated by 2, so let's subtract 1 to each element:
				${[10, 12, 14, \ldots, 78, 80];}$ then divide by 2: ${[5, 6, 7, \ldots,

	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			Again, let's come up with a sequence. First, let's find the first element.
			The first element is 9: ${3^2 = 9.}$ Now let's find the last element. We
			know ${12^2 = 144.}$ So just a little higher. ${13^2 = 169.}$ ${15 \times
			15 = 225;}$ too high. ${14^2 = 196,}$ but this is even. So, the first
			element is 9, and the last element is 169. Thus, we have ${[9, 25, 49, 81,
			\ldots 196].}$ Taking the square root each element: ${[3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots

		<span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many sets of four consecutive
		positive integers are there such that the product of the four integers is
		less than 100,000?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			First, the smallest element in this sequence is ${[1, 2, 3, 4] = 1 \cdot 2
			\cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24}$ (remember, we're looking for consecutive positive
			integers). Now, we have to look for the largest set. Let's focus on the
			value 100,000.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're looking for four numbers that when multiplied together produce
			100,000. Let's look at a simpler case, a number to the power of 4. We know
			that ${20^4 = 160,000.}$ Let's try another number: ${19^4 = 130,321.}$
			Getting a little closer. ${18^4 = 104,976.}$ This is pretty close, so the
			last number has to be immediately next to 18. Let's try another one:
			${17^4 = 83,521.}$ This is lower than 100,000. This means the set of four
			integers is somewhere in the vicinity of 17 and 18. Let's try: ${15 \cdot
			16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 = 73,440.}$ Close, but let's just try one more: ${16
			\cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 = 93,024;}$ include 20 in the next set and we
			are definitely over 100,000. Thus, this is definitely the last element.
			Great, this means we have the following:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${M = [\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \ldots, \{16, 17, 18, 19\}]}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Now, the question is how do we count these? Well, let's think about how
			each of these sets work:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${ \{ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \} }$</p>
				<p>${\vdots}$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \} }$</p>
				<p>${ \{ 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 \} }$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			If we focus on just the first number for each of the sets above, we get:
			${1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 15, 16.}$ Thus, there are 16 different possible
			sets.

<section id="counting_with_addition_and_subtraction" class="grid-item">
	<h4>Counting with Addition and Subtraction</h4>
	<p>
		Counting is deeply intertwined with arithmetic. Consider the following
		problem:
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			12 students are taking at least 1 foreign language. The school offers only
			Spanish and French. 8 students take Spanish, 5 take both Spanish and
			French. How many students take French?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but the worst possible way
		is to blindly add and subtract. We want to think as logically as possible.
		More importantly, we want to think about this problem in terms of set
		theory. Here, we have a situation where students take Spanish, French, or
		both Spanish and French. The problem can be viewed as sets intersecting,
		where ${F = \text{French},}$ ${S = \text{Spanish}:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/french_and_spanish.svg' %}"
			alt="int"
			loading="lazy"
			class="sixty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The Venn diagram above can be thought of as representing several sections:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${F \cup S}$ = {all students}</p>
			<p>${F}$ = {all French students}</p>
			<p>${S}$ = {all Spanish students}</p>
			<p>${F \cap S}$ = {students taking French and Spanish}</p>
			<p>${F \setminus S}$ = {students taking only French}</p>
			<p>${S \setminus F}$ = {students taking only Spanish}</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Here, we are asked to find ${n(F).}$ We have the following data:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(F \cup S) = 12}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 8}$</p>
			<p>${n(F \cap S) = 5}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		What else can we infer from this data? Well, we know that ${n(F \cap S) =
		5.}$ These are the students that take both Spanish and French. Next, we know
		${n(S) = 8;}$ there are 8 total students taking Spanish. Thus, we can make
		the following inference:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \setminus F) = n(S) - n(F \cap S) = 8 - 5 = 3.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Thus, there are 3 students that take only Spanish. How many students take
		only French? Well, it must be 4, since ${n(F \cup S) - n(S) = 12 - 8 = 4.}$
		Hence, ${n(F) = n(F \setminus S) + n(F \cap S) = 4 + 5 = 9.}$
	</p>
	<p>Here is another problem:</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			Agnes has 27 cats. 14 cats are short-haired. 11 cats are kittens. 5 cats
			are long-haired adult cats (not kittens). How many short-haired kittens?
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Again, set theory allows us to think about this as logically as possible.
		Here, we have several sets from the data above:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${S}$ = short-hairs</p>
			<p>${L}$ = long-hairs</p>
			<p>${K}$ = kittens</p>
			<p>${A}$ = adults</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The problem gives us the following data, and the last line is what we want
		to find:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${n(S \cup L) = n(A \cup K)}$ = total cats = 27</p>
			<p>${n(S) = n(K \cup S) + n(A \cup S)}$</p>
			<p>${n(L) = n(K \cup L) + n(A \cup L)}$</p>
			<p>${n(S) = 14}$</p>
			<p>${n(K) = 11}$</p>
			<p>${n(L \cap A) = 5}$</p>
			<p>${n(K \cap S) = ?}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		First, we know that ${n(K \cup A) = 27.}$ We also know that ${n(K) = 11.}$
		Thus, ${n(A) = n(K \cup A) - n(K) = 27 - 11 = 16.}$ There are 16 adults.
	</p>
	<p>
		We know that ${n(L \cap A) = 5,}$ so ${n(A \cap S) = n(A) - n(A \cap L) = 16
		- 5 = 11.}$ There are 11 short-hair adults. Now, we know ${n(S) = 14,}$ and
		we know that ${n(S) = n(K \cap S) + n(A \cap S).}$ Hence, ${n(K \cap S) =
		n(S) - n(A \cap S) = 14 - 11 = 3.}$ Therefore, there are 3 short-hair
		kittens.
