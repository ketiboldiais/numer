<h1>Relations</h1>
<section id="relations">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">A</span>s humans, we perceive the world according to the
		way things relate to one another. Corporate hierarchy, family relationships,
		friend networks, court systems, if-then, if-and-only-if, cause and effect,
		these are all relationships. Mathematical objects are no different &mdash;
		they too have relationships to other mathematical objects. The set $A$ is
		related to the set $B$ if ${ A \subseteq B }$. The number $a$ is related to
		the number $b$ if ${ a < b }$, or if ${ a^2 + b^2 = 1 }$.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematics, a <span class="term">relation</span> is a proposition that
		states how a set of objects relates to another set of objects. For example,
		suppose we have two sets: ${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$ and ${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$.
		Suppose further that an element ${a \in A}$ is related to an element ${b \in
		B}$, if, and only if, ${a < b}$. From this rule, we can infer:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${0 \mathrel{R} 1}$ since ${0 < 1,}$</li>
		<li>${0 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${0 < 3,}$</li>
		<li>${1 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${1 < 2,}$</li>
		<li>${1 \mathrel{R} 3}$, since ${1 < 3,}$</li>
		<li>${2 \mathrel{R} 3}$ since ${2 < 3,}$</li>
		<li>${1 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${1 \nless 1,}$</li>
		<li>${2 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${2 \nless 1,}$ and</li>
		<li>${2 \not\mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${2 \nless 2}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We use the notation ${a \mathrel{R} b}$ to express the proposition ${(a,b)
		\in \space \mathrel{R}}$ and ${a \not\mathrel{R} b}$ to express the
		proposition ${(a, b) \notin \space \mathrel{R}.}$ If ${(a,b) \in \space
		\mathrel{R},}$ we say that
		<span class="underlineText"
			>${a}$ is related to ${b}$ by ${\mathrel{R}.}$</span
		>
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall: Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the
		<span class="italicsText">Cartesian product</span> ${A \times B}$ is the set
		of all ordered pairs ${(x, y)}$ such that ${x \in A}$ and ${y \in B}$. Or,
		more formally:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A \times B = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in A \text{ and } y \in B \}}$.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>So, suppose we had two simple sets:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$</p>
			<p>${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The Cartesian product ${A \times B}$ is:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ A \times B = \left\{ \begin{aligned} & (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), \\ & (1,1),
			(1,2), (1,3), \\ & (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) \end{aligned} \right\} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we know what ordered pairs are members of ${A \times B}$, then we can
		know which elements of $A$ are related to which elements of $B$ and vice
		versa. We use the word &#8220;can&#8221; because relations only exist if
		there is some criteria for defining the relationship. Otherwise, all we
		would have is a set of ordered pairs. For example, consider the following
		set:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${G = \{ \text{Zeus}, \text{Apollo}, \text{Cronus}, \text{Poseidon} \}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The cross product of this set:</p>

	<div>
		$$ \footnotesize G \times G = \left\{ \begin{aligned} & (\text{Zeus},
		\text{Zeus}), (\text{Zeus}, \text{Apollo}), (\text{Zeus}, \text{Cronus}), \\
		& (\text{Zeus}, \text{Poseidon}), (\text{Apollo}, \text{Zeus}),
		(\text{Apollo}, \text{Apollo}), \\ & (\text{Apollo}, \text{Cronus}),
		(\text{Apollo}, \text{Poseidon}), (\text{Cronus}, \text{Zeus}), \\ &
		(\text{Cronus}, \text{Apollo}), (\text{Cronus}, \text{Cronus}),
		(\text{Cronus}, \text{Poseidon}), \\ & (\text{Poseidon}, \text{Zeus}),
		(\text{Poseidon}, \text{Apollo}), (\text{Poseidon}, \text{Cronus}), \\ &
		(\text{Poseidon}, \text{Poseidon}) \end{aligned} \right\} $$
	</div>

	<p>
		If we defined the relation ${\mathrel{F}}$ to be &#8220;is the father
		of&#8221;, we would have a subset of the cross product:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${\mathrel{F}\space = \{ (\text{Zeus},\text{Apollo}),
				(\text{Cronus},\text{Poseidon}), (\text{Cronus},\text{Zeus}) \}}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can then explicitly state the relations as:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul>
			<li>${\text{Zeus}}$ ${\space\mathrel{F}\space}$ ${\text{Apollo}}$</li>
			<li>${\text{Cronus}}$ ${\space\mathrel{F}\space}$ ${\text{Poseidon}}$</li>
			<li>${\text{Cronus}}$ ${\space\mathrel{F}\space}$ ${\text{Zeus}}$</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>We can represent these relations as a table:</p>
	<figure>
		<table class="relation">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${\mathrel{F}}$</td>
					<td>${\text{Z}}$</td>
					<td>${\text{A}}$</td>
					<td>${\text{C}}$</td>
					<td>${\text{P}}$</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${\text{Z}}$</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>

					<td>${\times}$</td>

					<td>${\times}$</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>${\text{P}}$</td>

					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>
	<p>More formally:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. A
				<span class="term">binary relation</span> ${R}$ from ${A}$ to ${B}$ is a
				subset of ${A \times B}$. Or, in set notation:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${A \mathrel{R} B \subseteq A \times B}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From the definition above, we have the following corollary:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Corollary.</span> Given ${(x,y) \in A \times B}$,
				${x}$ is related to ${y}$ by $\mathrel{R,}$ denoted ${x \mathrel{R} y,}$
				if, and only if, ${(x,y) \in \space \mathrel{R}}$.
			</p>
			<p>
				The set ${A}$ is called the <span class="term">domain</span> of ${R}$,
				and the set ${B}$ is called the <span class="term">codomain</span> of
				${R}$.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We denote the domain and codomain of a relation with the notation:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\mathrel{R} : A \mapsto B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${A}$ is the domain, and ${B}$ is the codomain. Thus, whenever we see
		the notation ${x \mathrel{R} y}$, we can infer that ${(x,y) \in \space
		\mathrel{R}.}$ And whenever we see the notation ${x \not\mathrel{R} y}$, we
		can infer that ${(x,y) \notin \space \mathrel{R}.}$
	</p>
	<div class="mainIdea">
		<p>${a \mathrel{R} b \implies (a, b) \in \space \mathrel{R}}$</p>
		<p>${a \not\mathrel{R} b \implies (a, b) \notin \space \mathrel{R}}$</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		If ${(x, y) \in \space \mathrel{R},}$ we say that ${x}$ is related to ${y}$
		by ${\mathrel{R}.}$ Importantly, notice the relation ${\mathrel{R}}$
		concerns only two sets, ${A}$ and ${B.}$ Hence our defining the relation as
		a
		<span class="italicsText">binary relation</span>, rather than just simply
		&#8220;relation.&#8221; We include the distinction &#8220;binary&#8221;
		because there are many kinds of relations, and a relation between two sets
		&mdash; a binary relation &mdash; is just one of them.

		<h2>Relations on a Set</h2>
		<p>
			Relations from a set ${S}$ to itself are called
			<span class="term">relations on a set</span>. In the previous examples, we
			considered binary relations, which always involve two sets, say ${A}$ and
			${B.}$ With a relation on a set, we're concerned with just a single a set,
			and the relationships between the set's members. Suppose we had a set ${S
			= \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}.}$ Now suppose the following relationships:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>${\mathrel{R}_1 = (1, 2)}$</li>
			<li>${\mathrel{R}_2 = (2, 1)}$</li>
			<li>${\mathrel{R}_3 = (3, 1)}$</li>
			<li>${\mathrel{R}_4 = (3, 3)}$</li>
			<li>${\mathrel{R}_5 = (3, 4)}$</li>
			<li>${\mathrel{R}_6 = (4, 4)}$</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We can graphically represent the relationships as:</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/relation1.svg' %}"
				alt="A relation map"
				loading="lazy"
				class="thirty-p"
			/>
		</figure>
		<p>
			First, this is a relation with a single
			<span class="term">base set</span>. Each of the arrows above represents a
			single relationship. All of these relationships, put together, form a
			<span class="italicsText">relation</span> on ${A.}$ Here, we see that
			${1}$ has a relationship with ${2,}$ and ${2}$ has a relationship with
			${1.}$ ${3}$ has a relationship with ${1,}$ but ${1}$ does not have
			relationship with ${3.}$ ${3}$ has a relationship with ${4,}$ but ${4}$
			does not have a relationship with ${3.}$ Both ${3}$ and ${4}$ have
			relationships with themselves. This type of relationship is called a
			<span class="term">loop</span>.
		</p>
		<p>Alternatively, we could have represented the relation with a table:</p>

		<p>
			The relation we just considered is purely demonstrative. What it does not
			show is why relations are useful. Here's a better demo:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img
				src="{% static 'images/relation2.svg' %}"
				alt="A relation map"
				loading="lazy"
				class="thirty-p"

		</figure>
		<p>
			This relation diagram depicts a
			<span class="italicsText">divides</span> relation. ${2}$ divides ${4,}$
			and ${4}$ divides ${12.}$ ${2}$ also divides ${12.}$ Similarly, ${3}$
			divides ${6,}$ but ${3}$ does not divide ${2,}$ nor does ${2}$ divide
			${3.}$ The diagram demonstrates the usefulness of relations &mdash; they
			are abstractions for <span class="italicsText">structures</span>. We can
			take some arbitrarily complex structure &mdash; an outline for a class,
			the characters in a novel, the novel itself, a legal statute, a
			classification system &mdash; and express it as a relation.

	<section id="properties_of_relations">
		<h2>Properties of Relations</h2>
		<p>
			In the previous examples, we saw how some relations have direction,
			whether that's to other objects or to themselves. This is evidence of the
			fact that relations have properties. We examine each of these properties
			below.
		</p>
		<section id="reflexive_relations">
			<h3>Reflexive Relations</h3>
			<p>
				Let's say we gathered all of the people in the world into a set ${A,}$
				and constructed another set containing the same members, call it ${B.}$
				Now suppose we construct the Cartesian product ${A \times B.}$ The set
				${A \times B}$ consists of the members ${(a, b),}$ where ${a \in A}$ and
				${b \in B.}$ Finally, we define a relation: ${R}$ consisting of ${(a,
				b)}$ where ${a}$ and ${b}$ have the same mother and the same father. It
				follows that ${a \mathrel{R} a}$ for every person ${a.}$ This is the
				property of <span class="term">reflexivity</span>.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div class="rule">
					<p>
						<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A relation ${\mathrel{R}}$ on
						a set ${A}$ is <span class="italicsText">reflexive</span> iff
						${\space\forall a \in A : (a,a) \in \space \mathrel{R}.}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If we represented reflexive relations visually, every element would have
				loops:
			</p>

				<img
					src="{% static 'images/reflexiveRelation.svg' %}"
					alt="Two reflexive relations"
					loading="lazy"
					class="seventy-p"

				<figcaption>Two reflexive relations, ${L}$ and ${M}$</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>

		<section id="irrelexive_relations">
			<h3>Irreflexive Relations</h3>
			<p>
				If we removed <span class="underlineText">all</span> of the loops in a
				relation (a relation containing no loops whatsoever):
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img
					src="{% static 'images/irreflexiveRelation.svg' %}"
					alt="Two reflexive relations"
					loading="lazy"
					class="fifty-p"
				/>
				<figcaption>The irreflexive relation ${N}$</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				we would have an <span class="term">irreflexive relation</span>.
				Formally:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div class="rule">
					<p>
						<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A relation ${\mathrel{R}}$ on
						a set ${A}$ is <span class="italicsText">irreflexive</span> iff
						${\space\forall a \in A : (a,a) \notin \space \mathrel{R}.}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Note that the definition for irreflexivity implies expresses more than
				not reflexive. If some elements have loops and others do not, we say
				that the reflexion is <span class="term">not reflexive</span>. For the
				relation to be irreflexive, there must be no loops entirely. For
				example, the relation ${<}$ is irreflexive on the integers, since no
				integer is less than itself. Otherwise, the relation is either reflexive
				or not reflexive.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="symmetry">
			<h3>Symmetric Relations</h3>
			<p>
				Suppose ${x}$ is the sibling of ${y.}$ Is ${y}$ the sibling of ${x?}$
				Yes. This is an example of a
				<span class="term">symmetric relation</span>: A relation where some
				element ${a}$ is related to a second element ${b}$ if and only if the
				second element ${b}$ is also related to the first element ${a.}$
				Explicitly:
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div class="rule">
					<p>
						<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${S}$ be a set. A

								\implies (b, a) \in \space \mathrel{R}}$
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Visually, we can identify symmetric relations by arrows going to and
				from two elements respectively:

					alt="Three symmetric relations"
					loading="lazy"

				<figcaption>Symmetric relations ${A}$, ${B}$, and ${C}$</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				As an aside, when we diagram relations, we can also use single segments
				with two arrowheads for shorthand (but using separate arrows is
				clearer):

			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="antisymmetric">
			<h3>Antisymmetric Relations</h3>
			<p>
				Now suppose ${x}$ is the father of ${y.}$ Is ${y}$ the father of ${x?}$
				Of course not. The &#8220;father of&#8221; relation is an example of an

			<span class="topic">The Circle Relation.</span> One example of a relation
