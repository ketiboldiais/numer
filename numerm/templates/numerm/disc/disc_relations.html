<section id="relations">
	<p>
		As humans, we perceive the world according to the way things relate to one
		another. Corporate hierarchy, family relationships, friend networks, court
		systems, if-then, if-and-only-if, cause and effect, these are all
		relationships. Mathematical objects are no different &mdash; they too have
		relationships to other mathematical objects. The set $A$ is related to the
		set $B$ if ${ A \subseteq B }$. The number $a$ is related to the number $b$
		if ${ a < b }$, or if ${ a^2 + b^2 = 1 }$.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematics, if a mathematical object $x$ is related to a mathematical
		object ${y,}$ we write:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${ x \mathrel{R} y }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To denote "$x$ is related to $y$." If $x$ is not related to $y$, we write:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${x \not\mathrel{R} y }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		For example, suppose we have two sets: ${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$ and ${B = \{ 1,
		2, 3 \}}$. Suppose further that an element ${a \in A}$ is related to an
		element ${b \in B}$, if, and only if, ${a < b}$. From this rule, we can
		infer:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${0 \mathrel{R} 1}$ since ${0 < 1,}$</li>
		<li>${0 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${0 < 3,}$</li>
		<li>${1 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${1 < 2,}$</li>
		<li>${1 \mathrel{R} 3}$, since ${1 < 3,}$</li>
		<li>${2 \mathrel{R} 3}$ since ${2 < 3,}$</li>
		<li>${1 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${1 \nless 1,}$</li>
		<li>${2 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${2 \nless 1,}$ and</li>
		<li>${2 \not\mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${2 \nless 2}$</li>

	<h2>Cartesian Products & Relations</h2>
	<p>
		Recall: Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the
		<span class="italicsText">Cartesian product</span> ${A \times B}$ is the set
		of all ordered pairs ${(x, y)}$ such that ${x \in A}$ and ${y \in B}$. Or,
		more formally:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A \times B = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in A \text{ and } y \in B \}}$.</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>So, suppose we had two simple sets:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$</p>
			<p>${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The Cartesian product ${A \times B}$ is:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			$$ A \times B = \left\{ \begin{aligned} & (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), \\ & (1,1),
			(1,2), (1,3), \\ & (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) \end{aligned} \right\} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we know what ordered pairs are members of ${A \times B}$, then we know
		which elements of $A$ are related to which elements of $B$ and vice versa.
		More formally:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. A
				<span class="term">binary relation</span> ${R}$ from ${A}$ to ${B}$ is a
				subset of ${A \times B}$. Or, in set notation:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${A \mathrel{R} B \subseteq A \times B}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>From the definition above, we have the following corollary:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Corollary.</span> Given ${(x,y) \in A \times B}$,
				${x}$ is related to ${y}$ by $\mathrel{R,}$ denoted ${x \mathrel{R} y,}$
				if, and only if, ${(x,y) \in \mathrel{R}}$.
			</p>
			<p>
				The set ${A}$ is called the <span class="term">domain</span> of ${R}$,
				and the set ${B}$ is called the <span class="term">codomain</span> of
				${R}$.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We denote the domain and codomain of a relation with the notation:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\mathrel{R} : A \mapsto B }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		where ${A}$ is the domain, and ${B}$ is the codomain. Thus, whenever we see
		the notation ${x \mathrel{R} y}$, we can infer that ${(x,y) \in
		\mathrel{R}.}$ And whenever we see the notation ${x \not\mathrel{R} y}$, we
		can infer that ${(x,y) \notin \mathrel{R}.}$
	</p>
	<div class="mainIdea">
		<p>${a \mathrel{R} b \implies (a, b) \in \mathrel{R}}$</p>
		<p>${a \not\mathrel{R} b \implies (a, b) \notin \mathrel{R}}$</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		If ${(x, y) \in \mathrel{R},}$ we say that ${x}$ is related to ${y}$ by
		${\mathrel{R}.}$ Importantly, notice the relation ${\mathrel{R}}$ concerns
		only two sets, ${A}$ and ${B.}$ Hence our defining the relation as a
		<span class="italicsText">binary relation</span>, rather than just simply
		&#8220;relation.&#8221; We include the distinction &#8220;binary&#8221;
		because there are many kinds of relations, and a relation between two sets
		&mdash; a binary relation &mdash; is just one of them.

<section id="relations_on_a_set">
	<h2>Relations on a Set</h2>
	<p>
		Relations from a set ${S}$ to itself are called
		<span class="term">relations on a set</span>. In the previous examples, we
		considered binary relations, which always involve two sets, say ${A}$ and
		${B.}$ With a relation on a set, we're concerned with just a single a set,
		and the relationships between the set's members. Suppose we had a set ${S =
		\{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}.}$ Now suppose the following relationships:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${\mathrel{R}_1 = (1, 2)}$</li>
		<li>${\mathrel{R}_2 = (2, 1)}$</li>
		<li>${\mathrel{R}_3 = (3, 1)}$</li>
		<li>${\mathrel{R}_4 = (3, 3)}$</li>
		<li>${\mathrel{R}_5 = (3, 4)}$</li>
		<li>${\mathrel{R}_6 = (4, 4)}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>We can also graphically represent the relationships as:</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/relation1.svg' %}"
			alt="A relation map"
			loading="lazy"
			class="forty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		First, this is a relation with a single <span class="term">base set</span>.
		Each of the arrows above represents a single relationship. All of these
		relationships, put together, form a
		<span class="italicsText">relation</span> on ${A.}$ Here, we see that ${1}$
		has a relationship with ${2,}$ and ${2}$ has a relationship with ${1.}$
		${3}$ has a relationship with ${1,}$ but ${1}$ does not have relationship
		with ${3.}$ ${3}$ has a relationship with ${4,}$ but ${4}$ does not have a
		relationship with ${3.}$ Both ${3}$ and ${4}$ have relationships with
		themselves. This type of relationship is called a
		<span class="term">loop</span>.
	</p>
	<p>Alternatively, we could have represented the relation with a table:</p>
	<figure>
		<table class="relation">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>${R}$</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>4</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>${\times}$</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The relation we just considered is purely demonstrative. What it does not
		show is why relations are useful. Here's a better demo:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/relation2.svg' %}"
			alt="A relation map"
			loading="lazy"
			class="fifty-p"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This relation diagram depicts a
		<span class="italicsText">divides</span> relation. ${2}$ divides ${4,}$ and
		${4}$ divides ${12.}$ ${2}$ also divides ${12.}$ Similarly, ${3}$ divides
		${6,}$ but ${3}$ does not divide ${2,}$ nor does ${2}$ divide ${3.}$ The
		diagram demonstrates the usefulness of relations &mdash; they are
		abstractions for <span class="italicsText">structures</span>. We can take
		some arbitrarily complex structure &mdash; an outline for a class, the
		characters in a novel, the novel itself, a legal statute, a classification
		system &mdash; and express it as a relation.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="circle_relation">
	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Circle Relation.</span> One example of a relation is
		the <span class="term">circle relation</span>. We can define it as follows:
		Let $C$ be a relation from ${\mathbb{R}}$ to ${\mathbb{R}.}$ For any ${(x,y)
		\in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R},}$ ${(x,y) \in C}$ means that ${x^2 + y^2 =
		1.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Here, the domain of $C$ is all real numbers, ${\mathbb{R}}$. Its codmain is
		also ${\mathbb{R}.}$
