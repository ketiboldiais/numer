<h1>Propositional Logic</h1>
<section id="the_logic_of_compound_statements_introduction">
	<p>
		Propositional logic provides the foundations of both computer science
		and mathematics. The following materials provide a review of the logic
		necessary to understanding mathematics.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two kinds of mathematical statements: <b>predicates</b> and
		<b>propositions</b>. A proposition is a special kind of mathematical
		statement &mdash; it's a statement that can be verified as either true
		or false. For example, all of statements below are examples of
		mathematical statements:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${1 + 2 = 3}$</li>
		<li>${x &lt; x + 1}$</li>
		<li>${\pi = 3}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Each of the statements above can be verified as true or false.
		Mathematical statements, however, don't have to be written with
		symbols. In fact, much of formal mathematics is written in prose:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Every even integer greater than ${2}$ can be written as the sum of
			two prime numbers.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The statement above is a famous mathematical statement called the
		<cite>Goldbach Conjecture</cite>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <b>predicate</b> is an <q>incomplete</q> mathematical statement. By
		<q>incomplete</q> we mean a statement that cannot be verified as true
		or false unless we add further specification. Mathematical predicates
		are also called <i>open sentences</i> or <b>expressions.</b> For
		example, the following are all predicates:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${1 + 1}$</li>
		<li>${n^2 - 2n &gt; 0}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The expression ${1+1}$ cannot be evaluated as true or false because it
		merely expresses, or communicates, some predicate. In this case, the
		predicate ${1+1.}$ What we need is further specification:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>${1+1 = 2}$</li>
		<li>${1+1 &gt; 3}$</li>
		<li>${1+1 \leq 2}$</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The same idea extends to the statement ${n^2 - n &gt; 0.}$ We cannot
		verify whether this statement is true or false because we don't know
		what ${n}$ is an element of. If ${n}$ is any integer, then the
		statement is false, since ${n=0}$ renders the statement false. If ${n =
		3,}$ then the statement is true.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="logical_form_and_logical_equivalence">
	<h2>Arguments</h2>
	<p>
		An <span class="term">argument</span> is a sequence of statements
		leading to an assertion. The assertion at the end of the sequence is
		called the <span class="term">conclusion</span>, and the preceding
		statements are called <span class="term">premises</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we create or assess arguments, there are two things we should
		always distinguish: (1) The argument's
		<span class="italicsText">intrinsic merit</span>; and (2) The
		argument's <span class="italicsText">form</span>. Logical analysis has
		no business, and provides no help, with an argument's intrinsic merits.
		Where it does help, however, is determining whether a conclusion
		<span class="italicsText">necessarily</span> follows from the
		<span class="italicsText">truth</span> of the premises.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider the argument: "If taxes are raised, then
		unemployment increases. If unemployment increases, then government
		expenditures increase. Since government expenditures did not increase,
		taxes were not raised." Strictly from a logical analysis, there are no
		problems with this argument. But, there may be problems with the
		argument's intrinsic merits (is it not the case that government
		expenditures can go unchanged, or even decrease, while taxes are
		raised?). Logic does not help determine whether the argument's premises
		are true (Is it true that raising taxes increases unemployment? Is it
		true that increased unemployment leads to increased government
		expenditures?). Logic can help determine whether the premises are
		conclusions that necessarily follow from other premises, but without
		more, logical analysis provides no aid here.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="logical_propositions">
	<h2>Logical Statements</h2>
	<p>
		Arguments consist of <span class="term">propositions</span> &mdash;
		sentences that can be assigned the values
		<span class="italicsText">true</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>, but not both. The entirety of
		mathematics is composed of terms defined by using terms previously
		defined. This process of using terms to define terms, however, had to
		start somewhere. For this reason, there are a few terms in mathematics
		taken to be <span class="italicsText">undefined</span>. The terms
		<span class="italicsText">sentence</span>,
		<span class="italicsText">true</span>, and
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>, are examples of undefined terms
		in mathematics. Following the definition of a proposition, the
		following sentences are propositions:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${1 + 1 = 2}$ (true)</p>
			<p>${2^2 = 18}$ (false)</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The sentence ${x^2 = 16}$ is not a proposition, because we cannot
		assign it the value true or false unless we provide some value for $x$.
		It is both true or false, depending on $x$.
	</p>
</section>

<section id="compound_propositions_logical_connectives">
	<h2>Compound Propositions &amp; Logical Connectives</h2>
	<p>
		Propositions can be connected with
		<span class="italicsText">logical connectives</span> to create
		<span class="term">compound propositions</span>. For example, the
		propositions "$x$ is less than <span class="italicsText">or</span> to
		4" and "$s$ is a member of $A$ but not a member of $B$" are examples of
		compound propositions.
	</p>
	<p>
		To form compound propositions, the connected propositions must have set
		truth values. In other words, we cannot connect propositions that do
		not already have the assigned values of
		<span class="italicsText">true</span> or
		<span class="italicsText">false</span>. Once we
		<span class="italicsText">know</span> what the truth values for
		individual propositions, we can then connect them with logical
		connectives. We investigate the most common logical connectives in the
		next sections.
	</p>

	<section id="not">
		<h3>Logical NOT</h3>
		<p>
			The logical connective
			<span class="monoText">NOT</span> is the
			<span class="italicsText">logical negation</span>. It takes a
			proposition, and returns the proposition with the opposite truth
			value. More formally: Let $p$ be a proposition. The negation of $p$
			is "<span class="monoText">NOT</span> p," or, "It is
			<span class="monoText">NOT</span> the case that $p$." We denote the
			negation of $p$ with ${\neg p.}$ If $p$ is true, then ${\neg p}$ is
			false; if $p$ is false, then ${\neg p}$ is true.
		</p>
		<p>We can summarize the possibilities with a truth table:</p>
		<figure class="table">
			<table class="truth_table">
				<thead>
					<th>$p$</th>
					<th>${\neg p}$</th>

				<tbody>
					<tr>

		<section id="double_negative">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">The Double Negative Property.</span> The
				<span class="term">double negative property</span> provides that,
				given a proposition $p$, the negation of the negation of $p$ is
				simply $p$. We can see this to be the case from the truth table for
				${\neg (\neg p)}$:

	<section id="and">
		<h3>Logical AND</h3>
		<p>
			The logical connective
			<span class="monoText">AND</span> is the

			<span class="monoText">AND</span> $q$," denoted ${p \land q.}$ If,
			and only if, $p$ is true and $q$ is true, then ${p \land q}$ is true.
			If $p$ is false, $q$ is false, or both $p$ and $q$ are false, then
			${p \land q}$ is false.

	<section id="neither_nor">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">NEITHER NOR.</span> The sentence structure
			<span class="monoText">"NEITHER NOR</span> in logic is simply the

		<p>
			Note that this definition of <span class="monoText">OR</span> differs
			from our more common usage of <span class="italicsText">or</span>,
			which generally denotes "one or the other, but not both." This common
			usage of <span class="italicsText">or</span> is called the
			<span class="term">exclusive or</span>. In mathematics and computer
			science, we use the <span class="term">inclusive or</span> by default
			&mdash; "one or the other, or both." When the
			<span class="italicsText">exclusive or</span> is used, mathematicians
			and computer scientists will make it explicit with sentence
			structures such as "$A$ or $B$ but not both," or, occassionally,
			"Either $A$ or $B$." The
			<span class="italicsText">exclusive or</span> (<span class="monoText"
				>XOR</span
			>) is covered in later sections.

		<h3>Logical XOR</h3>
		<p>
			The logical connective

			The proposition ${p \oplus q}$ is true if, and only if, $p$ is true

	<h2>Inequalities and Logic</h2>
	<p>
		One of the most common relationships between discrete objects in
		mathematics is inequality. Inequalities, as a matter of logic, are just
		compound propositions. However, they are so frequent in mathematics
		that we've given them special symbols.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let $x$, $b$, and $a$ be real numbers. The following statements are
		compound propositions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The statement ${x \leq a}$ means:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>${x < a}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${x = a}$</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The statement ${x \geq a}$ means:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>${x > a}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${x = a}$</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The statement ${a \leq x \leq b}$ means:</li>

		<li>The statement ${a \geq x \geq b}$ means:</li>

<section id="logical_equivalence">
	<h2>Logical Equivalence &amp; Propositional Forms</h2>
	<p>
		Given propositions $p$ and $q$, we can use logical connectives to
		construct the compound propositions ${\neg p}$, ${p \land q}$, and ${p
		\lor q.}$ Compound propositions themselves can be connected to form
		more complicated expressions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>${\neg p \lor q}$</li>
		<li>${(\neg p \lor q) \land \neg (p \lor q)}$</li>
		<li>${\neg ((p \land q) \lor (p \land (p \lor \neg q)))}$</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These expressions are called
		<span class="term">propositional forms</span>. When determining a
		propositional form's truth value, we follow the
		<span class="italicsText">Boolean order of operations</span>:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Expressions inside brackets/parentheses are performed first</li>
		<li>
			The <span class="monoText">NOT</span> operator is performed second.
		</li>
		<li>
			The operator <span class="monoText">AND</span> is performed third.
		</li>
		<li>
			The operator <span class="monoText">OR</span> is performed last.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Logical Equivalence.</span> The statements "2 is
		greater than 1" and "1 is less than 2" are two different ways of saying
		the same thing. This is because of the definitions of the words
		&#8220;greater than&#8221; and &#8220;less than.&#8221; Both
		statements, together, can only be: (1) both true, or (2) both false. In
		other words, if the statements were connected with a logical connective
		and evaluated in a truth table, their truth values would be identical.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions. The compound
		propositions ${p \land q}$ and ${q \land p}$ have the same truth

		When two <span class="italicsText">proposition forms</span> have the
		same truth values, we say that they are
		<span class="term">logically equivalent</span>. More formally, two
		proposition forms are
		<span class="italicsText">logically equivalent</span> if, and only if,
		they have identical truth values for each possible substitution of
		statements for their statement variables. The logical equivalence of
		statement forms $p$ and $q$ is denoted by writing ${p \equiv q.}$
	</p>

		Two <span class="italicsText">propositions</span> are

<section id="deMorgans_laws">
	<h2>De Morgan's Laws</h2>
	<p>
		Consider the proposition: &#8220;Apples are reed and sweet.&#8221; This
		is a compound proposition: (1) &#8220;Apples are red&#8221; (2)
		&#8220;Apples are sweet&#8221; For the proposition to be false (the
		proposition's negation), one or both of (1) and (2) must be false.
		I.e., "Apples are NOT red BUT sweet"; "Apples are red BUT NOT sweet";
		"Apples are NOT red AND are NOT sweet." These propositions can be
		reduced to a single proposition: "Apples are NOT red OR are NOT sweet."
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, consider the proposition: "Apples are red OR green." Like
		the
		<span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition above, this is a compound
		proposition: (1) "Apples are red." (2) "Apples are green." Thus, for
		the compound proposition to be false, both (1) and (2) must be false,
		because an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition is false if,
		and only if, both of its component propositions are false. The negation
		then is: "Apples are NOT red AND are NOT green."
	</p>
	<p>
		DeMorgan's laws formalize this reduction. The negation of an
		<span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition is logically equivalent
		to the <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition in which each
		component proposition is <span class="italicsText">negated</span>. The
		negation of an <span class="monoText">OR</span> statement is logically
		equivalent to the <span class="monoText">AND</span> statement in which

			Negating compound inequalities is a common source of error for
			novices. Confronted with an inequality of the form ${x < y \leq z}$,
			it is tempting to write: ${x \nless y \nleq z.}$ Temptation be gone!
			This is
			<span class="underlineText">wrong</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose a compound inequality of the form ${x \stackrel{?}= y
			\stackrel{?}= z.}$<sup></sup> This compound inequality consists of
			two component propositions:
		</p>
		<div class="note">
			<p>
				the symbol ${\stackrel{?}=}$ means "unknown relation," and
				represents the possibility of any of the relation symbols $=$, $>$,
				$<$, $\leq$, $\geq$, etc.
			</p>
		</div>
		<ol>
			<li>${x \stackrel{?}= y}$ <span class="monoText">AND</span></li>
			<li>${y \stackrel{?}= z.}$</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Thus, the negation of the compound inequality is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				${\neg (x \stackrel{?}= y)}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span>
			</li>
			<li>${\neg (y \stackrel{?}= z).}$</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For example, suppose the compound inequality ${x < y \leq z.}$ The
			negation of this proposition is:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>${x \nless y}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${y \nleq z}$.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Proposition (1), ${x \nless y,}$ means that ${x \geq y}$. Proposition
			(2), ${x \nleq z,}$ means that ${y > z.}$ Thus, the negation of the
			proposition, reduced, is:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>${x \geq y}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${y > z}$.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			It follows that the negation of ${x < y \leq z}$ leaves several
			possibilities:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>${x > y}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${x = y}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
			<li>${y > z}$</li>
		</ol>

	<section id="conditionals_and_logic_equivalence">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Conditionals & Logical Equivalence.</span>
			Conditionals can be tricky to determine the logical equivalence for.
			There are three ways to determine whether propositions are logically
			equivalent: (1) Construct a truth table; (2) apply a sequence of
			known logical equivalences; or (3) divergent thinking.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we've seen, truth tables are the most explicit way to confirm that
			propositions are logically equivalent. But, truth tables are very
			easy to make mistakes with. Moreover, if we have ${n}$ propositions,
			the number of rows for the truth table is ${2^n}$ &mdash; the table
			grows exponentially with the number of propositions. After 2 through
			3 propositions, we're much more likely to either exhaust ourselves or
			make mistakes. They simply don't scale well.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second approach is to use a sequence of known logical
			equivalences. Here, we perform logical evaluations much like algebra.
			We substitute known logical equivalences with variables, and evaluate
			accordingly. This approach can be particularly effective when used
			alongside truth tables. The risk here with logical equivalences is
			going around in circles. It's very easy to fall into duplicated
			analyses. We avoid this problem by having a clear plan for
			evaluation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The third approach is what we call &#8220;divergent thinking.&#8221;
			With this approach, we use a mixture of intuition, analogy, and
			modularity. There really isn't a set formula for this approach. We
			break down the problem into smaller pieces, and ask ourselves what
			should be true? What should be false? We can also substitute words in
			the propositions to check if they make sense intuitively. This
			approach usually yields informal arguments, so it's often necessary
			to use the other two approaches for confirmation. Fortunately,
			divergent thinking tends to yield plans helpful for the second
			approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, suppose we had the proposition ${p \implies (q \implies
			r).}$ Using the divergent thinking approach, we ask ourselves,
			&#8220;When is this proposition false?&#8221; Well, we know that an
			implication is false when the sufficient condition is true and the
			necessary condition is false. So, we turn to the necessary condition.
			When is the necessary condition false? Again, when the sufficient
			condition is true and the necessary condition is false. Thus, the
			proposition ${p \implies (q \implies r)}$ is false iff ${p \implies
			(q \implies (\neg r).}$ Or, by logical equivalence, ${a \implies q
			\land (\neg r).}$ Thus, ${p \implies (q \implies r)}$ is false if,
			and only if, ${p}$ and ${q}$ are true, and ${r}$ is false. We can
			then draw a logical equivalence:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				$$ \begin{aligned} p \implies (q \implies r) &\equiv (\neg p) \lor
				(q \implies r) \\ &\equiv (\neg p) \lor (\neg q \lor r) \\ &\equiv
				(\neg p) \lor (\neg q) \lor r \end{aligned} $$ $$ \neg (p \implies
				(q \implies r)) \equiv p \land q \land (\neg r) $$

	<section id="division_into_cases">
		<h3>Division Into Cases</h3>
		<p>
			A frequent analysis in mathematics is dividing propositions into
			cases. Whenever we encounter a conditional of the form:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<div>
				<p>${a \lor b \implies c}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>there are two cases:</p>

			<div>
				$$ (a \lor b \implies c) \space \begin{cases} a \implies c \\ b
				\implies c \end{cases} $$
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Thus, to prove that ${a \lor b \implies c}$ is true, we must prove
			that:
		</p>
		<ol>

	<h2>Implications as Logical Disjunctions</h2>
	<p>
		The <i>if..then..</i> proposition is logically equivalent to the
		<i>or</i> proposition. In fact, this is apparent from every day speech.
		Consider the statement:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>"Either you study or you receive poor grades."</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Suppose ${\neg s \coloneqq \texttt{"you study"}}$ and ${r \coloneqq
		\texttt{"you receive poor grades"}.}$ Accordingly, ${s \coloneqq
		\texttt{"you do not study"}.}$ Thus, ${(\neg s) \lor r \coloneqq
		\texttt{"You study OR you receive poor grades"}.}$ The equivalent
		proposition is ${s \implies r:}$
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>"If you do not study, then you receive poor grades."</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can see that this is true with truth table:</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>$p$</th>
				<th>$q$</th>
				<th>${\neg p}$</th>
				<th>${p \implies q}$</th>
				<th>${(\neg p) \lor q}$</th>

	</figure>
	<p>
		Both ${p \implies q}$ and ${\neg p \lor q}$ have the same truth values;
		they are logically equivalent.Similarly, if ${q \implies p,}$ then ${(q
		\implies p) \equiv ((\neg q) \lor p).}$
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>$q$</th>

	<p>Accordingly, we have the following logical equivalence:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem.</span> Given propositions ${p}$ and
				${q,}$
			</p>
			<figure>

				</div>

		</div>
	</figure>
</section>

<section id="negating_if-then">
	<h2>Negative Implications</h2>
	<p>
		The fact that ${(p \implies q) \equiv ((\neg p) \lor q)}$ yields
		several inferences:
	</p>
	<div class="mproof">
		<div class="premises">
			<ul>
				<li>${\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q)}$</li>
				<li>negating both sides</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					${\phantom{\neg (p \implies q)} \equiv \neg ((\neg p) \lor q)}$
				</li>
				<li>De Morgan's laws</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>${\phantom{\neg (p \implies q)} \equiv p \land (\neg q)}$</li>
				<li>the double negative law</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Thus, we have the following fact:</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${\neg (p \implies q) \equiv (p \land \neg q)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In other words, the negation of ${\text{"If p then q"}}$ is ${\text{"p
		and not q"}.}$ We can see this in everyday speech with the word "but."
		For example:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<ul>
			<li>"If I timely submit my assignment, I will not lose points"</li>
			<li>"I timely submit my assignment, but I lose points."</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>For those fond of Victorian horror:</p>
	<figure>
		<ul>
			<li>Proposition: "If Dracula is a man, then Dracula is human"</li>
			<li>Negation: "Dracula is a man but not human."</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we have the following theorem:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Theorem.</span> Given propositions ${p}$ and
				${q,}$
			</p>
			<figure>
				<div>
					<p>
						${\neg (p \implies q) \equiv \neg [q \lor (\neg p)] \equiv
						(\neg q) \land p}$
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As an aside, the last example might spark some thought about how we
		assign truth values to propositions. Consider for example Immanuel
		Kant's observation of three values: the "alive," the "dead," and
		somewhere in the middle, the "undead." Is there any relationship
		between the fact that these terms exist and how we evaluate the truth
		values of propositions? If the answer is yes, does the relationship
		affect the proposition that such a relationship exists?
	</p>

<section id="the_contrapositive">
	<h2>The Contrapositive</h2>
	<p>
		A foundational law of logic is the equivalence between a conditonal and
		its
		<span class="term">contrapositive</span>. Suppose the statement, If I
		go to class, then I will attend lecture." The contrapositive of this
		proposition is: If I do not attend lecture, then I do not go to class."
	</p>
	<p>
		More formally: Given a conditional of the form ${p \implies q}$, its
		contrapositive is
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(\neg q) \implies (\neg p)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		A conditional is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. We can see
		that this is true with a proof table. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are
		propositions.
	</p>
	<figure class="table">
		<table class="truth_table">
			<thead>
				<th>$a$</th>
				<th>$b$</th>
				<th>${\neg b}$</th>
				<th>${\neg a}$</th>

	<p>
		The fact that a conditional's contrapositive is logically equivalent to
		the conditional is a valuable asset. Often, proving a conditional
		proposition's contrapositive is much easier than proving the
		conditional proposition itself.

	<h2>The Biconditional</h2>

		A

	<p>
		Observe that the biconditional "$p$ iff $q$" is logically equivalent to
		"$p$ if $q$ and $q$ if $p$." In other words, the biconditional is
		logically equivalent to the conjunction of the conditional and its
		converse. Symbolically:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div>
			<p>${(p \iff q) \equiv ((p \implies q) \land (q \implies p))}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This is helpful result. Biconditionals are much easier to prove or work
		with when they are reduced to the conditional and its converse.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the Boolean order of operations, the connective ${\iff}$ is coequal
		with ${\implies.}$ Like ${\land}$ and ${\lor,}$ the only way to
		indicate one's precedence over the other is to use parentheses. Thus,
		the Boolean order of operations thus far proceeds as such:
	</p>
	<ol>
