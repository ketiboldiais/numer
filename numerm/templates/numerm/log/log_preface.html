<h1>Logic</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">L</span>ogic provides the foundations of mathematics. For
		this reason, we devote an entirely separate volume for its study. Without
		logic, mathematics would not stand. And without mathematics astand, the
		world as we know it would crumble. But the field of logic is not purely
		sequestered to the mathematical domain. Running like ivy, we see logic in
		metaphysics, epistemology, the sciences, politics, economics, medicine, law
		&mdash; we would exhaust ourselves before tracing all of its reaches.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where the natural sciences and mathematics provide tools to interrogate the
		world we live in, logic is the final arbiter of our findings. Like the
		Egyptian god Maat, it divorces fact from fiction, identifying truth from
		falsity. At times, it does so with clarity and fine lines, austere and cold
		in beauty. At others, it speaks to us like a Delphic oracle &mdash; divining
		the truth in mysterious, esoteric ways.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our study in this volume focuses on how to use, analyze, and interpret the
		dictates of logic. We will find that much of everyday speech conflicts with
		logic, and for that reason, we depend heavily on symbols. We will see how
		certain logical conclusions appear nonsensical and unintuitive, but we
		cannot escape them. We will experience awe and disbelief when we realize
		there are, in fact, exits. We will learn that the antagonist in all of this
		is <span class="italicsText">doubt</span>. We will discover that logic
		attempts to eradicate this villain repeatedly. And just when we think we've
		witnessed doubt's demise, the scene cuts to a hand reaching out the water.
