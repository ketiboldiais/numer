<h1>Systems of Linear Equations</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		We're familiar with linear equations: ${y = mx + b,}$ ${ax + by + c = 0,}$
		${y = cb,}$ these equations all form lines on the Cartesian plane. In the
		linear algebra kingdom, we move beyond the flatland of a 2-dimensional plane
		into a world of higher dimensions.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> A
				<span class="term">linear equation</span> is an equation of the form:
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>
				where ${b}$ and the <span class="term">coefficients</span> ${a_1x_1,
				a2x_2, \ldots, a_nx_n}$ are real or complex constants.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As long as we can arrange an equation into the form above, we can say that
		we have a linear equation. For example, the following are all linear
		equations:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2a = 3}$</p>
			<p>${4y - 7 = 0}$</p>
			<p>${3m - n = 4}$</p>
			<p>${x_2 = 2(\sqrt{6} - x_1) + x_3}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>However, these equations are not:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${3x^2 + 5x + 6 = y}$</p>
			<p>${m = 2 \sqrt{n} - 6}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Consider the linear equation ${x_1 + 2x_2 - 3x_3 = 8.}$ What values can we
		substitute for the variables such that the equation is true? Well, we can
		think of a few:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${3 + 2(4) - 3(1) = 8;}$ ${x_1 = 3,}$ ${x_2 = 4,}$ ${x_3 = 1}$</p>
			<p>${-1 + 2(3) - 3(-1) = 8;}$ ${x_1 = -1,}$ ${x_2 = 3,}$ ${x_3 = -1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we tried finding all the solutions, we might be at it for a while. The
		equation has an infinite number of solutions: ${x_1 = 8 - 2s + 3t,}$ where
		${x_2 = s,}$ ${x_3 = t,}$ and ${s, t \in \R.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		A set of linear equations is called a
		<span class="term">system of linear equations</span>, or more concisely, a
		<span class="term">linear system</span>. Here's an example of a linear
		system:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>${2x + 2y = 3}$</li>
				<li>${2x + y = 2.5}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Linear algebra is the investigation of such systems, where the predominant
		questions include, but are not limited to: Does the linear system have any
		solutions? Does the system have no solution, a unique solution, or an
		infinite number of solutions? If there are solutions, how do we find them?
		Do the solutions have a structure or pattern? These questions will guide our
		exploration of the linear algebra world.

	<h2>Simple Approaches to Solving Linear Systems</h2>
	<p>
		Let's start by looking at some rudimentary and straightforward ways to
		solving linear systems. Because these are the easiest approaches to apply,
		we should always consider whether we can use them before going on to more
		sophisticated tactics.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Subtracting Equations.</span> Looking at our previous
		example, we can find the solution to the linear system by subtracting the
		(2) from (1):
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 2x + 2y &= 3 \\ -(2x + y &= 2.5) \\ \hline 0 + y &= 0.5
			\end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		As we can see, ${y = 0.5.}$ But, the solution set is incomplete; we still
		need ${x.}$ Plugging ${y}$ into (1):
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 2x + 2y &= 3 \\ 2x + 2(0.5) &= 3 \\ 2x + 1 &= 3 \\ 2x +
			1 - 1 &= 3 - 1 \\ 2x &= 2 \\ x &= 1 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Our solution set is thus ${\{ x, y \in \R \mid x = 1 \land y = 0.5 \}}$
		Alternatively, we can write this solution set as the ordered pair ${(1,
		0.5).}$ This can in turn be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinate ${(1,
		0.5).}$ If we examined the graphs of equations (2) and (1), we find that the
		coordinate ${(1, 0.5)}$ is the
		<span class="term">point of intersection</span> between the two lines.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Multiplying by a Non-zero Constant.</span> Some linear
		systems aren't immediately conducive to subtraction. For example, consider
		the following linear system:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<ol class="numd">
				<li>${9x + 3y = 6}$</li>
				<li>${2x - 7y = 9}$</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		If we tried subtracting these equations, we would arrive at a third equation
		with two unknowns: ${7x + 10y = 15.}$ That's not very helpful. What we
		instead want to do is manipulate the equations so that we arrive at some
		terms sharing a constant, resulting in a cancellation from subtraction. We
		can do so with multiplication:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 2(9x + 3y &= 6) \\ 9(2x - 7y &= 9) \\ \darr \\ 18x + 6y
			&= 12 \\ 18x - 63y &= 81 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can then apply our familiar subtraction approach:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 18x + 6y &= 12 \\ - (18x - 63y) &= 81 \\ \hline 69y &=
			-69 \\ y &= -1 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Then, plugging our resulting solution for ${y}$ into equation (1):</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			$$ \begin{aligned} 18x + 6(-1) &= 12 \\ 18x - 6 &= 12 \\ 18x - 6 + 6 &= 12
			+ 6 \\ 18x &= 18 \\ x &= 1 \end{aligned} $$
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Our solution set is thus ${\{ x, y \in \R \mid x = 1 \land y = -1 \},}$ or ${(-1,
		1).}$
	</p>
