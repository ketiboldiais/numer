	<h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
	<p>
		The core concern of linear algebra is to solve
		<span class="term">systems of linear equations</span>. Let's start by
		looking at a simple example. First, what is a linear equation? A linear equation is an equation of the form:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>where ${a_n}$ are real or complex number <span class="term">coefficients</span>, ${x_n}$ are real or complex variables, and ${b}$ is some real or complex number. The subscript ${n}$ denotes the ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ term of the equation. In a pedagogical setting, ${n}$ is usually some number less than 10, but in the real world, it could be a million.</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${2x - y = 0}$</p>
			<p>${-x + 2y = 3}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Let's first focus on the coefficients. We can form a rectangular array
		consisting of these coefficients. We call this array the
		<span class="term">coefficient matrix</span>:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		$$ \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $$
	</figure>
	<p>
		The first row represents the coefficients for the first equation and the
		second row represent the coefficients for the second equation. Next, we want
		to write another matrix including the unknowns. Here we have two, ${x}$ and
		${y:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<p>
			$ \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $ $ \begin{bmatrix} x \\
			y \end{bmatrix} $
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>Finally, we want to also write out the matrix for the right-hand side:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<p>
			${ \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y
			\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} }$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>We can refer to these matrices with variables:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<p>
			${ \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}}_{A}
			\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}}_{x} =
			\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}}_{B} }$
		</p>
	</figure>
	<p>The result is some linear equation:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${Ax = B}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In linear algebra, there are generally two &#8220;pictures&#8221; for
		systems of linear equations. When we write out the matrices as we did above,
		we visualized the <span class="italicsText">column picture</span>. Now we
		want to visualize the <span class="italicsText">row picture</span>. To
		visualize the rows, we consider each equation separately. Let's consider the
		first equation. How do we visualize all the points that satisfy ${2x - y =
		0?}$ Well, we could plug in numbers and see. ${(0,0)}$ is a solution. So is
		${(\frac{1}{2}, 2).}$ We could go on and on, but really, we could just plot
		the equation:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="{% static 'images/linalg_1.svg' %}" alt="line 1" loading="lazy" />
	</figure>
	<p>Similarly, let's plot the second equation:</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="{% static 'images/linalg_2.svg' %}" alt="line 2" loading="lazy" />
	</figure>
	<p>
		Notice how the second line does not cross the origin. This immediately tells
		us that ${(0,0)}$ is not a solution to this equation. Whenever we consider
		systems of linear equations, we always want to ask about whether the line
		crosses the origin. This can yield numerous insights very quickly. Let's now
		look at these two lines in conjunction:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/linalg_intersection1.svg' %}"
			alt="intersect"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>
	<p>
		We see that both lines intersect at the point ${(1,2).}$ This is the
		all-important point for our system of equations &mdash; it is the point that
		solves both equations. Now, let's go back to the column picture. Previously,
		we wrote:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${ \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y
				\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} }$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>We can rewrite this as:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${ x \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2
				\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} }$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Writing the matrices in this way, linear algebra asks us to combine the
		matrices in such a way that we get ${\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}.}$ This process of combining the matrices in a particular way is called a <span class="term">linear combination</span>. More specifically, it's a linear combination of the columns.
