<h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		We now explore the topic of linear algebra. If we had to bet on what
		mathematical field would be most useful to laypersons, linear algebra would
		be high on that list. programming; the oil and gas industry; weather
		modeling; economics;planning how much money we need to set aside;
		calculating the quantity of each ingredient needed to serve an 8 course meal
		for 1,000 guests &mdash; these are all problems linear algebra can
		drastically simplify.
