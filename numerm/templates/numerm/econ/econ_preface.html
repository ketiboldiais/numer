<h1>Applied Mathematics II: Economics</h1>
<section id="intro">
	<p>
		<span class="drop">I</span>n this volume, we turn consider mathematical
		applications in the field of economics. Alongside physics, economics is a
		particularly insightful area because of its contributions to game theory. As
		we'll see, economics has contributed a great deal to pure mathematics
		itself, with many leading economists hailing from extensive mathematics
		backgrounds. Moreover, much of the materials we explore in this volume are
		directly applicable to daily life. Economic principles dictate a substantial
		portion of our decisions, as well as others'. We begin by stating the
		foundational axioms of economics &mdash; propositions that will guide our
		mathematical analyses and dicussions.

	<h2>Scarcity</h2>
	<p>
		For every hour we spend studying for an exam, that's an hour spent
		<span class="italicsText">not</span> doing something else. That
		&#8220;something else&#8221; could be making plans for a new business,
		designing a new product, or learning a trade. This is because time is
		<span class="italicsText">scarce</span>. But time isn't the only scare
		resource. Investing ${\$1~000~000}$ into company ${x}$ is ${\$1 ~000~000}$
		not spent on company ${y.}$ ${5\text{s}}$ spent performing algorithm ${A}$
		is ${5\text{s}}$ not spent performing algorithm ${B.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		We call the phenomenon of &#8220;not spent doing&#8221; a
		<span class="term">trade-off</span> &mdash; the outcome of diminishing or
		losing a quality, quantity, or property in return for gains in others.
		Trade-offs exists because of the following axiom:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Axiom.</span> Entities cannot produce all the goods
				and services desired because resources are
				<span class="term">scarce</span>.
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Distilled to its essence, economics is the study of dealing with the axiom
		above: How do entities manage scarce resources? It is the study of
		<span class="italicsText">decisions</span> &mdash; given more than one
		option, a selection of a particular option.
