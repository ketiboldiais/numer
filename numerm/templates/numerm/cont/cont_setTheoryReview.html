<h3>Set Theory</h3>

<p>Continuous mathematics relies heavily on set theory, so it is worth reviewing some key concepts before proceeding further.</p>

<p>Suppose there exists a set $A$. If an entity or discrete mathematical object $a$ belongs to $A$, we write ${a \in A}$ (read "$a$ is an element of $A$"). If $a$ does not belong to $A$, we write ${a \notin A}$ (read "$a$ is not an element of $A$"). If the set $A$ has no elements, then it is the empty set ${\emptyset}$, and we write ${A = \emptyset.}$</p>

<p>Sets can be alluded to verbally, in set roster notation (where all its elements are individually listed), or in set notation (where the set is described in general). For example, the following sets are all identical:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and nine."</li>
	<li>${A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 9 \}}$</li>
	<li>${B = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \lvert x \rvert \leq 3 \}}$</li>
	<li>${C = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="topic">Set Union.</span> Suppose there are two sets, $A$ and $B$. The <span class="term">union</span> of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A \cup B,}$ is the set of all elements of both $A$ and $B$. Visually:</p>

<p><span class="topic">Set Intersection.</span> Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the <span class="term">intersection</span> of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A \cap B,}$ is the set of all elements in both $A$ and $B$. Visually:</p>

	<figcaption>${A \cap B}$</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="topic">Set Difference.</span> Let $A$ and $B$ both be sets. The difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A \setminus B}$ (read "$A$ set minus $B$) is the set of all elements in $A$ and not in $B.$ In other words, ${A \setminus B = \{ x : (x \in A) \land (x \notin B) \}.}$</p>
