	<h3>Intervals</h3>

	<p>
		An <span class="term">interval</span> $I$ is a special kind of set. It is a
		subset of ${\mathbb{R}}$ with the property: If ${s \in I,}$ ${t \in I,}$ and
		${s < x < t,}$ then ${x \in I.}$ In other words, an interval is simply a set
		of real numbers with two explicit members, called
		<span class="term">endpoints</span>, with the added property that every
		number between the two endpoints is also an element of the set. Because
		there are infinitely many real numbers between two different real numbers,
		intervals with distinct endpoints have infinitely many members.
	</p>

	<p>
		Intervals can be restricted to include or exclude its endpoints. If the
		interval excludes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an
		<span class="term">open interval</span>. If the interval includes its
		endpoints, we say that the interval is an
		<span class="term">open interval</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because of the special place intervals have in continuous mathematics, they
		have two different forms of notation: interval notation, and set notation.
		The table below lists some common intervals in both interval and set
		notation.

	<p>
		To graphically indicate that an interval includes its endpoints, we color in
		the the dot marking the endpoint. To indicate exclusion, we leave the mark
		unfilled.
	</p>

	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Lemma.</span> Suppose the interval ${(a, b) \in
			\mathbb{R}^2,}$ and ${a < b.}$ Now suppose there is a number ${\lambda \in
			[0,1].}$ Since ${a < b}$, we can infer ${a - b < 0.}$ We know that
			${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b} = b + \lambda{(a-b)}}$ (simplifying this
			expression will yield ${0 = 0}$.) Since ${a - b < 0,}$ we can solve for
			$b$: ${b = b + 0(a - b) \leq b + 1(a - b) = a.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			Now suppose there is a number ${x \in [a,b],}$ and that ${x = \lambda{a} +
			(1 - \lambda){b}.}$ Solving for ${\lambda,}$ we obtain ${\lambda =
			\dfrac{x - b}{b - a}.}$ Given that ${0 \leq x - b \leq b - a,}$ it is
			evident that ${0 \leq \lambda \leq 1.}$
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, we can infer the following rule: Given the open interval ${(a,b) \in
			\mathbb{R^2}}$ and ${a < b,}$ every number of the form ${\lambda{a} + (1 -
			\lambda)b,}$ ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ belongs to the interval ${[a,b].}$
			Conversely, if ${x \in [a,b],}$ then we can find a ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$
			such that ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Neighborhoods.</span> Suppose ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The
		set $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a <span class="term">neighborhood</span> of $a$ if:
		There exists an open inteval $I$ centered at $a$ such that ${I \subseteq
		\mathcal{N}_a.}$ I.e., $\mathcal{N} _a$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if there
		exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that the open interval ${(a - \delta, a +
		\delta) \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		If $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a neighborhood of $a$, then the notation
		${\mathcal{N}_a \setminus \{ a \}}$ signifies the
		<span class="term">deleted neighborhood</span> of $a$. This implies that
		${\mathcal{N}_a}$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if $a$ has neighbors left and
		right.
	</p>

	<p>For example, consider the following intervals:</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/neighborhoods.svg' %}"
			alt="neighborhoods"
			class="eighty-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The first interval demarcates the neighborhood of $a$. The second interval
		demarcates the <span class="italicsText">sinistral neighborhood</span> of
		$a$. Finally, the third interval demarcates the
		<span class="italicsText">dextral neighborhood</span> of $a$.
	</p>

	<p>
		More formally: Let ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set ${V \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$
		is a <span class="term">dextral neighborhood</span> (right-hand) of $a$ if
		there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that ${[a, a + \delta) \subseteq V.}$ The
		set ${V' \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a
		<span class="term">sinistral neighborhood</span> (left-hand) of $a$ if there
		exists a ${\delta' > 0}$ such that ${(a - \delta', a] \subseteq V'.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		In sum, neighborhoods are open intervals centered at a particular real
		number $a.$ They can be large or small. The intervals ${(-1000, 1000)}$,
		${(-0.00001, 0.00001)}$, and ${(-\pi, \pi)}$ are all neighborhoods of the
		real number 0. Moreover, we can restrict our discussion to certain sections
		of the neighborhood: the sinistral (left-hand) and dextral (right-hand)
		neighborhoods. For example, the interval ${(-100, 0]}$ is the sinistral
		neighborhood of 0, and the interval ${[0, 100)$} is the dextral neighborhood
		of 0.
	</p>

	<p>
		A neighborhood is free to include or exclude its
		<span class="italicsText">reference point</span>. Thus, where ${a \in
		\mathbb{R},}$ the ${\delta \text{-neighborhood} }$ of $a$ is defined as
		${U_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$
		This particular set is simply called the neighborhood of $a$, and the
		variable ${U_{\delta}(a)}$ is equivalent to ${\mathcal{N}_a}$. If, however,
		we were to exclude the reference point $a$, then we obtain what is called a
		<span class="term">reduced neighborhood</span>&mdash;the set ${P_{\delta}(a)
		= \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ Thus, the
		difference between a
		<span class="italicsText">neighborhood of $a$</span> and a
		<span class="italicsText">reduced neighborhood of $a$</span> is that the
		reduced neighborhood of $a$ excludes the reference point $a$, whereas the
		neighborhood of $a$ includes $a$.
