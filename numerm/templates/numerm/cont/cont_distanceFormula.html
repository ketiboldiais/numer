<h1>Distances Between Points</h1>

	<h2>The Pythagorean Theorem and Coordinates</h2>
	<p>
		The Cartesian plane constructs a bridge between algebra and geometry. Many
		theorems and ideas from geometry can be applied in continuous mathematics.
		One such theorem is the <span class="term">Pythagorean theorem</span>:
	</p>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Theorem.</span> Given a right trangle, the lengths of
			the sides are related by the equation: ${ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 }$, where ${ a
			}$ and ${ b }$ are the lengths of the sides forming the right triangle,
			and ${ c }$ is the length of the hypotentuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conversely, if ${ a }$, ${ b }$, and ${ c }$ are the sides of a triangle,
			and all three lengths are related by an equation of the form ${ a^2 + b^2
			= c^2 }$, then the triangle is a right triangle, and ${ c }$ is the
			hypotenuse.

	</div>
	<p>We can visualize the Pythagorean Theorem with the following diagram:</p>

	<h2>The Distance Formula</h2>
	<p>
		The Pythagorean Theorem
		leads directly to the <span class="term">Distance Formula</span>, an
		equation that allows us to compute the distance between two points on the
		Cartesian plane:
