	<h3>The Graph of an Equation</h3>
	<p>
		The graph of an equation is the set of all points with coordinates
		satisfying the equation. For example, suppose we had the equation ${y = x^2
		+ 1}$. Does the point ${(3,10)}$ lie on the equation's graph? Yes. Plugging
		${(3,10)}$ into the equation ${y = x^2 + 1}$, we get ${10 = (3)^2 + 1 = 9 +
		10}$, which is true. Thus, the point ${3,10}$ does indeed lie on the graph.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equations of Lines and Slope.</span> At very small
		intervals, graphs can be viewed as lines. Lines can either slant or remain
		straight, but in both cases, the line has a
		<span class="term">slope</span> &mdash; a number that measures the line's
		direction.
	</p>

	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given two points, ${(x_1, y_1)}$
			and ${(x_2, y_2)}$, the slope of the line passing through the two points
			is the number $m$:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>
		For example, suppose we had two points, ${(-2,-1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$. On the
		Cartesian plane, these two points appear as:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/two_points_plot.svg' %}"
			alt="two point plot"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>The line between these two points is:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${m = \dfrac{5-1}{3-(-2)} = \dfrac{4}{5}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Thus, the line between ${(-2,1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$ has a slope of
		${\frac{4}{5}}$. The slope equation can also be written as:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The variable $\Delta y$ represents the change in $y$-coordinates (${y_2 -
		y_1}$), and the variable $\Delta x$ represents the change in $x$-coordinates
		(${x_2 - x_1}$).
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Comparing Slope.</span> The slope $m$ of a line is a
		real number (${m \in \mathbb{R}}$). Thus, $m$ can be a member of only one of
		three subsets:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>(1) ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$</p>
			<p>(2) ${m = 0}$</p>
			<p>(3) ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		If $m$ is a negative real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ &mdash; then
		the line slants downwards to the right. If $m$ is a positive real number
		&mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$ &mdash; then the line slants upwards to the
		right. If ${m = 0}$, then the line is a perfectly straight
		<span class="underlineText">horizontal</span> line.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given the Cartesian plane, one might wonder, aren't there two cases for
		straight lines: (a) a vertical straight line or (b) a horizontal straight
		line? Yes, there are indeed two cases, straight horizontal lines and
		straight vertical lines. But, the slope is not defined for a vertical line.
		If the two points share the same ordinate (the ${y \text{-coordinate}}$),
		then the line is a horizontal line (e.g., ${(a,b), (c,b)}$). If, however,
		the two points share the same abscissa (the ${x \text{-coordinate}}$), then
		the line is a vertical line (e.g., ${(a,b), (a,c)}$), but the slope is not
		defined. This is because calculating the slope for such a line would lead to
		an undefined result:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${m = \dfrac{b - c}{a - a} = \dfrac{b - c}{0}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Does the magnitude, or size, of $m$ yield any inferences? Yes. ${\lvert m
		\rvert }$ represents the "steepness" of the line. The larger ${\lvert m
		\rvert }$ is, the steeper the line slants (i.e., tending towards a straight
		vertical line), and the smaller ${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the less the line's
		steepness (i.e., tending towards a straight horizontal line).
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Point-Slope Formula.</span> The slope formula can be
		rearranged in another form, yielding the
		<span class="term">point-slope formula</span>.
	</p>

	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Formula.</span> Given a point $P_1{(x_1, y_1)}$, the
			equation of the line passing through ${P_1}$ is given by the equation:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>
		Because of the point-slope formula, it follows that the equation of a
		horizontal line is simply the ordinate of ${P_1}$. For example, suppose
		${P_1 = (4, -2)}$. A horizontal line is a line where ${m = 0}$, so it
		follows that the line's equation is:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${y - (-2) = 0(x - 4)}$</p>
			<p>${y = -2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		We know that a horizontal line will always have a slope of ${m = 0}$. For
		vertical lines, only the $y$-coordinate varies, and the $x$-coordinate
		remains the same. Thus, we can state more general rules for horizontal and
		vertical lines:
	</p>

	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Rule.</span> Given a point ${P_1(a,b)}$, the equation
			of a line passing through ${P_1}$ is ${y = b}$.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Rule.</span> Given a point ${P_2(a,b)}$, the equation
			of a line passing through ${P_2}$ is ${x = a}$.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Slope-Intercept Formula.</span> If we know that a line
		passes through the point ${(0,b)}$, then we can derive yet another equation
		for a line: the <span class="term">slope-intercept form</span>. Since the
		line passes through ${(0,b)}$ (i.e., the line crosses the $y$-axis), using
		the <span class="italicsText">point-slope formula</span>, we can conclude
		that ${y - b = m(x-0)}$. Simplifying and adding $b$ to both sides of the
		equation, we obtain the following rule.
	</p>

	<div class="rule">
		<p>
			<span class="topic">Formula.</span> Given a line with slope $m$ and a
			$y$-intercept $b$, the equation of the line is given by the equation:
		</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${y = mx + b}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>
		If we know that a point satisfies this equation, then it must be the case
		that it lies on the line with the equation. Furthermore, whenever we see an
		equation of this form, we should be immediately aware that the equation
		graphically represents a line.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Parallel and Perpendicular Lines.</span> In geometry, we
		can easily notice that parallel lines slant in the same direction (i.e.,
		they have the same "steepness" to their slant):
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/parallel_lines.svg' %}"
			alt="parallel lines"
			class="seventy-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Because perpendicular lines have the same slant, in algebraic terms, the
		lines have the same slope. Thus, given line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$
		(where $A$ and $B$ are two arbitrary points on the line) with the slope
		$m_1$ and the line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ (where $C$ and $D$ are
		two arbitary points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, the lines
		${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ are
		parallel if, and only if, ${m_1 = m_2}$. In other words, two lines are
		parallel, if and only if, they have the same slope.
	</p>

	<p>
		In contrast, perpendicular lines slant in the exact opposite direction,
		forming 90 degree angles:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/perpendicular_lines.svg' %}"
			alt="perpendicular lines"
			class="seventy-p"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Given that two lines are perpendicular if and only if they form 90 degree
		angles, it follows that for a line to be parallel to another line, the
		line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of the other line. Thus, given
		a line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ (where $E$ and $F$ are arbitrary
		points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and a line
		${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ (where $G$ and $H$ are arbirary points on
		the line) with the slope $m_2$, lines ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ and
		${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ are perpendicular if, and only if, ${m_1 = -
		\dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.
	</p>

	<p>
		To see why a perpendicular line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of
		the other line, consider the following: First, suppose we have three lines,
		$\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and the vertical line ${x = 1}$. Now suppose that
		${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, ${\ell_1}$ has a slope ${m_1}$, and ${\ell_2}$ has
		a slope ${m_2}$. Finally, suppose that ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect
		at the origin, ${(0,0)}$. The lines can be visually represented as:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/proof_perpendicular_lines.svg' %}"
			alt="proof perpendicular lines"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Since ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, we know that that the vertical line ${x = 1}$
		intersects ${\ell_1}$ at ${(1, m_1)}$ and ${\ell_2}$ at ${(1,m_2).}$ This is
		because both lines have a ${\Delta x = 1.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		Where ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect, a right angle, ${\angle ABC}$, is
		formed, since perpendicular lines form right angles. Thus, it follows that
		there is a right triangle ${\triangle ABC,}$ since the resulting triangle
		from ${\angle ABC}$ forms a right triangle.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, consider the distance between the origin, ${B(0,0)}$, and the point
		${A(1,m_1)}$. From the distance formula, the length of ${\overline{\rm BA}}$
		(the distance between $B$ and $A$) is ${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1 +
		{m_1}^2}.}$ Similarly, ${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1 + {m_2}^2}.}$ Thus,
		${\overline{\rm AC} = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (m_1-m_2)^2} = m_1 - m_2.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		From this analysis, we now know all of the lengths of the sides of
		${\triangle ABC}$:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1+{m_1}^2}}$</li>
		<li>${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1+{m_2}^2}}$</li>
		<li>${\overline{\rm AC} = m_1 - m_2}$</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Because we know the lengths for all of the sides of ${\triangle ABC,}$ we
		can express ${\triangle ABC}$ as an equation with the Pythagorean Theorem:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ (\sqrt{1+{m_1}^2})^2 + (\sqrt{1+{m_2}^2})^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2 }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		With this form, we can isolate ${m_1}$ and ${m_2}$ to separate sides of the
		equation:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${1 + {m_1}^2 + 1 + {m_2}^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2}$</p>
			<p>${2 + {m_1}^2 + {m_2}^2 = {m_1}^2 - 2{m_1}{m_2} + {m_2}^2 }$</p>
			<p>${2 = -2{m_1}{m_2}}$</p>
			<p>${-1 = {m_1}{m_2}}$</p>
			<p>${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The analysis above applies regardless of where the point of intersection is,
		since perpendicular lines will always form right triangles. Accordingly, it
		follows that given a line ${\ell_1}$ with the slope ${m_1}$ and a line
		${\ell_2}$ with the slope ${m_2}$, for ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$ to be true,
		it must be the case that ${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.
