<h4>Function Behaviors</h4>

<p>The ways functions map elements from its domain to the elements of its image defines the function's <span class="term">behavior</span>. Function behaviors fall into four types:</p>

<ol>
	<li>general</li>

	<li>injective</li>

	<li>surjective</li>

	<li>bijective</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="topic">General Functions</span>. A <span class="term">general function</span> is one that simply satisfies all of the requirements of a function without a more &mdash; each member of a set $A$ (the domain) points to exactly one member of set $B$ (the codomain). A function is classified as behaving generally if, and only if, no element in its domain points to more than one element in its codomain. In other words, a function such as ${f(x) = 11 \text{ or } 12}$ is <span class="underlineText">not</span> a function that behaves generally.</p>

<p>However, it is perfectly permissible for a general function to have two or more elements in its domain map to the same element in its codomain ("many to one"). It is also permissible for an element in the general function's codomain to go without a corresponding element in the domain. Neither of these properties prevents a function from being classified as behaving generally. For example, the following functions are considered general functions:</p>

<p><span class="topic">Injective Functions</span>. An <span class="term">injective function</span> is one where each element in the function's domain maps to a exactly one and <span class="italicsText">unique</span> element in the function's codomain. In other words, the each element in the function's domain <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> point to the same element in its codomain.</p>

<p>Like the general function, it is perfectly permissible for an element in the injective function's codomain not to have a corresponding element in the function's domain. What is never permissible is "many-to-one" (multiple elements in the domain mapping to the same element in the codomain). This is in contrast to general functions, which allow such behavior. For example, consider the functions below:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="{% static 'images/injective_functions.svg' %}" alt="injective" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
</figure>

<p>The function $g$ is injective, since each element in $A$ is assigned exactly one element in $B$. The function ${f,}$ however, is <span class="underlineText">not</span> injective, since at least two elements in $C$ are assigned the same element in $D.$</p>

<p><span class="topic">Surjective Functions</span>. A <span class="term">surjective function</span> is one where <span class="underlineText">every</span> element in the function's codomain has <span class="italicsText">at least one</span> corresponding element in the function's domain. The fact that an element in the codomain has more than one corresponding element in the domain does not prevent a function from being surjective, but it does prevent a function from being injective. For example:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="{% static 'images/surjective_function.svg' %}" alt="surjectivity" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
</figure>

<p>In the functions above, the functions $u$ and $v$ are surjective, since every element in $B$ and $D$ respectively are assigned to corresponding elements in $A$ and $C$ respectively. The function $w$ is not a surjective function, because one element in $F$ is not assigned to an element in ${E.}$</p>



<p><span class="topic">Bijective Functions</span>. A <span class="term">bijective function</span> is a function that is <span class="underlineText">both</span> surjective <span class="underlineText">and</span> injective. Bijective functions can be thought of as "perfect pairings," in that every element in the domain and every element in the codomain has exactly one corresponding element in the other, and that element is unique. In other words, there is a perfect "one-to-one correspondence" between the members of the domain and the members of the codomain:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="{% static 'images/bijective_function.svg' %}" alt="bijection" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
</figure>

<p>Because bijective functions have perfect one-to-one correspondence, they always have an inverse function. In other words, where a bijective function $b$ maps elements in set $A$ to elements in set $B$, there is an inverse function ${b^{-1}}$ mapping elements in set $B$ to elements in set ${A.}$</p>

<p><span class="topic">Identical Functions.</span> Functions can be identical. Consider the following functions:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>$f(x) = \{ (1,3), (2,3), (4,4) \}$</p>
		<p>$g(x) = \{ (1,3), (2,4), (4,4) \}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Explicitly stating the two functions domain and range:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>$dom(f) = \{ 1, 2, 4 \}$</p>
		<p>$dom(g) = \{ 1, 2, 4 \}$</p>
		<p>$ran(f) = \{ 3, 4 \}$</p>
		<p>$ran(g) = \{ 3, 4 \}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>
	The domains and ranges of $f$ and $g$ are identical, but the
	functions $f$ and $g$ are not. They have different mappings:
</p>

	<img
		src="{% static 'images/functions_unidentical.svg' %}"
		alt="unidentical functions"
		class="sixty-p"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</figure>

<p>The same concept applies for these functions:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>$f(x) = x^3, \space dom(f) = \{ 1, 3 \}$</p>
		<p>$f(x) = x^3, \space dom(f) = \{ 2, 3 \}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>
	The <span class="italicsText">function expressions</span> are the
	same, but the functions themselves are not &mdash; they have
	different domains.
</p>
