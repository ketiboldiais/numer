<h1>Introduction: The Trigonometric Functions</h1>

		Numerous processes are best described as iterating over regular intervals.
		The tides, progression from day to night, business cycles, these are all
		<span class="term">cyclical processes</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In mathematics, the <span class="term">periodic functions</span> is the
		family of functions whose members repeat their values in regular intervals.
		The graph of a periodic function takes the general form of a pattern that
		keeps repeating. Because of this repetition, the functin's graph has the
		same output at exactly the same place in every cycle.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of the property of repetition, all the cycles of a periodic function
		have exactly the same length. This means all periodic functions have a
		helpful base case: The first cycle. If we know all the details of one full
		cycle of a periodic function, then we know all of the function's past and
		future outputs.
	</p>
	<p>
		To begin understanding these functions, we first turn to a subset of the
		periodic functions &mdash; the trigonometric functions.
