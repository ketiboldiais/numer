		Before we study the logarithmic function, we ought to be familiar with the
		logarithm operator, ${\log.}$ Logarithms are simply another way of viewing
		and thinking about exponents.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose the question: What is the 4<sup>th</sup> power of 2? We state this
		question in formal mathematics as: Evaluate ${2^4.}$ The answer, of course,
		is 16: ${2^4 = 16.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		Now suppose the question: What power of 2 is 16? We state this question
		formally as: Evaluate ${\log_{2}(16).}$ The answer here is: ${\log_{2}(16) =
		4.}$ More informally:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				Exponents: ${y = b^x \implies}$ What is the result if I multiply the
				number ${b}$ by itself ${x}$ times?
			</p>
			<p>
				Logarithms: ${x = \log_{b}(y) \implies}$ How many times do I multiply
				${b}$ by itself to get the number ${y?}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Logarithms are simply a way of bringing exponents back to earth. With very
		very large exponents, we get very very large numbers. Logarithms allow us to
		look at those huge numbers in simpler terms. ${10^{100}}$ is a
		<span class="italicsText">googol</span>, the digit 1 followed by 100 zeros,
		or ${1{\footnotesize\text{E}}100.}$ Instead of repeatedly writing such a
		huge number, we can simply think of the number as 100, where
		${\log_{10}(\text{googol}) = 100}$. Similarly, both ${2^4 = 16}$ and
		${\log_{2}(16) = 4}$ express the same relationship between the numbers 2, 4,
		and 16. 2 is the base, 4 is the exponent, and 16 is the power. The only
		difference: Exponential form isolates the power, 16, while logarithmic form
		isolates the exponent, 4.

	<p>We can formalize the definition of a logarithm as the following:</p>

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Where ${x > 0,}$ ${b > 0,}$ and

				The variable ${b}$ is the <span class="italicsText">base</span>; ${c}$
				is the <span class="italicsText">exponent</span>; and ${x}$ is the
				<span class="italicsText">argument</span>.

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Graphs of Logarithmic Functions.</span> The logarithmic
		function effectively &#8220;switches&#8221; the ${x}$ and ${y}$ values in an
		exponential function. Accordingly, the domain and range of the exponential
		function are interchanged. Thus:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition</span>. Given ${f(x) = \log_{b}(x),}$
			</p>

					<p>${\text{ran}(f) = (- \infty , \infty)}$</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Case Analysis: Logarithms.</span> There are four cases
		for analyzing logarithms. Where ${b}$ is the
		<span class="italicsText">base</span>,
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<ul>
			<li>${b \in \R^{-}}$</li>
			<li>${b = 0}$</li>
			<li>${b = 1}$</li>
			<li>${b \in \R^{+} : b \neq 1}$</li>
		</ul>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Of the three cases above, the logarithm is defined only for the last case,
		${b \in \R^{+} : b \neq 1.}$ To see why, we consider the other three cases.
		If ${b \in \R^{-},}$ then we arrive at some difficulty. Remember,
		logarithmic functions are an inverse of the exponential functions. Suppose
		the following:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\log_{-2}(x) = 1/2}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>This would be equivalent to:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${(-2)^{1/2} = \sqrt{-2} = x}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Because the natural domain of the functions we are dealing with is ${\R,}$
		the logarithmic function is <span class="italicsText">undefined</span> where
		${b \in \R^{-}.}$ Now consider where ${b = 0.}$ If ${b = 0,}$ then we again
		run into difficulty:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\log_{0}(x) = 10 = 0^x = 5}$</p>
			<p>${\log_{0}(x) = 100 = 0^x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${\log_{0}(x) = 1000 = 0^x = 1000}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The problem is that 0 raised to any ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power is
		0. Once again, the logarithmic function is undefined, this time for ${b =
		0.}$ Finally, consider where ${b = 1.}$ Following the same approach:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\log_{1}(x) = 10 = 1^x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${\log_{1}(x) = 100 = 1^x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${\log_{1}(x) = 1000 = 1^x = 1000}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Like 0, 1 raised to any ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power is 1. The
		logarithmic function is undefined for ${b = 1.}$ For the reasons above, we
		can never take the logarithm of a negative number, 0, or 1. The
		<span class="italicsText">value</span>, of a logarithm can be negative, 1,
		or 0, but its <span class="italicsText">base</span>, cannot.

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Common Logarithm.</span> In mathematics, the base-10
		logarithm is so common that is often written without its base, 10. This
		logarithm is called <span class="term">common logarithm</span>.

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Binary Logarithm.</span> In a similar vein, the

	<p>
		How do we differentiate between the common logarithm and the binary
		logarithm? Context. In computer science, it is almost always assumed that
		${\log (x)}$ is the binary logarithm, ${\log_{2}(x).}$ In pure mathematics,
		${\log (x)}$ is almost always assumed to be the common logarithm,
		${\log_{10}(x).}$

	<p>
		<span class="topic">The Natural Logarithm.</span> By far, the most

		logarithms are so important in calculus and scientific fields that they are

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Applications of Logarithms.</span> Another way of
		understanding the relationship between logarithms and exponentials is to
		revisit the exponential growth function. Exponents, as a matter of applied
		mathematics, return the amount of
		<span class="italicsText">growth</span> after time ${x}$ &mdash; the
		function ${g(x) = e^x.}$ On the other side, logarithms return the amount of
		<span class="italicsText">time</span> it takes for something to grow to
		${x}$ &mdash; the function ${t(x) = \ln(x).}$ Thus, ${f(x) = e^x}$ allows us
		to input a value of <span class="italicsText">time</span> and obtain the
		<span class="italicsText">growth</span>. ${f(x) = \ln(x)}$ allows us to
		input a value of <span class="italicsText">growth</span> and obtain the
		<span class="italicsText">time it would take to grow</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If we think of logarithms in this manner, then the preceding discussion on
		the bounds of logarithmic functions is much more intuitive. ${ln(1) = 0}$ is
		nonsensical; it does not take any time to grow from 1 to 1, because we
		already are at 1.
	</p>

	<p>
		What about ${ln(-1)?}$ This too is nonsensical in the context of discrete
		real-world objects. If we think of ${g(x) = e^x}$ as measuring the growth
		of, say, a deer population, it would not make sense to have a population of
		-1. Accordingly, ${ln(-1) \implies \text{undefined}.}$ In other words, there
		is no amount of time we can wait to get a negative deer population (again,
		in the context of real-world objects; there is a solution involving
		imaginary exponentials, but we are restricting our functions to the natural
		domain of \R).
	</p>

	<p>
		If we pass a float (a fractional value) into the logarithmic function, then
		we are asking, How long does it take to grow to this fraction of the current
		amount? Suppose we grow continuously at 100%, then asking for, say, the time
		it would take to grow to 1/2 of the current amount requires reversing the
		time (taking the negative time):
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\ln(1/2) = -\ln(2) = -0.693.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		The negative value ${-0.693}$ communicates, Go back 0.693 seconds, and you
		will find half of the current amount. In general, flipping the fraction and
		taking the negative gives us the value of float inputs into the logarithm:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\ln(1/3) = -\ln(3) = -1.09.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Logarithmic Multiplication.</span> Suppose the current
		amount is 1. How long would it take to grow to 9 times the current amount?
		We can break this problem into smaller pieces. The current amount takes an
		${n}$ amount of time to grow 3 times, then another ${m}$ amount of time to
		grow 3 times.
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\ln(9) = \ln(3) + \ln(3)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>In general, we have the following rule:</p>
	<figure>
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given the logarithm ${\ln(ab)}$,
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">

			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Logarithmic Division.</span> When we write ${\ln(3/4)}$
		we are effectively asking, How long does it take to grow 3 times the current
		amount and then take 1/4 of that? The answer: The time it takes to grow 3
		times the current amount is ${\ln(3).}$ The time it takes to grow 1/4 of the
		current amount is ${-\ln(4).}$ Accordingly, ${\ln(3/4) = \ln(3) - \ln(4).}$
		Thus, we have the following rule:

		Notice that the domain and range of the logarithmic function are the domain
		and range of the exponential function, but switched. Recall: Given ${g(x) =
		b^x,}$ where ${b > 0, b \neq 1,}$ ${\text{dom}(g) = (-\infty, \infty) =
		\R.}$ And ${\text{ran}(g) = (0, \infty) = \R_{\geq 0}.}$
	</p>
	<p>
		This switch is apparent when comparing the graphs of ${g(x) = 2^x}$ and

		Notice that ${G(t)}$ &mdash; the graph of the logarithmic function &mdash;
		has a vertical asymptote at ${x = 0.}$ This is because ${\text{dom}(t)}$
		excludes 0. We must always remember this point when handling logarithmic
		functions. Notice further that there are two
		<span class="italicsText">base cases</span>: (1) If ${x = 1,}$ then ${t(x) =
		0.}$ (2) If ${x = b,}$ then ${t(x) = 1.}$ These base cases correspond to two
		key points on the graph of a logarithmic function:
