<h3>Inequalities</h3>

<p>Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$ we obtain an <span class="term">inequality</span>. Both equations and inequalities are mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like equations, have truth sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the inequality true if any member of that set is substituted into a variable, or variables, of the inequality.</p>

<p>For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 = 17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
		<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
		<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
		<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
		<p>&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling. Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$ If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 < 30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation returns 2 general rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive real number, then the inequality is preserved.</li>
	<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative real number, then the inequality is reversed.</li>
</ul>

<p>More explicit rules:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
	<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and ${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$</li>
	<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and ${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$</li>
	<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>
</ol>
