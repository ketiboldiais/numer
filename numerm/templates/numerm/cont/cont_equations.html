	<p>
		<span class="topic">Truth Sets.</span> Because expressions contain
		variables, an equation is true or false if, and only if, we substitute
		values into those variables. Until then, an equation is neither true nor
		false. If a value is inputted and the equation is true, we call that value
		the <span class="term">solution</span>, or <span class="term">root</span>,
		of the equation. The set of all roots to an equation is called the
		equation's <span class="term">truth set</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="topic">Identities.</span> If an equation's truth set is the
		equation's domain, we say that equation is an
		<span class="term">identity</span>. For example, the equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)$, and</p>
			<p>$\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
		substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations true.
	</p>

	<h5>Conditional Equations</h5>
	<p>
		The opposite of an identity is a
		<span class="term">conditional equation</span>. These are equations that are
		true <span class="italicsText">only if</span> some condition(s) is/are true.
		For example, the following are conditional equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$2x = 10$</p>
			<p>$x = x + 1$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The equation
		$x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that equals one more than
		itself (a condition that can never be satisfied, so the equation can never
		be true).
	</p>

	<h5>Equivalent Equations</h5>
	<p>
		<span class="topic">Equivalent Equations.</span> Equivalent expressions are
		represented by expressions. Equations themselves can be equivalent. Two
		equations are equivalent if, and only if, they have exactly the same
		solutions.
	</p>

	<h3>Linear Equations in One Variable</h3>

	<p>
		Because equations often share properties, they can be classified into
		various kinds. One such kind is a
		<span class="term">linear equation in one variable</span>. A linear equation
		in one variable is an equation that can be written in the form:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>
				${ax + b = 0}$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and ${a \neq 0.}$
			</p>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For example, all of the equations below are one-variable linear equations:
	</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${5x = 10}$</p>
			<p>${2m + 3 = 19}$</p>
			<p>${\dfrac{y}{3} = \dfrac{y}{5} + 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
