<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>A function is simply a relationship, or, in formal mathematics, a <span class="italicsText">relation</span> between mathematical objects. There are many relations in mathematics (equality, inequality, congruence, proximity, etc.). Functions are just one kind of relation. Most commonly, functions are relations between numbers, where one number shares a specific relationship, defined by a rule, to exactly one number. Do not confuse this idea of "one-to-one" with "one-to-unique." A relation can still be a function even if one or more numbers are related to the same number.</p>

<p>Functions can be represented in a variety of ways. We can represent functions algebraically, using an equation or formula: ${f(x) = \ln x,}$ ${g = \sqrt{h}}$, or ${F = ma}$. We can represent functions verbally: "For every $x$, there is a $y$ such that $y$ is $x$ squared." We can represent functions with tables, where one column lists the values of $x$, and another lists their corresponding $y$ values. Finally, we can represent functions with graphs, using a coordinate system. Regardless of the way we represent them, functions all express the same idea: a relationship where one mathematical object maps to exactly one mathematical object, according to a rule.</p>

<p>A more formal definition: Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets. A <span class="term">function</span> from $A$ to $B$ is a <span class="italicsText">rule of correspondence</span> that assigns, or maps, to each element in $A$ <span class="underlineText">exactly one</span> element in ${B.}$</p>

<p>Consider the following relations:</p>

	<img src="{% static 'images/functions_or_not.svg' %}" alt="relation compare" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
</figure>

<p>The relation $u$ maps the elements of $A$ to the elements of ${B.}$ The relation $v$ maps the elements of $C$ to the elements of ${D.}$ And the relation $w$ maps the elements of $E$ to the elements of ${F.}$ The relation $u$ is a function, since it maps each element of $A$ to exactly one element of $B.$ The same goes for relation $v$ &mdash; each element of $C$ is mapped to exactly one element of ${D,}$ even if some elements of $C$ map to the same element of ${D.}$ The relation ${w,}$ however, is <span class="underlineText">not</span> a function, since at least one element of $E$ is mapped to more than one element of ${F.}$</p>

<p>We often refer to the inputs of a function with the variable $x$, and the outputs of the function with the variable $y$, or $f(x)$.  The input, $x$, is also called the <span class="italicsText">independent variable</span>, and the output, $f(x)$, is called the <span class="italicsText">dependent</span> variable.</p>

<p>A function will never give more than one output for one input. There are, of course, relationships where on number outputs more than one number. Those relationships, however, are not characterized by, or as, functions. We will explore those relationships later in due time.</p>

<div class="rule">
	<p><span class="topic">Definition</span> Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set Cartesian product $A \times B$ the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$, where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.  A subset of $A \times B$ is called a <span class="term">relation</span>.</p>
	<p>A <span class="term">function</span> is a special kind of relation. It is a pairing of elements in $A$ with elements in $B$, where each eleemnt in $A$ is paired with exactly one element in $B$.  Thus, a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a rule or relation between $A$ and $B$ that <span class="italicsText">assigns</span>, or <span class="italicsText">maps</span>, each element $a \in A$ to <span class="underlineText">one</span> element in $b \in B$.</p>
	<p>If a function is a subset of $A \times B$, then $A$ is the <span class="term">domain</span> of the function, and $B$ is the <span class="term">range</span> of the function.</p>
	<p>Every function has a <span class="term">natural domain</span> (also called the <span class="italicsText">implied domain</span>). The natural domain of a function is the set of all elements for which the function is defined. Whenever we analyze or discuss a function, we set a natural domain. That natural domain acts as the boundary of our analysis.  For example, when we discuss the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, we may specify that the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Because the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $f$ cannot include negative real numbers, since $\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for $\mathbb{R}^{-}$. Because of this fact, we specify the domain of $f$ as:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>$dom(f) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \geq 0 \}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="topic">Properties of Functions</span>. Functions can be identified by several properties:</p>

<ol>
	<li>a set of inputs, called the function's <span class="term">domain</span>, denoted ${dom(f),}$ e.g., the domain of the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ is ${dom(f) = \mathbb{R};}$</li>

	<li>a set of all <span class="italicsText">possible</span> inputs, called the function's <span class="term">natural domain</span>, denoted ${D(f),}$ e.g., the natural domain of the function ${c(d) = \sqrt{d}}$ is ${ D(c) = \mathbb{R}}$, but the domain of the function is ${dom(d) = \{ d \in \mathbb{R} \mid d \geq 0 \};}$ in set notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${dom(f) \subseteq D(f);}$</li>

	<li>a set of outputs, called the function's <span class="term">range</span>, or <span class="term">image</span>, denoted ${ran(f)}$ or ${Im(f),}$ e.g., the function ${y(w) = \dfrac{1}{w}}$ has the range of ${Im(y) = \mathbb{R};}$</li>

	<li>a set of all <span class="italicsText">possible</span> outputs, called the function's <span class="term">codomain</span>, or <span class="term">target</span>, denoted ${\text{target}(f),}$ e.g., the function ${h(z) = z + 1}$ has a codomain of ${\text{target}(h) = \mathbb{R},}$ but if we restricted ${dom(h) = \{ 1,2 \},}$ then ${Im(h) = \{ 2,3 \},}$ but its codomain remains ${\text{target}(h) = \mathbb{R};}$ in set notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${Im(f) \subseteq \text{target}(f);}$</li>

	<li>a name for a typical input, called a <span class="term">dummy variable</span>, e.g., the function ${g(p) = \dfrac{1}{p} }$ has the dummy variable $p$;</li>

	<li>a name for the function, e.g., the function ${m(j) = \ln j}$ has the name ${m(j);}$</li>

	<li>an assignment rule or formula assigning to every element of the domain exactly one element of the <span class="term">codomain</span>, e.g., the function ${r(t) = t^2 + 4t + 1}$ has the assignment rule ${t^2 + 4t + 1;}$</li>

	<li>some functions have graphs, denoted ${G(f).}$ (We say "some" because a function need not concern numbers. A relation mapping common fruit names to their respective scientific names is just as much a function as ${s(t) = \sqrt{t - 1}.)}$</li>
</ol>

	
<p><span class="topic">Arrow Notation for Functions.</span> All functions can be represented in arrow notation:</p>

<figure><img src="{% static 'images/properties_functions_mapping.svg' %}" alt="function map" loading="lazy"></figure>

<p>For example, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$, in arrow notation, is ${f: x \mapsto x^2,}$ and its domain and codomain are represented as ${\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$ The benefit of arrow notation is that it allows us to easily restrict a function's inputs and outputs, which in turn allows us to differentiate functions explicitly. This is a particularly useful asset when the functions share the same assignment rule:</p>

<p>Suppose the function ${f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 4.}$ The functions below all have the same assignment rule as ${f,}$ but they are all different functions:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${f: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$</p>

		<p>${g: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${g: \mathbb{R} \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$</p>

		<p>${h: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${h:  [0, + \infty) \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$</p>

		<p>${i: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${i:  [0, + \infty) \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>The function $f$ is neither injective nor surjective, the function $b$ is injective but not surjective, the function $c$ is surjective but not injective, and the function $d$ is a bijection.</p>

<p>Note that in the last function, the function name $i$ was used. This is generally considered poor writing in mathematics, as the letter $i$ is almost always exclusively reserved for the imaginary number $i$ (setting aside the unorthodox practices of electrical engineers using $j$).</p>
