<h3>Quadratic Equations</h3>

<p>There are three primary ways of finding the truth set of quadratic equations:</p>

<ol>
	<li>using the square root method,</li>
	<li>factoring,</li>
	<li>completing the square, and</li>
	<li>using the quadratic equation</li>
</ol>

<p>The next few sections explore how each of these methods are used.</p>
	
<p><span class="topic">Completing the Square.</span> Given the quadratic equation ${x^2 + Ax = B}$ ompleting the square can be summarized into a simple algorithm:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Look at the cofficient of ${x}$, $A.$</li>
	<li>Divide the coefficient by 2: ${\dfrac{A}{2}.}$</li>
	<li>Square the result: ${\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2.}$</li>
	<li>
		Add the number from step 1 to both sides of the equation: ${x^2 -
		Ax + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2 = B +
		\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2.}$
	</li>
	<li>Simplify the equation.</li>
	<li>Factor the result.</li>
	<li>Solve for $x.$</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, suppose we were confronted by the quadratic equation: ${x^2 - 2x = 4.}$ Applying the method of completing the square, we look at the coefficient of $x$ first. We see that it is -2. We divide this number by 2 and square it: ${\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.}$ Then we add this number to both sides of the equation: ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.}$ Simplifying, we obtain ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5.}$ We factor the left-hand side, and reach ${(x-1)(x-1) = 5,}$ or, with a square, ${(x-1)^2 = 5.}$ Taking the square root of both sides, we have ${x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}}$ (always be mindful of the the fact that squares result from both positive and negative numbers). Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by adding 1 to both sides: ${x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.}$ Thus, the truth set of the equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is ${x \in \{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5} \}.}$</p>

<p><span class="topic">The Quadratic Formula</span> From the method of completing the square, we can derive the <span class="term">quadratic formula</span>, a formula that allows us to quickly deduce the truth set of a quadratic equation.</p>

<p>To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general quadratic equation: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide both sides by $a$, and obtain:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) = 0.}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right).}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both sides:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} = \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a}}$</p>
		<p>${\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$</p>
		<p>${x + \dfrac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} = \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert }}$</p>
		<p>${= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x \in \left\{-\dfrac{b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \space - \dfrac{b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right\}}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>The quadratic formula will <span class="underlineText">always</span> yield the truth set for quadratic equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In the event that the term ${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the <span class="italicsText">discriminant</span>), however, the truth set of the equation consists of <span class="italicsText">complex numbers</span>, rather than <span class="italicsText">real numbers</span>.</p>
		
<p><span class="topic">The Discriminant.</span> In the quadratic formula, the expression that appears below the radical sign, ${b^2 - 4ac,}$ is called the <span class="term">discriminant</span>. If the discriminant evaluates to a positive real number, then the quadratic equation has 2 real solutions. If the discriminant evaluates to 0, then the quadratic equation has only 1 real solution. If the discriminant evaluates to a negative real number, then the quadratic equation has no real solutions &mdash; instead, it has a pair of complex conjugate solutions. Generalizing these results:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		$$
			\text{roots} \begin{cases}
			\text{1 distinct real root} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac > 0 \\ 
			\text{2 distinct real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\ 
			\text{0 real roots} &\text{iff } b^2 - 4ac < 0 
			\end{cases}
		$$

<p><span class="topic">The Product &amp; Sum of the Roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$</span> Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the roots of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation: ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Then let's use the quadratic formula:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}$</p>
		<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)}}$</p>
		<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+20}}{2}}$</p>
		<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${ x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) = \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4}}$</p>
		<p>${= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4} = \dfrac{-20}{4} = -5}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the two roots?</p>
<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} = \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
		<p>${= \dfrac{-6}{2} = -3}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two roots is -5, the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots, -3, is the negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In fact, it follows from a more general rule.</p>

<p>Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation ${x^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ It follows that ${r_1 r_2 = c}$ and ${r_1 + r_2 = -b.}$ In other words, the product of the roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is the constant term in the equation, $c$, and the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$ (i.e., $-b$).</p>

<p>The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula. Suppose there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a = 1.}$ From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the equation are:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x = \dfrac{-b \pm  \sqrt{b^2 - 4(1)c}}{2(1)} = \dfrac{-b \pm  \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}.}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Thus, the roots are:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${r_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
		<p>${r_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>The products of the roots:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${r_1 r_2 = \left(\dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}\right) \left( \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} \right)}$</p>
		<p>${\phantom{r_1 r_2}  = \dfrac{b^2 - \left( b^2 - 4c \right)}{4} = \dfrac{4c}{4} = c}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>And the sum of the roots:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${r_1 + r_2 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} + \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}}$</p>
		<p>${\phantom{r_1 + r_2} = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4c} + (-b) - \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} = \dfrac{-2b}{2} = -b}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p><span class="topic">The Reasoning Behind Completing the Square.</span> The method of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose we had a square, ${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="images/square_of_length_x.svg" alt="square" class="thirty-p" loading="lazy"/>
</figure>

<p>We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose that we were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of $x$ to the square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add the rectangle, we obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$</p>

<figure><img src="images/rectangles_added_completing_the_square.svg" alt="rectangle added" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>

<p>Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the added rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original square's side, and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:</p>

<figure><img src="images/rearrange_completing_the_square.svg" alt="rearrangement" class="forty-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>

<p>Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape that would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the rectange we created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the two halves we created must respectively have an area of ${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$ Thus, the shape we need to fill the gap must have an area of ${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or, simplifying the expression, ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$</p>

<p>To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape above without filling the gap. That shape has an area of ${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 + bx.}$ When we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing square": ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area of the incomplete shape is a quadratic equation.</p>

<p>If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our original square has an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations needlessly difficult, and we want our original shape to be a square of area ${x^2}$. Since $a$ is a constant, we can get rid of its place before $x$ by dividing all of the terms in the equation by $a:$</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${ x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the equation, to give us our incomplete shape:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$</p>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>The term ${\dfrac{b}{a}}$ represents the side of our added rectangle. The side of our halved rectangles then, is ${\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)}{2} = \dfrac{b}{2a}}$. And since ${\dfrac{b}{2a}}$ represents the side of our halved rectangles, the missing square has an area of ${\left(\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\dfrac{b}{2a}\right) = \dfrac{b^2}{4a},}$ the term we add to both sides of ${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$</p>

<p>Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of the equation can be found with the equation:</p>

<figure class="math-display">
	<div>
		<p>
			${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a} = -
			\dfrac{c}{a} + \dfrac{b^2}{4a}}$
		</p>
	</div>
