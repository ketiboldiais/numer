	<h3>The Cartesian Plane</h3>
	<p>
		Continuous mathematics depends heavily on graphs. One way to represent
		graphs is through the Cartesian plane:

	<p>
		The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular real number lines. The
		point where the lines intersect is 0, and is called the
		<span class="term">origin</span>. The horizontal number line is usually
		called the <span class="term">$x$-axis</span>, and the vertical number line
		the <span class="term">$y$-axis</span>. On the $x$-axis, all points to the
		right of the origin represent the positive real numbers, and all points to
		the left of the origin represent the negative real numbers. On the $y$-axis,
		all points above the origin reprepresent the positive real numbers, and all
		points below the origin represent the negative real numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		A point on the Cartesian plane is represented by an
		<span class="term">ordered pair</span>, of the form ${ x, y }$, where ${ x
		}$ is a point on the $x$-axis, and ${ y }$ is a point on the $y$-axis. For
		example:

	</figure>
	<p>
		Each of the points in the diagram above are
		<span class="term">Cartesian coordinates</span>, or simply
		<span class="italicsText">coordinates</span>. The $x$-coordinate is formally
		called the <span class="term">abscissa</span> of the point, and the
		$y$-coordinate the <span class="term">ordinate</span>. When we refer to
		coordinates generally, or in the abstract, we write:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${ P(x,y) }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>The notation above is read "the point ${ (x,y) }$."</p>
