	<h3>Transcendental Functions</h3>
	<p>The <span class="term">transcendental functions</span> are the functions that are not algebraic functions. This family of functions includes the trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, as well as a gargantuan number of functions that have yet to be named.</p>
	<p>Some examples of such functions:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = \sin x}$</p>
			<p>${g(t) = 2^t}$</p>
			<p>${h(r) = \log_{3}r}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Transcendental functions are mentioned here to acknowledge their existence early on, but a thorough treatment is provided in the Calculus title, where they are explored as sums of infinite series.</p>
