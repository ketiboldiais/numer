<h1>Transcendental Functions</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		The <span class="term">transcendental functions</span> are the functions
		that are not algebraic functions. This family of functions includes the
		trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic
		functions, as well as a gargantuan number of functions that have yet to be
		named.
	</p>
	<p>Some examples of such functions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>${f(x) = \sin x}$</li>
		<li>${g(t) = 2^t}$</li>
		<li>${h(r) = \log_{3}r}$</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Transcendental functions are mentioned here to acknowledge their existence
		early on, but a thorough treatment is provided in the Calculus title, where
		they are explored as sums of infinite series.
	</p>
