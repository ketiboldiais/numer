		<span class="topic">Domain of an Expression.</span> All mathematical
		expressions have a <span class="term">domain</span> &mdash; the set of all
		values for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the domain of an
		expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're discussing. For
		example, if we were debating the costs and benefits of capitalism, the
		debate might be limited to economies that exist today, rather than the
		economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is that, outside of the domain,
		the expression is undefined &mdash; all bets are off.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, since it
		is defined for all real numbers. We denote the domain of $3x + 4$ with the
		notation: $dom(3x + 4) = \mathbb{R}$.

		<span class="topic">Problem.</span> What is the domain of
		$\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}$?
	</p>

	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>
			$dom(\dfrac{1}{(t-1)(t+3)}) = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \mid t \neq 1, t \neq
			-3\}$.
		</p>
		<p>
			We impose restrictions on the domain, since $t = 1$ and $t = -3$ lead to
			the denominator evaluating to 0, which is undefined.

		<span class="topic">Problem.</span> What is the domain of $4x + 3x^{-1}$?
	</p>
	<details class="answer">
		<summary>Solution</summary>
		<p>${4x + 3x^{-1} = 4x + \dfrac{3}{x}.}$</p>
		<p>${dom(4x + \dfrac{3}{x}) = \{ \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq 0 \}.}$</p>
