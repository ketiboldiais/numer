		<span class="topic">Proving $f$ is Increasing or Decreasing.</span> Consider
		the function ${f(x) = x^2.}$ How might we prove that ${f}$ is increasing on
		the interval ${[0, \infty)?}$ Our algorithms above work only if we have an
		<span class="term">interval</span>, or more generally,
		<span class="term">bounded sets</span> &mdash; intervals with specified
		endpoints, or finite intervals. Here, we have an
		<span class="term">unbounded set</span>. In this case, a
		<span class="term">right-open</span> interval (an interval with no maximum).
		The same limitation would apply if we had a
		<span class="term">left-open</span> interval (an interval with no mimimum).
		In this situation, we need to more carefully think about what it means to be
		increasing or decreasing.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, understand the problem. We're trying to prove that the function
		${f(x) = x^2}$ is increasing on the interval ${[0, \infty).}$ Because there
		is no maximum for this interval, what we are really being asked to prove is:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(x) = x^2}$ is increasing for ${0 \leq a < b.}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		To prove this, we must show the following statement is always true for ${0
		\leq a < b:}$
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${f(a) < f(b)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>Accordingly, we must prove that this is true:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0 \leq f(a) < f(b)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>This statement consists of several component propositions:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0 = f(a) < f(b) \equiv 0 < f(b)}$</p>
			<p>${0 < f(a) < f(b)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In both these statements, ${f(a) < f(b).}$ Thus, the two component
		propositions imply that:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0 < f(b) - f(a)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>With this restatement of the problem, we can infer:</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${0 < f(b) - f(a) = b^2 - a^2}$</p>
			<p>${\phantom{0 < f(b) - f(a)} = (b + a) (b - a)}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Now, we know that ${0 \leq a < b}$ implies that ${0 < b + a,}$ and ${0 < b -
		a.}$ Thus, it follows that ${(b + a)(b - a)}$ can never be less than or
		equal to 0. Accordingly, ${0 < (b + a)(b - a)}$ is true. Hence, the function
		${f(x) = x^2}$ is increasing on the half-open interval ${[0, \infty.)}$
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, how might we prove that ${f(x) = x^2}$ is
		<span class="italicsText">decreasing</span> for the interval ${(- \infty,
		0]?}$
