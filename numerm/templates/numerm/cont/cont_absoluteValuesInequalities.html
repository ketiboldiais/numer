		<span class="topic">Absolute Values and Inequalities.</span> Whenever we see
		absolute values in inequalities, we should be on high alert. Suppose that
		${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ ${u \in \mathbb{R},}$ and ${a > 0.}$ The following
		rules hold:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff -a < u < a}$</p>
			<p>${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff (u < -a \text{ or } u > a) }$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
	<p>
		These rules follow from observing the number line. The statement ${-a < u <
		a}$ implies that $u$ is somewhere between $-a$ and $a$, which is equivalent
		to saying that the distance from $u$ to 0 is less than $a$ (which, in
		mathematical notation, is simply ${\lvert u \rvert < a }$).
	</p>
	<p>
		When inequalities contain expressions couched between absolute value
		symbols, the inequality is effectively expressing the expression's distance
		from 0. For example, suppse ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert < 1. }$ This statement
		tells us that the distance of ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert }$ from 0 is less than
		1. Visually, this appears as:
	</p>
	<figure>

	</figure>
	<p>
		Because absolute values tell us the distance from 0, the statement above,
		${\lvert x - 3 \rvert < 1,}$ allows us to infer:
	</p>
	<figure class="math-display">
		<div>
			<p>${-1 < x - 3 < 1}$</p>
		</div>
	</figure>
