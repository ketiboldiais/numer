	<p>
		<span class="topic">Radians v. Degrees.</span> A unit
		<span class="italicsText">degree</span> is a ratio. More specifically,
		${{1}^\circ = 1/360.}$ The constant ${{360}^\circ}$ constants a full
		circular rotation. Why 360? Purely arbitrary. It so happens that 360 divides
		nicely, and works well with time measures (i.e., 60 seconds to a minute; 60
		seconds to an hour; in ancient calendars, there were 360 days in a year; and
		the ancient Babylonians had a base-60 number system &mdash; in essence, more
		than likely a cultural artifact).
	</p>

	<p>
		Under the degree unit, a circle is defined to have ${{360}^\circ.}$ Thus, a
		perfect horizontal angle (a <span class="term">straight angle</span>) has a
		measure of ${{180}^\circ.}$ A <span class="term">right angle</span> has a
		measure of ${{90}^\circ.}$ An angle with a measure less than ${{90}^\circ}$
		is called an <span class="term">acute angle</span>, and an angle with a
		measure greater than ${{90}^\circ}$ is an
		<span class="term">obtuse angle</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If we measure an angle counterclockwise from the initial side, the angle is
		called a <span class="term">positive angle</span>, and has a positive number
		measure. Inversely, if we measure an angle clockwise from the initial side,
		the angle is called a <span class="term">negative angle</span>, and has a
		negative number measure. Angles whose terminal side lies on an axis &mdash;
		those with measures ${{0}^\circ,}$ ${{90}^\circ,}$ ${{270}^\circ,}$ and
		${{360}^\circ}$ &mdash; are called
		<span class="term">quadrantal angles</span>.

		Degrees are what most non-mathematicians are familiar with, and is the unit
		we most often encounter at a hardware store. Degrees, however, are not an
		ideal unit when handling trigonometric functions and equations in
		higher-level mathematics. Instead,
		<span class="italicsText">radians</span> are what mathematicians most often
		use. This is because when degrees are used as units in calculus and other
		more complex fields, they almost always end up being converted to radians,
		then back to degrees. This is an unnecessary computation since we could have
		just started with radians in the first place.
	</p>

	<p>
		So what are radians? First, suppose we have a circle with a radius of length
		${r:}$
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/circle_radius_r.svg' %}"
			alt="circle r"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>Now suppose there is an angle on the circle:</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/circle_r_subtends.svg' %}"
			alt="circle r subtends"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		On the circle, there is an arc, indicated in red, that
		<span class="term">subtends</span> the ${\theta,}$ meaning the path along
		the circle that intersects the two sides of the angles. Suppose that
		${theta}$ is the exact right size such that the length of the arc is ${r,}$
		the radius. Because the arc is equal to the radius of the circle, let's just
		say that ${\theta = 1 \text{ radian}.}$ This is exactly how the unit radians
		is defined.
	</p>

	<p>Now, what might be the measure of this angle:</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/circle_r_full.svg' %}"
			alt="full subtend"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Well, the arc that subtends the angle ${\theta}$ is the entire circle. This
		means the length of that arc is the
		<span class="italicsText">circumference</span> of the circle. And the
		circumference of this circle is ${2 \pi r,}$ where ${r}$ is the radius.
		Hence, the measure of the angle ${\theta}$ is ${2 \pi \text{ radians}.}$
	</p>

	<p>
		Given these facts, it should now be clear why radians are the preferred unit
		for measuring angles. They are
		<span class="underlineText">purely</span> mathematical:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<img
			src="{% static 'images/circle_radians.svg' %}"
			alt="circle full"
			loading="lazy"
		/>
	</figure>

	<p>A more formal definition is provided here:</p>

	<figure class="math-display">
		<div class="rule">
			<p>
				<span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose there is an angle
				${\theta}$ with a vertex at the center of a circle with radius ${r.}$
				Let ${s}$ denote the length of arc subtended by ${\theta.}$ Assuming
				${s}$ and ${r}$ have the same linear units, the radian measure of
				${\theta}$ is the ratio of the arc length ${s}$ to the radius ${r.}$
			</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\theta = \dfrac{s}{r}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
		</div>
	</figure>

	<p>
		Radians can be easily converted to degrees. From the diagram above, we know
		that ${2 \pi \text{ rad} = {360}^\circ,}$ ${\dfrac{\pi}{2} \text{ rad} =
		{90}^\circ,}$ ${\dfrac{\pi}{4} \text{ rad} = {45}^\circ,}$ etc. Because a
		radian is simply a ratio of two lengths (the radius and the arc,) we need
		not include the unit &#8220;rad.&#8221; When it is included, it is simply
		used to indicate an angle measurement. Accordingly, we can simply write ${2
		\pi,}$ ${\dfrac{\pi}{4},}$ and so on. The variable ${r}$ is actually a
		constant, since all angle measures using radians can be expressed as the
		measure of an angle on the <span class="term">unit circle</span>, a circle
		with radius of length 1. Accordingly, we can simply omit the constant ${r}$
		when using radians. It is precisely because of this property that
		mathematicians prefer the radius &mdash; computations and algebraic
		manipulations are much, much cleaner.
